nights<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.750> freddy's<00:00:04.140> theory<00:00:04.500> today<00:00:05.069> we're

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
nights at freddy's theory today we're

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.829 
nights at freddy's theory today we're
going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.700> over<00:00:05.970> why<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> think

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
going to be going over why I think

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
going to be going over why I think
there's<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.109> possibility<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:07.950> spring<00:00:08.700> trap

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
there's the possibility that spring trap

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.049 
there's the possibility that spring trap
is<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.389> cause<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.110> bite<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.429> 87<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.880> let's

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
is the cause of the bite of 87 so let's

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.700 
is the cause of the bite of 87 so let's
get<00:00:12.210> straight<00:00:12.389> into<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.559> you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
get straight into this so if you

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.650 
get straight into this so if you
remember<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> trailers<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.030> actually<00:00:15.450> see

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
remember in the trailers we actually see

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
remember in the trailers we actually see

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to something that's been there for quite

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.179 
to something that's been there for quite
a<00:00:25.619> while<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.330> something<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:28.019> tied<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
a while and something that is tied to

the fazbear entertainment chain and what

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
the fazbear entertainment chain and what
I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> could<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.250> referring<00:00:33.059> to

I think this could be is referring to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
I think this could be is referring to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
five nights at Freddy's 2 you can

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.090 
five nights at Freddy's 2 you can
actually<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.049> there's<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.560> wall<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
actually see there's a little wall that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
actually see there's a little wall that
kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> goes<00:01:35.579> behind<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.140> all

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
kind of goes behind and what we all

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
kind of goes behind and what we all
think<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.920> where<00:01:38.460> golden<00:01:38.909> Freddy<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.960> what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
think is where golden Freddy is but what

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
think is where golden Freddy is but what
if<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.439> also<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:40.979> spring-trap<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.850> keep

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
if it's also where spring-trap is keep

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.179 
if it's also where spring-trap is keep
in<00:01:42.659> mind<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.290> didn't<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.710> anything

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in mind that we didn't know anything

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
in mind that we didn't know anything
about<00:01:44.610> golden<00:01:45.240> Freddy<00:01:45.540> being<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> second

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
about golden Freddy being in the second

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.380 
about golden Freddy being in the second
game<00:01:46.590> until<00:01:47.070> night<00:01:47.280> six<00:01:47.670> winned<00:01:48.060> phone<00:01:48.240> guy

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
game until night six winned phone guy

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
game until night six winned phone guy
starts<00:01:48.689> talking<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:49.290> him<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> he<00:01:49.710> begins

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
starts talking about him and he begins

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
starts talking about him and he begins
to<00:01:50.100> appear<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.520> office<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.360> Scott<00:01:51.600> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to appear in your office so if Scott can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
to appear in your office so if Scott can
keep<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.140> Freddy<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.590> secret<00:01:52.950> from<00:01:53.130> us<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
keep going Freddy a secret from us in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
keep going Freddy a secret from us in
the<00:01:53.549> second<00:01:53.939> game<00:01:54.090> until<00:01:54.630> night<00:01:54.840> six<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.500> easy

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the second game until night six how easy

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.050 
the second game until night six how easy
could<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.460> Scott<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> keep

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
could it be for Scott to keep

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
could it be for Scott to keep
spring-trap<00:01:57.719> an<00:01:57.930> entire<00:01:58.320> secret<00:01:58.890> from<00:01:59.100> us

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
spring-trap an entire secret from us

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.469 
spring-trap an entire secret from us
throughout<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> five<00:01:59.880> nights<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.240> Freddy's<00:02:00.450> 2

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
throughout the five nights at Freddy's 2

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
throughout the five nights at Freddy's 2
game<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.860> evidence<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
game so with this evidence that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.429 
game so with this evidence that
spring-trap<00:02:03.270> could<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> been<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
spring-trap could have been there in

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.109 
spring-trap could have been there in
five<00:02:04.680> nights<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.130> Freddy's<00:02:05.430> 2<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:06.090> can

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
five nights at Freddy's 2 we can

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
five nights at Freddy's 2 we can
actually<00:02:06.509> come<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> possibility<00:02:07.860> on

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually come up with a possibility on

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
actually come up with a possibility on
why<00:02:08.459> he<00:02:08.849> could<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.149> committed<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> bite<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
why he could have committed the bite of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.540 
why he could have committed the bite of
87<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.890> guys<00:02:11.099> remember<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.520> last

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
87 if you guys remember in the last

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.570 
87 if you guys remember in the last
video<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.030> actually<00:02:12.300> talked<00:02:12.720> about<00:02:12.989> how

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
video I actually talked about how

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330 
video I actually talked about how
ring<00:02:13.700> trap<00:02:14.110> actually<00:02:15.110> has<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.710> legitimate

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
ring trap actually has a legitimate

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.220 
ring trap actually has a legitimate
spring-trap<00:02:17.120> inside<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.630> his<00:02:17.720> mouth<00:02:17.750> or<00:02:18.140> at

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
spring-trap inside of his mouth or at

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
spring-trap inside of his mouth or at
least<00:02:18.410> that's<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.830> looks<00:02:18.920> like<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.580> if

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
least that's what it looks like and if

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.060 
least that's what it looks like and if
that<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.030> true<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.750> would<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.050> very<00:02:21.080> very<00:02:21.470> easy

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
that is true it would be very very easy

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.800 
that is true it would be very very easy
for<00:02:22.250> spring<00:02:22.760> trap<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.120> actually<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:23.660> his

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
for spring trap to actually have his

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.750 
for spring trap to actually have his
mouth<00:02:24.020> open<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.710> lunch<00:02:25.160> short<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.490> kid

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
mouth open and lunch short a kid

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120 
mouth open and lunch short a kid
triggering<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.750> actual<00:02:27.200> spring-trap<00:02:27.830> which

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
triggering the actual spring-trap which

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.890 
triggering the actual spring-trap which
in<00:02:28.340> theory<00:02:28.580> could<00:02:28.730> easily<00:02:29.420> take<00:02:29.660> out<00:02:29.840> a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
in theory could easily take out a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.080 
in theory could easily take out a
human's<00:02:30.470> frontal<00:02:30.980> lobe<00:02:31.190> if<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:31.880> think

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
human's frontal lobe if you really think

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.930 
human's frontal lobe if you really think
about<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.440> by<00:02:33.620> combining<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.520> theory<00:02:34.910> that

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
about it so by combining the theory that

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940 
about it so by combining the theory that
spring<00:02:35.510> trap<00:02:35.750> has<00:02:35.900> been<00:02:35.930> here<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> while

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
spring trap has been here for a while

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
spring trap has been here for a while
even<00:02:37.520> before<00:02:37.700> five<00:02:38.180> nights<00:02:38.420> at<00:02:38.570> Freddy's<00:02:38.870> 2

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
even before five nights at Freddy's 2

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.480 
even before five nights at Freddy's 2
meaning<00:02:39.470> he<00:02:39.590> would<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.800> stored<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> back

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
meaning he would be stored in the back

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.040 
meaning he would be stored in the back
and<00:02:40.730> five<00:02:40.880> nights<00:02:41.120> at<00:02:41.270> Freddy's<00:02:41.540> 2<00:02:41.570> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
and five nights at Freddy's 2 and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.470 
and five nights at Freddy's 2 and
combining<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.890> theory<00:02:43.280> behind<00:02:43.430> spring<00:02:44.120> traps

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
combining the theory behind spring traps

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.230 
combining the theory behind spring traps
actual<00:02:45.080> spring-trap<00:02:45.740> with<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.370> his<00:02:46.520> mouth<00:02:46.790> we

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
actual spring-trap with in his mouth we

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.030 
actual spring-trap with in his mouth we
can<00:02:47.510> come<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.050> very<00:02:48.230> logical<00:02:48.530> theory

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
can come up with a very logical theory

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.830 
can come up with a very logical theory
in<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.310> he<00:02:49.790> could<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.240> done<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.660> bite<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
in that he could have done the bite of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.199 
in that he could have done the bite of
87<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.160> guys<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.640> all<00:02:52.730> my<00:02:52.820> theory<00:02:53.060> for

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
87 but guys that is all my theory for

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.940 
87 but guys that is all my theory for
today<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> did<00:02:54.020> enjoy<00:02:54.410> watching<00:02:54.830> then
