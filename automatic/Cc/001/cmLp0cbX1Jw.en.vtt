health<00:00:19.640> was<00:00:20.240> as<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.540> fear<00:00:21.310> everything<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.730> you

I think about public health I think

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.210 
I think about public health I think
about<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.869> importance<00:00:30.350> of<00:00:30.530> improving<00:00:30.680> the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
about the importance of improving the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.660 
about the importance of improving the
health<00:00:31.369> of<00:00:31.580> populations<00:00:32.560> what<00:00:33.560> all<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.430> do<00:00:34.640> is

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
health of populations what all we do is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.229 
health of populations what all we do is
a<00:00:34.880> society<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:35.840> can<00:00:36.140> assure<00:00:36.530> that

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
a society that can assure that

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.220 
a society that can assure that
populations<00:00:38.239> can<00:00:38.480> be<00:00:38.660> healthy<00:00:39.020> the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
populations can be healthy the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.750 
populations can be healthy the
individual<00:00:39.890> student<00:00:40.280> healthy<00:00:40.579> in

individual student healthy in
populations<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:42.079> me<00:00:42.260> what<00:00:42.470> public<00:00:42.920> health<00:00:42.950> is

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
populations to me what public health is

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.510 
populations to me what public health is
is<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.390> platform<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.500> understand<00:00:46.220> social

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
is a platform to understand social

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.549

what<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.550> interested<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.630> there's<00:00:52.590> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
what really interested me was there's an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.230 
what really interested me was there's an
how<00:00:52.890> people<00:00:53.280> interact<00:00:53.700> with<00:00:54.060> their

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
how people interact with their

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.210 
how people interact with their
environment<00:00:54.530> how<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> affects<00:00:55.950> their

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
environment how that affects their

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.660 
environment how that affects their
well-being<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:57.390> having<00:00:58.200> a<00:00:58.350> public<00:00:59.160> health<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
well-being when having a public health I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.630 
well-being when having a public health I
think<00:00:59.970> really<00:01:00.180> broadly<00:01:00.770> about<00:01:01.770> those<00:01:02.220> things

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
think really broadly about those things

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
think really broadly about those things
that<00:01:02.790> we<00:01:03.720> do<00:01:03.900> when<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.230> come<00:01:04.500> together<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that we do when we come together and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
that we do when we come together and
look<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.520> communities<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.590> always

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
look at our communities so I'm always

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700 
look at our communities so I'm always
like<00:01:07.920> public<00:01:08.310> health<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.380> one<00:01:10.380> there's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like public health because one there's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
like public health because one there's
interesting<00:01:11.250> health<00:01:11.640> problems<00:01:12.120> but<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.660> its

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
interesting health problems but to its

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
interesting health problems but to its
puzzled<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.970> think<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> me<00:01:15.300> public<00:01:15.750> health

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
puzzled I think for me public health

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.950 
puzzled I think for me public health
means<00:01:16.260> creating<00:01:17.450> healthy<00:01:18.450> supportive

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
means creating healthy supportive

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
means creating healthy supportive
environments<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> people<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.250> live<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
environments that people can live a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
environments that people can live a
healthy<00:01:21.420> life<00:01:21.660> what<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:23.010> every<00:01:23.340> day

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
healthy life what I get to do every day

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.780 
healthy life what I get to do every day

great<00:01:44.280> things<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:44.880> having<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.810> field<00:01:46.110> that's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
great things about having a field that's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.980

comes into public health the nature of
that<00:01:58.950> field<00:01:59.250> changes<00:01:59.819> just<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.810> they're

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
that field changes just because they're

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.950 
that field changes just because they're
there<00:02:01.229> with<00:02:01.710> their<00:02:01.920> personal<00:02:02.399> history<00:02:02.960> and

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it's transformative for the field I

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's transformative for the field I
think<00:02:07.170> what's<00:02:07.319> so<00:02:07.470> rewarding<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.460> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
think what's so rewarding about going to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
think what's so rewarding about going to
other<00:02:09.090> countries<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:10.020> how<00:02:10.140> appreciative
