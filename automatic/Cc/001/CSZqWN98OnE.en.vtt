00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 design today the last nonsense noon 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.269
 video on this beautiful friday 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.700
 it is slightly cloudy so the sun 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.809
 does not seem so cute now 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.040
 Nevertheless, I'm fine this week 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.719
 somehow I'm really good 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 felt and had fun 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.060
 to turn this short series 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.199
 today it's about the topic what do you do 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 on the weekend 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.599
 what does a typical weekend look like? 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 So my day my rest day is just 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.230
 so now of course I can do that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 have small pick up leisure time because today 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 is Friday afternoon around the practice 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.750
 I will not be back to me today 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.250
 clean because I have it all on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'll do it on Wednesday 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 Friday afternoon until pickup 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 somehow probably sleep like that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 somehow I'm tired and tired today 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.469
 I think I'll be easy 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.149
 rest a bit to sleep yes me 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.309
 would like to know from you what you do 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 how your day is today and if he is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 goes away party or you are always like that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 that we go every Saturday from the party 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 or 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.920
 So just write me down in 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.019
 The commentary I am pleased and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.570
 read it all through my mind 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 I got it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.330
 I think that refers to it now 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
 because you somehow mine every day 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 face have no idea what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.450
 for a powder and what blanche me 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 use that is always that at the moment 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.900
 same is why I have you 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.229
 Just brought it here as it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 I use of mimi that was yes 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.270
 at some point in the linkbox in it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.579
 we unpacked together 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's what the color looks like i did 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.460
 now dare too 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.780
 It's not that much, I think that works 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.890
 but you can see a little bit 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.750
 crossing 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 I basically do not use a make-up 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 I have been saying for the hundredth time 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.299
 and what I as a powder user either 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.210
 I have bronze or I use 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.760
 of course no meat or I have 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.940
 loose powder and then 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.460
 security and I have been now 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 longer time by castell 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.730
 Unfortunately, castell is here in 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 Germany still do not but it 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.090
 we were promised high and holy 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.170
 that it will come in here someday 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.460
 and once this is in germany 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.870
 available available further receives 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.430
 as soon as you buy it in germany 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.010
 Of course , I will be all of you 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.420
 inform and I'm an absolute 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.820
 Pastel Verein and that we always 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 is send anything from over there again 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.290
 in an order and then I want 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.550
 me someone out like epo and let 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.560
 then send me that 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.110
 yes so again back to the powder I 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.760
 Now use pastel professions like that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.900
 So look and I 'll do that to you 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.500
 this is really a great brother 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 What I like about it is just that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.180
 this powder has this special feature 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.980
 face nice to mark so not 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 if you have a face 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.000
 has something glittering and somehow lies down 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.390
 so on the facial expressions that one then 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 when it comes to light, that's it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.720
 well laminated and I like it 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040
 simply hands me completely off when 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.470
 I have a bit pale then 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 So I think my face looks 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.700
 the brother is quite good and that is 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.530
 now my absolute favorite brother 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.440
 I am a little darker and I have 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.410
 namely the 35 so I think there is 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.220
 but others leave for the dark 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.600
 Skin type, the 35 is completely sufficient 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.260
 all of them maybe now too 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.989
 turkey then you have the luck you 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.580
 to be able to buy and we here in 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.390
 Unfortunately, Germany does not have the big one 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.810
 pleasure but I press the thumb 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.180
 that it is finally here and yes that 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.440
 a little bit to see here or 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 a little bit 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.120
 swing the skids because we want 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.500
 also fits here poor as long 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.240
 should we still wait this is real 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.130
 already a year and somehow I'm annoyed 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.340
 I also wait for it for a year 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.290
 will all die and it is here yet 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.050
 Much has been said about it 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.010
 yes, we also had these times 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.570
 raffle and i believe with e book 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.220
 where we raffle the mascara 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.560
 had in different colors and the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.550
 are still totally the hit 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.560
 and loves those too 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.600
 best selling mascara stream in the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.640
 turkey because they are just so colorful 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.780
 and this immediately tip so yes me 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.160
 I would be happy if we could of course 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.900
 could get here as well 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.550
 for example, if you do that with rossmann 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.510
 Douglas could want to buy 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.120
 actually quite good too 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.620
 yes, what am I doing so tomorrow is 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.870
 a children's party there I will the whole 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.640
 spend the day at children's and sunday 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.680
 I think that is such a shield day for everyone 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.480
 So there is everyone on the couch or 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.780
 comes over me and then I go 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.570
 an ice cream parlor or drink latte 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.040
 macchiato or somehow it's sunday 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.350
 always such a day 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.669
 and mostly it is so now he will 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.380
 laugh then I'll call what are you doing 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.180
 nothing and you want to boring me 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560
 we eat something yes I have none 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.230
 Fancy eating the same thing over and over again 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.100
 our fully alone latte macchiato is 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.080
 to the ice cream shop and then she thinks about it 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.370
 first time radio silence she says no and 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.350
 then I want her too and then 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.240
 Half an hour before we want 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.380
 so go to the ice cream shop that is 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.010
 funny at first fat and were less 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.870
 unhealthy and then well , actually 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.490
 do not make it possible yes it is 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.250
 really nice if you have someone 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.630
 so you can call on call and say 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.520
 no honey they were 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.560
 I really enjoy eating that very much 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.810
 well and mostly it's either mine 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.480
 sister storyteller or I call mine 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.460
 Auntie goalie and greetings greet me 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.170
 Also here with very small ones are really 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.670
 very important for me 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.410
 a lot of time with the two and me 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.260
 We are also very grateful to you 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.240
 advised me and always stood by the side 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.370
 and i get a lot of tips like 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.440
 because they are just older 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.000
 have more life experience and i like 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.010
 Just listen , they have one 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.060
 special way somehow 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.740
 what to do 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.190
 and I just like that 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.320
 It's not like that, it's not that they have 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.360
 Just like this, they open it up 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.120
 a refined way and then 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.980
 I like to listen and then rather 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.430
 how the communities are shown to me or 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.800
 So my love for it was said here 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.930
 my sunshine so if we have that 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.640
 because it should do so or so it does 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.140
 maybe it's better and then you do it 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.110
 then also like to hear 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.570
 and that's why I spend too 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.330
 very much or very much like those times 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.980
 and then like to go with the s and 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.260
 I'll probably go this week 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.880
 finally call my aunt and 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.820
 ask how she is doing and what we do 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.650
 she will be able to do together 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.700
 I'm sure now from the weekend 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.170
 follow the past weekend 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.030
 pretty angry because I'm not 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.250
 have reported and just like that again 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.780
 Ignored everything, she thinks she has me 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.410
 called because there was a call on 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.870
 the display 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.700
 it was the series of mine is to end 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.110
 I hope you really enjoy it 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.810
 made me to see 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.390
 it's nothing important it's easy 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.430
 just a blablabla video and thank you 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.740

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.040
