of<00:00:36.780> their<00:00:37.500> preseason<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> guess<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of their preseason to I guess so it's a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
of their preseason to I guess so it's a
little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.260> advantage<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
little bit of an advantage and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
little bit of an advantage and
disadvantage<00:00:41.149> an<00:00:42.149> advantage<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
disadvantage an advantage that we get to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
disadvantage an advantage that we get to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
together of the mexico game i think they

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
together of the mexico game i think they
should<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> been<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.820> already<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:33.479> goals

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
should have been up already two goals

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
should have been up already two goals
korea<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.860> game<00:01:35.070> before<00:01:35.310> mexico<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

korea in this game before mexico is
called<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> game

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
called the first one I think that game

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069

against<00:01:38.640> Costa<00:01:39.060> Rica<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.630> watch<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
against Costa Rica if you watch it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.580 
against Costa Rica if you watch it
carefully<00:01:40.790> was<00:01:41.790> dominant<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.409> me<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
carefully was dominant we know it's me a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
carefully was dominant we know it's me a
tough<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:44.729> any<00:01:44.820> team<00:01:45.060> gets<00:01:45.299> scored

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
tough game and when any team gets scored

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
tough game and when any team gets scored
on<00:01:45.920> especially<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.280> goals<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.850> their

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
on especially for goals you know their

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.850 
on especially for goals you know their
mindset<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.439> not<00:01:49.590> let<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
mindset is going to be to not let that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
mindset is going to be to not let that
happen<00:01:50.009> again<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:50.939> they're<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
happen again so I think they're going to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.990 
happen again so I think they're going to
be<00:01:51.390> even<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.720> organized<00:01:52.200> than<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.470> were

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
be even more organized than they were

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.310 
be even more organized than they were
and<00:01:54.000> they're<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.780> coming<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and they're going to be coming out to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
and they're going to be coming out to
try<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.310> better<00:01:56.460> than<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.850> did<00:01:57.000> last

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
try and do one better than they did last

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
try and do one better than they did last
game<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.170> expect<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.009> tough<00:01:59.189> game

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
