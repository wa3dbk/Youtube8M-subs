00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:18.490
 The power was expressed at an unusual timing, hot water was expressed, and the numbers of important were flowing 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.090
 Jar that 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.810
 Because there is 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 Then I will 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.580
 Introducing Tribrid break up 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.580
 Yes Fuli Re input 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.090
 High point 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.219
 It will be a woman 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.240
 Though it's his current situation Well um 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:59.210
 Much the breaker towards that solar cell we launched now 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:02.690
 It is the place where that change appears and it is still 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.230
 Please see this screen here. 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 First of all 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:12.750
 This screen shows the consumption of wireless base station power . 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.060
 Although it is 8 here and it is written as a chapter 8 chapter 4 vision 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 This is the number of the power of soy sauce you have purchased from that Tokyo Electric Power Company's 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.220
 We cough that about 1000 from now this that 900 a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.780
 Apparently it is around 1000 w 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.990
 In in contrast normal radio stations 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.630
 It is this radio when it is that base station 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.590
 This radio is we put in here minute that are consuming you are consuming power about line Hatsu 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.560
 In now 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:47.299
 I think it has remained this will be the power consumption of the base station 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 It is the time to turn on the solar cell now 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.890
 Power generation from that corresponding battery is out 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 It's a bit unfortunate weather, so I don't generate much power, but it's here now 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.039
 I think that numbers are about 60 to 70 degrees 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.550
 This is if the weather is fine that 400 w place 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:13.360
 It speaks and is a case of that child and is 9 times 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:14.480
 It seems to be flowing into the sticky note here that what happens to 70 watts of power in 8 wards 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.959
 became 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.110
 For example because now the state by doing this is 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.890
 What 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 Power consumption of the radio power this soy sauce 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:33.330
 It is shaped to be sent by both power from the power company and solar cells 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.860
 So I'm consuming about 100 yards of chain 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:44.390
 We can see Niño is the fact that the force I mean Jaguar has decreased 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 It's like this if there is good daytime weather that day is not even 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.830
 Roughly yeah yeah 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.099
 Well depending on the station but about 40% to 80% 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.170
 If it is fine time in the daytime , then the power 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:04.650
 Can be said to come from 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:10.230
 The base station is 2 panels with 2 panels so I talk about up to 400 works at most. 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.739
 By you to do so if there is a place that is attached four all eight It is 800 bad 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.150
 about 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.590
 Politics 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.330
 The power consumption of 7 songs is about 1000 w . 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:28.980
 Well when it comes to 800 watts 8 y so 80% 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:33.060
 It is said that about 3 hours after noon replace peak power generation 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.920
 Well data is the street You know actually this is that the field trial 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:42.040
 We have to stop it is over the three years in the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.579
 Although the Tri-except for the I was or arranged eight Toka Emaa a large number of panel 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.940
 The recovery of the post is the shortest 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.360
 A Well in this 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.480
 In the form of 2 or 4 you will see 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.020
 It is a fast only a few years Well to say that a few years 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.790
 Can be recovered 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:05.950
 I think that it is completely different depending on the region of the model but it is 02 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:10.599
 Looks not that because the difference by region 8 of the company from 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:15.370
 In that trial, I did that 11 places across the country , though 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:19.579
 It is a snowy country of, for example, without surprisingly many say the difference between the amount of power generation 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.810
 I say that I think we Well snow and that snow does not generate electric power piled up 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:29.750
 There was such a concern, but if you put it in practice, it will be as soon as the weather is fine. 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:34.480
 Panel I would not like to fall in love With the snow melting, it's surprising I'm generating electricity 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:38.240
 I think the big difference was not Qi eat too much 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:43.000
 It is 拙 good boss breaker 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.100
 I think this is to be here 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.460
 Is but people here 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.950
 Even from Tribrid, from solar cells 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.360
 I will raise the flakes that come in when I really do before 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:03.710
 From the solar panels by making them inspire 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.740
 there is a life that the integrity towards the archi positions 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.800
 Four more after the day is a student 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.909
 You are here 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.909
 Birth 3 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.270
 That number is a boy by a song 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:22.240
 Matsuyo Han is a junior power source of this plastic 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.420
 Because this says TEPCO and its plan is said erotic 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.370
 Yes 1 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.050
 That water 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.050
 Oh it took with this this 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.670
 Yes 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.510
 Extracurricular activities and use the moon I also went difficulty 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.230
 I have not changed Japan 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.230
 I wonder 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.530
 me 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.530
 I am 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.590
 Reason to do it most 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.970
 It is not a reason to leave by you 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.410
 No 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.169
 I am 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.770
 Hmm 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.770
 It is everywhere, but such feeling is 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.770
 Hmm
