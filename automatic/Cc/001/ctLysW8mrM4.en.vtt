back out of the bag put them back into
this<00:03:22.259> engine<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.949> winterize<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.579> engine

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
this engine to winterize this engine

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.729 
this engine to winterize this engine
take<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.269> spark<00:03:24.959> plugs<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.229> I'm<00:03:25.379> putting<00:03:25.620> in

around<00:03:43.349> I<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:43.979> the<00:03:44.069> spark<00:03:44.340> plugs<00:03:44.609> in<00:03:44.759> here<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
around I put the spark plugs in here and

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.039 
around I put the spark plugs in here and
then<00:03:45.989> install<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.709> into<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.129> engine<00:03:48.049> what

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
then install it into the engine what

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.899 
then install it into the engine what
this<00:03:49.229> does<00:03:49.439> this<00:03:49.739> allows<00:03:50.040> me<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.340> make<00:03:50.639> sure

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
this does this allows me to make sure

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.360 
this does this allows me to make sure
and<00:03:51.209> feel<00:03:51.599> that<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.409> spark<00:03:52.709> plug<00:03:52.949> is<00:03:53.099> going

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and feel that the spark plug is going

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.559 
and feel that the spark plug is going
into<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.699> hole<00:03:53.939> without<00:03:55.879> using<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.180> spark

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
into the hole without using the spark

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.610 
into the hole without using the spark
plug<00:03:58.819> socket<00:03:59.819> itself<00:04:00.810> where<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.109> don't<00:04:01.439> have

the<00:04:01.739> feel<00:04:01.949> and<00:04:01.979> it<00:04:02.189> could<00:04:02.280> actually<00:04:02.430> end<00:04:02.729> up

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
the feel and it could actually end up

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.999 
the feel and it could actually end up
