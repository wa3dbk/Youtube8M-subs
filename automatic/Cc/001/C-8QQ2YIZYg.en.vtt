00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 And then, finally, rapaze is over. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.280
 combat was difficult 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.920
 the load was not much hit and almost died 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 the good lost mage can tolerate the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.289
 Critic cards were critical 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.439
 take one but it is now come to that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.240
 Giant luti is not a master and I leave 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 just scroll here on the quick table does not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.769
 rewarding rpg players is something 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 and such awards can come from 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.470
 numerous shapes 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 the book of verse of the 5th edition features 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.840
 different ways of creating these 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 rewards 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 one of them is you create your own 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.260
 magical items or even without speaking 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 specific items that the inpc monsters 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 using this technique can give 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 a lot of preparation work only that creates 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.210
 a coherence in fiction that looks good 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 way to see the characters do 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.899
 that luti and plunder everything of all 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.699
 mother bodies 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 there is another technique that is a bit 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.090
 more classic and can be the true 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.489
 mini event on your desk 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 the roll of rewards tables she 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.260
 has a major disadvantage the delay 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 in the resolution of the solarium closed there goes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.860
 to win one of ten thousand with parties opa 99 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 will win four more rewards 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 look only at the first reward win 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 plus two beds Monday to Monday 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.659
 it happens on the second reward you lose 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 one then that one of discreet but the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.610
 Advantage is too fucking can turn 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 absolutely anything first 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.680
 check what kind of treasure is possible 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 acquire based on the challenge round in the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.400
 level of defiance of dead creatures in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.460
 Combat ranging from 0 to 4 5 10 11 16 17 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.860
 or more in following you read if it's going to roll 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 in the individual treasury table or in the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.939
 big fucking table that first 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 wealth works for every creature 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.320
 kind of friendship is that each one received is not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 it can be presented in cash 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.939
 same or gems and art objects and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.380
 after killing the lithium of course you 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 will be rewarded with their vast 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.659
 collection of paintings and tapestries and their 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.360
 collectives by the table to take Jorge 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.190
 means a treasure trove and you 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.629
 sets the level of challenge 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.400
 following rules 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.650
 the treasury may belong to a single 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510
 monster like a dragon the leader of a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 group of monsters or the monster of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 command a dungeon a dungeon present 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 verified level of monster challenge 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.830
 fuck beauty time to start the rolls 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.200
 because there are 19 tables only of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.510
 magic items and you may have to scroll 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.129
 several times in each a good idea 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.170
 maybe it's making your players do 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.390
 the scrolls let things down 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 loaded by a master and if they come bad 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 the guilt of who all so movies 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.650
 outside the two never saw an armor 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 but 28 will file but two that you 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.959
 got a little bit of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.540
 ginger here is to close 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.290
 coritiba but if it is more interesting than 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.370
 other kinds of things rewards 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.739
 different but we are concerned that the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810
 same book gives angry alternatives 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 it is divided into several categories being 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.540
 the first of these supernatural gifts 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 there are two types of these gift the blessings 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.930
 usually granted from gods to 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 mortals who did important tasks 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 and charms that should not 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.069
 necessarily of debt 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.900
 both know good do you know both 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.519
 they grant permanent bonuses to their 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 most characters 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.209
 then come the prestigious brands 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 rewards many ways and more 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.500
 usable within fiction and they are 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.720
 separated in letters of recommendation that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.000
 can grant access to very 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.920
 or factions vital to your 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 mission medals that can achieve 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.909
 immediate recognition of practically 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.280

 lots of land and possibly 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.439
 exploding and was the character in the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.019

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.909
 to set up the little house and such favors 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.620
 that can be vital when 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.569

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.549
 places and worsening of other fortresses 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.340
