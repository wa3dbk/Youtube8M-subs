grip<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
grip just a little bit and if we take a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
grip just a little bit and if we take a
look<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> size<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.630> Petruchio<00:01:22.080> model

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
look at the size of the Petruchio model

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.789 
look at the size of the Petruchio model
the<00:01:22.619> jazz<00:01:22.860> 3<00:01:23.330> versus<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.479> normal<00:01:24.900> jazz<00:01:25.380> 3<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the jazz 3 versus a normal jazz 3 and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.800 
the jazz 3 versus a normal jazz 3 and
this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> maxscript<00:01:26.670> carbon-fibre

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this is the maxscript carbon-fibre

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.789 
this is the maxscript carbon-fibre
hopefully<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> Petruchio

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
hopefully you can see that the Petruchio

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.249 
hopefully you can see that the Petruchio
jazz<00:01:32.310> 3<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.860> slightly<00:01:34.860> larger

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
jazz 3 is actually slightly larger

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.090 
jazz 3 is actually slightly larger
hopefully<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:37.979> just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
hopefully you can see that it's just

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
hopefully you can see that it's just
slightly<00:01:38.700> larger<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.200> large<00:01:40.470> as

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
slightly larger but it's not as large as

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.910 
slightly larger but it's not as large as
a<00:01:41.600> standard<00:01:42.600> pick<00:01:43.049> size<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.680> here's<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
a standard pick size so here's a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.219 
a standard pick size so here's a
standard<00:01:44.220> pick<00:01:44.579> size<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.090> again<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
standard pick size which again is this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.569 
standard pick size which again is this
is<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.680> jester<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.220> well<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.520> just

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
is actually a jester as well it's just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.450 
is actually a jester as well it's just
the<00:01:47.790> standard<00:01:48.270> size<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.070> matched<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the standard size and if we matched it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.420 
the standard size and if we matched it
up<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.820> our<00:01:50.850> Petrucci<00:01:51.600> you'll<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
up with our Petrucci you'll see that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
up with our Petrucci you'll see that
it's<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.700> quite<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.149> large<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> standard

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's not quite as large as a standard

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's not quite as large as a standard
pick<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:57.000> larger<00:01:57.360> than<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
pick but it's a little larger than the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.490 
pick but it's a little larger than the
standard<00:01:57.990> jazz<00:01:58.610> 3<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.479> mash<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.380> all

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
standard jazz 3 so if we mash them all

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
standard jazz 3 so if we mash them all
up<00:02:01.680> together<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> see

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
up together here you can kind of see

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
up together here you can kind of see
that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.469> Petrucci<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> falls<00:02:05.790> right<00:02:06.000> in

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that the Petrucci kind of falls right in

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
that the Petrucci kind of falls right in
the<00:02:06.329> middle<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.560> standard<00:02:08.009> pick<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the middle of a standard pick and a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.470 
the middle of a standard pick and a
standard<00:02:09.810> jazz<00:02:10.200> 3<00:02:11.129> well<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.849> may<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.000> good<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
standard jazz 3 well that may be good it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.619 
standard jazz 3 well that may be good it
may<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.599> bad

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
may be bad

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.360 
may be bad
personally<00:02:14.170> I've<00:02:14.319> gotten<00:02:14.680> used<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> just

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
personally I've gotten used to just

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.369 
personally I've gotten used to just
playing<00:02:15.579> with<00:02:15.760> jazz<00:02:16.000> threes<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.629> then

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
playing with jazz threes and then

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.559 
playing with jazz threes and then
specifically<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.609> max<00:02:18.879> grip<00:02:19.239> since

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
specifically just the max grip since

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.330 
specifically just the max grip since
they<00:02:19.870> came<00:02:20.349> out<00:02:20.500> specifically<00:02:21.129> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
they came out specifically the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.280 
they came out specifically the
carbon-fiber<00:02:21.819> maxscript<00:02:22.810> because<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.230> think

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
carbon-fiber maxscript because I think

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.720 
carbon-fiber maxscript because I think
these<00:02:23.530> are<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:24.099> best<00:02:24.819> picks<00:02:25.299> ever<00:02:26.730> so

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
these are just the best picks ever so

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.170 
these are just the best picks ever so
for<00:02:27.939> my<00:02:28.060> money<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.450> still<00:02:28.959> say<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.590> dunlop<00:02:30.579> max

for my money I still say the dunlop max

you see if I try to move I move just
just<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.500> tiny<00:03:02.650> bit<00:03:02.769> however<00:03:03.069> with<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
just a little tiny bit however with the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.039 
just a little tiny bit however with the
maxscript<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.030> definitely<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.540> more<00:03:04.780> grip

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
maxscript you definitely get more grip

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.530 
maxscript you definitely get more grip
on<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.829> maxscript<00:03:06.129> I'm<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.579> moving<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.419> on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
on the maxscript I'm not moving it on

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.379 
on the maxscript I'm not moving it on
putting<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.989> great<00:03:08.409> amount<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.680> pressure<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
putting a great amount of pressure and

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.009

my<00:03:10.389> thumb<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.989> finger<00:03:11.829> are<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.659> pick

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
my thumb and finger are on that pick

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.530 
my thumb and finger are on that pick
like<00:03:14.230> they're<00:03:14.379> connected<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.459> still<00:03:16.150> prefer

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
like they're connected so I still prefer

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.580 
like they're connected so I still prefer
the<00:03:16.870> max<00:03:17.079> grip

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
the max grip

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.879 
the max grip
jazz<00:03:17.919> 3<00:03:18.310> carbon<00:03:19.239> fiber<00:03:19.479> but<00:03:20.379> some<00:03:20.680> people

jazz 3 carbon fiber but some people
don't<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.159> that<00:03:21.370> much<00:03:21.519> grip<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.060> for<00:03:22.690> them

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
don't like that much grip and for them

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.539 
don't like that much grip and for them
I'd<00:03:22.989> say<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.319> know<00:03:23.530> check<00:03:23.859> out<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.190> John

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.800 
been playing with these smaller picks
for<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.799> long<00:03:48.099> but<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.060> not<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.269> huge

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
for so long but it's not a huge

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.240 
for so long but it's not a huge
adjustment<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.409> it<00:03:50.530> would<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.799> going<00:03:51.010> back

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
adjustment like it would be going back

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.600 
adjustment like it would be going back
to<00:03:51.280> like<00:03:51.609> a<00:03:51.849> standard<00:03:52.299> size

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
to like a standard size

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.530 
to like a standard size
