00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.540
 Since the introduction of the original gameboy in 1990 ... 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.519
 Nintendo is the market leader of the portable gaming computer market that it then created itself. 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.439
 Well, Nintendo has once again succeeded in remaining the market leader with the 3DS that was introduced in 2011. 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 With the new 3DS and the new 3DS XL, Nintendo has two new versions ... 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.879
 introduced from its popular portable game console. 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.060
 It is already the fourth and fifth version of the 3DS. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.180
 And whether you are a new buyer or have one of the old versions ... 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.380
 the new one is certainly worth considering. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.900
 Just like with the old one, you can choose between the small and large ones with the new 3ds. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.080
 In terms of appearance, not much has changed. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 The small new 3DS has a somewhat larger screen compared to the old edition. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.340
 Another new feature is that you can change the appearance of your new 3DS via separately available face plates. 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.550
 Unfortunately it is only possible with the small ones. 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.790
 For me, the biggest improvement on the old 3DS is the 3D display. 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.610
 The new 3DS keeps an eye on where your head is ... 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.950
 and therefore the 3DS display will almost always work well. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.660
 You can now also play undisturbed in 3D ... 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.760
 and you will lower the slider of the 3DS strength much less quickly. 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.860
 Nintendo has put a faster processor in the new 3DS. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.800
 This makes the loading times of existing games shorter ... 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.660
 and games made specifically for the new: yes, they can contain much more details. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 In the video about the old 3DS XL I had some complaints about the lack of a second Circle Pad. 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.020
 The new 3DS does have a second stick. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.220
 But it is actually more of a pressure-sensitive little button that does not move. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.260
 The harder you push it, the faster the image moves with it. 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 It works okay, but as far as I'm concerned it's a shame ... 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 that a second Circle Path has not been chosen ... 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.090
 where you really feel something about your actions so that you can steer more precisely. 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.619
 The new 3DS also contains two extra shoulder buttons that are placed next to the standard shoulder buttons. 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.689
 You can, for example, use it to target. 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.789
 They don't seem easy to reach, but they are. 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.009
 Another point that we have mentioned in our old video is about nutrition. 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.089
 Nintendo does not deliver it with the new 3DS 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:27.289
 As a new customer you must therefore not forget to buy from 10 to 15 euros. 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.180
 Charging is impossible without it. 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.809
 So it is very awkward. I do not follow this choice of Nintendo at all. 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.489
 There would be something to be said for Nintendo using a micro USB connection 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.039
 that you see a lot on smartphones and tablets. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.060
 But Nintendo uses a unique connection that you only see on Nintendo hardware. 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.760
 Also new is support for NFC. 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.999
 This has been specially added by Nintendo so that their amiibo can be read. 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:03:01.979
 Amiibos are small toy figures based on Mario, Sonic, Zelda or other characters. 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.109
 They are very popular with collectors and with children. 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.939
 And they unlock extra things in games. 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.219
 You don't have to worry about the range of games on offer. 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.900
 The new 3DS runs all existing 3DS software ... 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.780
 and plenty of new games are coming out to look forward to. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.520
 Conclusion. 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.299
 The new 3DS has improved considerably compared to the old edition. 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.779
 Especially with regard to 3DS, there is just a difference of day and night. 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.039
 So go especially for the new edition if that is important to you. 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.549
 What is the price of the new 3DS? 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.169
 The standard edition costs around 175 euros. 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.699
 And you will find the XL edition in the store for around 200 euros. 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.159
 Well I am very curious. Suppose you already own a 3DS ... 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.859
 Would you then buy the new 3DS? 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.839
