00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
blood of deceit um I think if you kill

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.620 
blood of deceit um I think if you kill
npcs<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:03.829> might<00:01:04.100> strengthen<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.759> that's<00:01:05.360> part

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
npcs it might strengthen it that's part

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.300 
npcs it might strengthen it that's part
of<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.750> quest<00:01:06.020> where<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.290> gotta<00:01:06.440> kill<00:01:06.770> npcs

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
of the quest where you gotta kill npcs

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.499 
of the quest where you gotta kill npcs
and<00:01:07.549> there's<00:01:07.670> like<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.850> way<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.090> could<00:01:08.299> do<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
and there's like a way you could do it

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.210 
and there's like a way you could do it
where<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:08.960> kill<00:01:09.170> npcs<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:10.009> then<00:01:10.100> you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
where you just kill npcs and then you

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.680 
where you just kill npcs and then you
can<00:01:10.340> revive<00:01:10.640> them<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:11.180> keep<00:01:11.360> killing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
into oblivion but then you spawn back in

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.939 
into oblivion but then you spawn back in
here<00:05:46.729> so<00:05:47.419> nothing's<00:05:48.020> different<00:05:48.199> nothing<00:05:48.830> has

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
here so nothing's different nothing has

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.770 
here so nothing's different nothing has
been<00:05:49.190> removed<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:50.090> know<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.270> still<00:05:50.539> got<00:05:50.599> the

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
damage might vary a little bit despite

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.209 
damage might vary a little bit despite
like<00:05:59.840> one<00:06:00.110> or<00:06:00.229> two<00:06:00.259> points<00:06:00.740> something<00:06:01.069> like

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
like one or two points something like

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.320
