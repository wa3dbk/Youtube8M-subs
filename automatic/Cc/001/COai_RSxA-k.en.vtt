00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.849
 Description 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.340
 I think that this type of package is no longer attached to the filter here 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.420
 But it is not a phone, so it is not attached 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.690
 I'm going with the fact that there is no fitting for pulling out the sim tray . 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.440
 I bought that one for you 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.860

 Ahh I'm an impression 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.250

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.810
 There is also a color called black, but it looks very small, so I actually have it
