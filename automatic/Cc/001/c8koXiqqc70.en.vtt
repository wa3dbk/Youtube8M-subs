that's it for the lower you end up just
tightening<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:24.099> these<00:02:24.250> down<00:02:24.519> pretty<00:02:25.330> tight

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
and up here same thing just reinstall

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.820 
and up here same thing just reinstall
all<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> nuts<00:02:30.610> tight

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.900 

that's<00:02:37.830> pretty<00:02:38.040> much<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> front

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910

the passenger-side is an exact mirror
image<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.070> need<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.220> same<00:02:47.430> tools<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.910 
image so you just need the same tools to
keep<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.110> same<00:02:49.260> amount<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.530> time<00:02:49.710> like

keep about the same amount of time like

keep about the same amount of time like

I said before if you're gonna do
coilovers<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.650> recommend<00:02:53.160> doing<00:02:53.570> both<00:02:54.570> fronts

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
at the same exact time and what I mean

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.590 
at the same exact time and what I mean
by<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.530> remove<00:02:58.830> one<00:02:59.370> stock<00:02:59.700> shut<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
by that is remove one stock shut and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.170 
by that is remove one stock shut and
then<00:03:01.070> right<00:03:02.070> after<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.400> remove<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
then right after you remove it go to the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.520 
then right after you remove it go to the
other<00:03:03.300> side<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.660> remove<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.960> other<00:03:04.170> stock

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
other side and remove the other stock

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.320 
other side and remove the other stock
strip<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.550> leave<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> tension

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
strip this will leave all the tension

gonna<00:03:17.460> be<00:03:17.580> really<00:03:17.760> hard<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.270> that<00:03:18.300> since

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
gonna be really hard to do that since

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.590 
gonna be really hard to do that since
the<00:03:18.960> stock<00:03:19.230> strut<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:20.400> almost<00:03:21.120> twice<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
the stock strut is almost twice the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.780 
the stock strut is almost twice the
length<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.170> coil<00:03:22.440> over<00:03:22.710> so<00:03:23.550> you're<00:03:23.700> gonna

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
length of the coil over so you're gonna

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.790 
length of the coil over so you're gonna
end<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.030> having<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.330> jack<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.500> whole

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
end up having to jack up this this whole

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.220 
end up having to jack up this this whole
assembly<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:27.200> from<00:03:28.370> let's<00:03:29.370> say<00:03:29.520> down<00:03:29.910> here<00:03:30.230> all

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
assembly up from let's say down here all

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.860 
assembly up from let's say down here all
the<00:03:31.410> way<00:03:31.530> up<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.770> where<00:03:31.950> mine<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.220> right<00:03:32.580> now

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
the way up to where mine is right now

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.850 
the way up to where mine is right now
and<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.020> going<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> put<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.350> lot<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.680> tension

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and it's going to put a lot of tension

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.900 
and it's going to put a lot of tension
on<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.130> sway<00:03:35.280> bar<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.580> when<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.760> go<00:03:35.850> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
on the sway bar and when you go to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.300 
on the sway bar and when you go to
remove<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.450> other<00:03:36.630> stock<00:03:37.530> strut<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.040> put<00:03:38.220> on

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
remove the other stock strut to put on

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.650 
remove the other stock strut to put on
the<00:03:38.400> other<00:03:38.520> coil<00:03:38.790> over<00:03:39.030> you're<00:03:39.330> gonna<00:03:39.420> have<00:03:39.630> a

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the other coil over you're gonna have a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.480 
the other coil over you're gonna have a
lot<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.110> trouble<00:03:40.380> removing<00:03:40.620> these<00:03:40.950> two<00:03:41.130> bolts

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
lot of trouble removing these two bolts

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.070 
lot of trouble removing these two bolts
since<00:03:42.060> there's<00:03:42.210> a<00:03:42.270> lot<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.510> tension<00:03:42.690> holding

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
since there's a lot of tension holding

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.420 
since there's a lot of tension holding
it<00:03:43.170> up

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.280 

so<00:03:45.970> that's<00:03:46.390> one<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.689> biggest<00:03:46.989> tips<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.230> can

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
so that's one of the biggest tips I can

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.500 
so that's one of the biggest tips I can
give<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.590> guys<00:03:47.739> installing<00:03:48.340> coil<00:03:48.519> overs<00:03:48.760> do

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
give you guys installing coil overs do

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.740 
give you guys installing coil overs do
both<00:03:49.780> at<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:49.959> same<00:03:50.049> time<00:03:50.200> not<00:03:50.980> one<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:52.540> time

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
both at the same time not one one time

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.449 
both at the same time not one one time
and<00:03:52.959> then<00:03:53.079> go<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.560> others<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:53.920> install

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
and then go to the others and install

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.960 
and then go to the others and install
any<00:03:54.579> one<00:03:56.400> you're<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.579> be<00:03:57.670> removing

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
any one you're going to be removing

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.809 
any one you're going to be removing
these<00:03:58.180> two<00:03:58.239> bolts<00:03:59.099> this<00:04:00.099> is<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.280> convertible<00:04:00.640> so

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
these two bolts this is a convertible so

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.789 
these two bolts this is a convertible so
it's<00:04:00.939> a<00:04:00.970> little<00:04:01.090> bit<00:04:01.239> different<00:04:01.620> but<00:04:02.620> if<00:04:02.709> you

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
it's a little bit different but if you

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.319 
it's a little bit different but if you
have<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:02.920> coupe<00:04:03.159> or<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> hatchback<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:04.060> can<00:04:04.180> just

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
have a coupe or a hatchback you can just

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.110 
have a coupe or a hatchback you can just
do<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.480> through<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.689> trunk<00:04:05.370> one<00:04:06.370> ball<00:04:06.549> here<00:04:06.790> on

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
do it through the trunk one ball here on

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.339 
do it through the trunk one ball here on
the<00:04:07.269> convertible<00:04:07.569> is<00:04:07.750> another<00:04:08.079> on<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.319> other

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
the convertible is another on the other

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.929 
the convertible is another on the other
side<00:04:08.650> it's<00:04:08.799> pretty<00:04:08.859> simple<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.340> get<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.640> if<00:04:09.790> you

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
side it's pretty simple to get to if you

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:10.820 
side it's pretty simple to get to if you
have<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.120> hardtop

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
have a hardtop

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.240 
have a hardtop
