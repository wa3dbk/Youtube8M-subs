now we'll dust the backside with flour

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.450 
now we'll dust the backside with flour
and<00:02:22.660> on<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.840> front<00:02:24.080> side<00:02:24.290> we'll<00:02:24.680> put<00:02:24.950> some<00:02:25.160> key

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
and on the front side we'll put some key

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.220 
and on the front side we'll put some key
and<00:02:25.760> slash<00:02:26.030> oil<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:28.270> now<00:02:29.270> dust<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.900> side

and slash oil in it now dust that side

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.630 
and slash oil in it now dust that side
too<00:02:34.720> now<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:35.960> rolling<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.680> kind<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
too now we're rolling it kind of like a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
too now we're rolling it kind of like a
fan

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.880 

and<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:45.840> we're<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.170> stretch<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.620> out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and then we're going to stretch it out

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.580 
and then we're going to stretch it out
by<00:02:47.040> patting<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> counter<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.349> don't

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
by patting it on the counter you don't

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.289 
by patting it on the counter you don't
have<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.860> worry<00:02:50.069> about<00:02:50.190> whether<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.730> breaks<00:02:51.000> as

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
have to worry about whether it breaks as

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:59.750 
have to worry about whether it breaks as
it<00:02:51.420> leads<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.140> same<00:02:52.170> result<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.760> then

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
it leads to the same result and then

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.520 
it leads to the same result and then
roll<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.989> snail

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
few hours so that layers can be formed

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.949 
few hours so that layers can be formed
in<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.310> pareto<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:14.000> give<00:03:14.150> us<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.420> nice<00:03:14.569> flaky
