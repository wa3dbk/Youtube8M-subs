00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
say it now in my opinion both these

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.629 
say it now in my opinion both these
attachments<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.629> quite<00:00:48.960> underrated<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.519> the

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
attachments are quite underrated not the

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.520 
attachments are quite underrated not the
silencer<00:00:51.120> everyone<00:00:51.510> uses<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> silencer<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
silencer everyone uses the silencer but

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.989 
silencer everyone uses the silencer but
the<00:00:52.620> flash<00:00:52.859> suppressor<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.670> people

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
the flash suppressor not much people

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.759 
the flash suppressor not much people
know<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> flash

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
know about it but what the flash

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.889 
know about it but what the flash
suppressor<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.549> does<00:00:56.819> is<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
suppressor actually does is that it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599 
suppressor actually does is that it's
pretty<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.139> the<00:00:58.229> same<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> silencer

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
pretty much the same as a silencer

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
pretty much the same as a silencer
except<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.269> will<00:01:00.389> be<00:01:00.569> on<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.839> mini-map<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
except you will be on the mini-map and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
except you will be on the mini-map and
basically<00:01:02.100> both<00:01:02.429> attachments<00:01:03.179> just<00:01:03.389> get<00:01:03.569> rid

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
basically both attachments just get rid

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
basically both attachments just get rid
of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> flash<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.339> you'll<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.610> able<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.120> see

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of the flash so you'll be able to see

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000 
of the flash so you'll be able to see
your<00:01:06.540> enemies<00:01:06.960> more<00:01:07.229> clearly<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> more

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
your enemies more clearly and more

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
your enemies more clearly and more
easier<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.630> gunfights<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
easier when you're in gunfights now to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190 
easier when you're in gunfights now to
start<00:01:10.950> off<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.670> went<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> dark<00:01:12.360> map<00:01:12.899> or

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I thought this was quite a dark spot

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
I thought this was quite a dark spot
which<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.210> chasm<00:01:15.719> this<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.289> normal

use<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> silencer<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> recommend<00:02:54.209> using<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.750> for

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
use a silencer I recommend using it for

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.150 
use a silencer I recommend using it for
a<00:02:55.019> stealthy<00:02:55.380> playstyle<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.069> you're

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
a stealthy playstyle so if you're

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.320 
a stealthy playstyle so if you're
playing<00:02:56.250> search<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.700> destroy<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.239> you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
playing search and destroy it or you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.270 
playing search and destroy it or you
want<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.720> off<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.319> mini-map<00:02:58.680> altogether

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
want to be off the mini-map altogether

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.250 
want to be off the mini-map altogether
so<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> flash<00:03:00.239> suppressor<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.840> better<00:03:01.080> at

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
so the flash suppressor is better at

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.570 
so the flash suppressor is better at
long<00:03:01.410> range<00:03:01.620> engagements<00:03:01.860> where<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.549> a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
long range engagements where as a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.660 
long range engagements where as a
silencer<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.959> stay<00:03:04.230> off<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.010> mini-map<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
silencer you stay off the mini-map and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.370 
silencer you stay off the mini-map and
the<00:03:05.970> flash<00:03:06.150> suppressor<00:03:06.299> takes<00:03:06.810> less<00:03:07.019> shots<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the flash suppressor takes less shots to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.259 
the flash suppressor takes less shots to
kill<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.709> different<00:03:08.099> ranges<00:03:08.519> whereas<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
kill at different ranges whereas the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.940 
kill at different ranges whereas the
silence<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:09.989> attach<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.560> almost

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
silence that you can attach it to almost

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.280 
silence that you can attach it to almost
every<00:03:11.400> gun<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.299> flash<00:03:12.540> suppressor<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
are a visible on the map that's a bad

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
are a visible on the map that's a bad
thing<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.360> with<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> silencer<00:03:16.440> damage<00:03:16.799> is

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
thing and with the silencer damage is

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 
thing and with the silencer damage is
decreased<00:03:17.459> which<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.150> also<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> bad<00:03:18.660> thing<00:03:18.840> so

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
decreased which is also a bad thing so

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.630 
decreased which is also a bad thing so
if<00:03:19.049> you're<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.470> long<00:03:19.739> range<00:03:19.890> engagements<00:03:20.130> I'd

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
if you're in long range engagements I'd

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.460 
if you're in long range engagements I'd
stay<00:03:20.910> away<00:03:20.940> from<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.840> are<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
stay away from that if you are with a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.190 
stay away from that if you are with a
silencer<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.310> both<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.209> them<00:03:24.329> are<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.570> equal

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
silencer and both of them are on equal

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.810 
silencer and both of them are on equal
terms<00:03:25.440> because<00:03:25.859> both<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.130> them<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.579> under

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
terms because both of them are under

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.330 
terms because both of them are under
barrel<00:03:27.269> attachments<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> both<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.769> them<00:03:29.040> do

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
barrel attachments and both of them do

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.819 
barrel attachments and both of them do
remove<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.570> flash<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.200> that's<00:03:31.380> there<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
remove the flash so that's there you

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.800 
remove the flash so that's there you
