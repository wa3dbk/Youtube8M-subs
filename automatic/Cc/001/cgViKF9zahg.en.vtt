00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.970 
otherwise the more that you add the
longer<00:02:08.960> it's<00:02:09.080> gonna<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.260> for<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.680> to<00:02:09.830> melt

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:09.980 
longer it's gonna take for that to melt

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.590 
longer it's gonna take for that to melt
and<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.460> gonna<00:02:10.580> cause<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.150> cheese<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and it's gonna cause your cheese to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.730 
and it's gonna cause your cheese to
clump<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.530> while<00:02:12.800> you're<00:02:12.980> making<00:02:13.130> it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.380 

so<00:02:18.740> add<00:02:18.950> little<00:02:19.220> bits<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> time<00:02:19.790> let<00:02:20.360> it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
so add little bits at a time let it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.600 
so add little bits at a time let it
start<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> melt<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.430> add

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
start to melt down and then you can add

00:02:25.610 --> 00:03:03.160 
start to melt down and then you can add
the<00:02:25.910> additional<00:02:26.300> cheese

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.050
