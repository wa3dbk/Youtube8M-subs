lot of different parts in there but

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440 
lot of different parts in there but
there<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.350> main<00:00:46.950> subunit<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> creates

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there is one main subunit that creates

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.720 
there is one main subunit that creates
the<00:00:48.660> DNA<00:00:49.050> molecule<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.219> called<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the DNA molecule and that's called a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.130 
the DNA molecule and that's called a
nucleotide<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> DNA<00:00:53.449> molecule<00:00:54.449> inside<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
nucleotide the DNA molecule inside of a

cell exists in a twisted up form called
a<00:00:57.480> double<00:00:57.780> helix<00:00:57.960> looks<00:00:58.859> sort<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
a double helix looks sort of like this

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
a double helix looks sort of like this
well<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> could<00:01:00.690> untwist<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> molecule

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
well if I could untwist the molecule

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.920 
well if I could untwist the molecule
that's<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> screen<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.780> see

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's on the screen I would see

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
that's on the screen I would see
something<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> looks<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> ladder<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
something that looks like a ladder and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.969 
something that looks like a ladder and
if<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> looked<00:01:06.390> closely<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.500> notice<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
if I looked closely I would notice that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.960 
if I looked closely I would notice that
that<00:01:08.400> ladder<00:01:08.729> has<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.930> backbone<00:01:10.729> has<00:01:11.729> these

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that ladder has a backbone has these

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
that ladder has a backbone has these
little<00:01:12.150> things<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
little things right here this is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
little things right here this is
actually<00:01:13.650> representing<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> sugar<00:01:14.760> molecule

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
actually representing a sugar molecule

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually representing a sugar molecule
and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> four<00:01:17.009> different

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and then there's one of four different

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.990 
and then there's one of four different
colored<00:01:17.850> rungs<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.810> across<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.350> ladder

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
colored rungs that go across the ladder

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.539 
colored rungs that go across the ladder
well<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.420> subunit<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.340> something

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
well the subunit would look something

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:33.560 
well the subunit would look something
like<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:29.840> here's<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.110> subunit<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> DNA<00:01:32.570> each

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
like this here's one subunit of DNA each

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.140 
like this here's one subunit of DNA each
subunit<00:01:33.990> consists<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.280> sugar<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> case

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
subunit consists of a sugar in the case

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
subunit consists of a sugar in the case
of<00:01:36.360> DNA<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:37.100> deoxyribose<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.579> where<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of DNA it's deoxyribose that's where the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
of DNA it's deoxyribose that's where the
D<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.329> DNA<00:01:39.750> comes<00:01:40.049> from<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.610> phosphate<00:01:41.610> molecule

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
D in DNA comes from a phosphate molecule

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
D in DNA comes from a phosphate molecule
which<00:01:42.720> ends<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.049> forming<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.770> backbone<00:01:44.189> or

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
which ends up forming the backbone or

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.539 
which ends up forming the backbone or
the<00:01:44.850> sides<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> ladder<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the sides of the ladder and then one of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
the sides of the ladder and then one of
four<00:01:47.850> different<00:01:48.030> types<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> bases<00:01:49.079> could<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
four different types of bases could be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
four different types of bases could be
adenine<00:01:50.130> cytosine<00:01:50.610> guanine<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.659> thymine

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
adenine cytosine guanine or thymine

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.370 
adenine cytosine guanine or thymine
that's<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.810> base<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that's going to be the base that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
that's going to be the base that
attaches<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> rest<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.969> whole<00:01:57.270> thing

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
attaches to the rest this whole thing

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.469 
attaches to the rest this whole thing
together<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.350> called<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> nucleotide<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.729> it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
together is called a nucleotide and it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.069 
together is called a nucleotide and it's
dozens<00:02:01.140> millions<00:02:02.070> hundreds<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.299> DNA
