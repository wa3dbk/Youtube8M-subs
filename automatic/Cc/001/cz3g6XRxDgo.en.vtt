00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.590
 to make my friends hello farmer 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.210
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.769
 the big brother of the rat gesture and that we 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.019
 you presented very very recently 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 yesterday the day before yesterday before the day before yesterday I do not 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 do not know too much but in any case it was 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 very recent so from home to areas like 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 usually packaging so I spend time 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.290
 of play because I am and I go out of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.010
 after 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.860
 the helmet to introduce you to a clown 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.090
 in all black this time I I the image of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 go out at the level of the bundle that we have 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.969
 a little bit more since we are on the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.770
 high-end headphones 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 in any case more upscale than the st 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 we have a startup manual 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 fast as usual this one there is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.830
 magic matches and 7 hx since that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 there promise two little things we 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.500
 find exactly the same pair this 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.420
 microphone except the fact that the part 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.610
 lacquered black vardon lacquered appearance on 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.970
 the other is here red so a microphone 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 soft-shaped memory foam cover 3 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.170
 5 mm gold plated in the box 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.150
 we also have in the airlock and the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 user manual including 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.880
 drivers since it comes with a cd 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 of pilots what I would say test of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.950
 following the presentation then the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.909
 helmet itself 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.759
 you will see you do not have to be 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.759
 disoriented I push 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.420
 not out of place for the simple and good 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.430
 reason we are dealing with headphones 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.259
 the same look is a clown 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.259
 exactly we find the massive re-so 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.770
 with the sky the thick foam small 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 difference 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.439
 here no mesh fabric but up to and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.270
 on the inside on the settings 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.580
 always the small part that are fishing at 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.060
 my taste a little funny metal 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.000
 would have been welcome then the atrium 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.349
 massive with a nice look 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.630
 this time we are on 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.299
 softouch in any case skin coating 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.970
 soft peach hand-small 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.819
 edging which for the moment here lights up 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.069
 of red lights so the oz in red the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.730
 to men in depth on the inside 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.950
 we find the same mesh fabric with the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.220
 mito acoustic mallet red black to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.319
 inside the same thing the same thing 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.760
 on the other side here the microphone boom 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.750
 connectivity cladding for the pole 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.040
 of micro the cable arrives in a 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.530
 semi-remote control 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.780
 rectangular and the little ones we are 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.880
 will say that like that so to helpers like 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.799
 usually the little ones of saÃ´ne is 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.109
 translucent forgiveness that will give a 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.820
 little bit of color to all that one button 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.130
 to mute the volume pardon a 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.690
 button to cut micro setting from 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.760
 volume 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.799
 baho and we end up with usb gold plated 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.220
 which will plunge him into the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.400
 machine 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.230
 so this one I put them on the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.489
 ears also without the installation of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.100
 pilots 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.290
 I found on a personal basis but 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.730
 it was the concern that the sound was a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.920
 little less good than their gesture and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.870
 evo cause it does not go through the dac me 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.780
 leaves in itself no mini minihy of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.209
 matrix so that we only have 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.889
 this capture to treat lesson she 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.060
 may be of a quality a little bit 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.620
 less than dac 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 otherwise for the rest at the level of the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.780
 specialization is frankly not bad 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.310
 for having tried it quickly at 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.600
 technical data because I did 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.910
 still not the price I may not have 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.470
 still not read the cp so at the level 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.920
 technical characteristics we 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.830
 so we always have the same 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.860
 40mm speakers we have this 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.709
 once this a sensitivity to 99 baby when 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 on their age have you been at 83 me 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.580
 it seems like a head but I can say 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.069
 a stupidity or a specter covered with wine 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.780
 hertz at 20000 hertz as usual a 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.950
 weight a bit heavier since I think 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.900
 that it is posed with the remote control 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.310
 since on the weight of the headphones I 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.500
 found globally the same thing to 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.329
 a few grams close that's what about 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.280
 more than I invite you to come the author 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.220
 the come to read forgive the test written I 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.350
 am still sick on cowcotland.com 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.240
 who will appear very very very soon 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.310
 and I wish you a good day and 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.479
 I will go you will not take a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.130
 small aspirin 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.330
 here I thank you and I tell you to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.330
 very soon goodbye
