else has had that sort of issue but

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
else has had that sort of issue but
where<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> velcro<00:01:12.960> goes<00:01:13.320> around<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> seat

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
where the velcro goes around the seat

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.060 
where the velcro goes around the seat
tube<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> problem<00:01:15.950> where<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tube that's not a problem where the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
tube that's not a problem where the
velcro<00:01:17.250> goes<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> top<00:01:18.090> tube<00:01:18.439> that's<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.109 
velcro goes around the top tube that's a
problem<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> comes

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
problem because you see where it comes

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.469 
problem because you see where it comes
up<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> top<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:23.100> does<00:01:23.340> tend<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.210> catch

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
up here on the top it does tend to catch

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
up here on the top it does tend to catch
my<00:01:25.409> inside<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.460> legs<00:01:26.670> sometimes<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:29.250> only

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.299> bunch<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> times<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
want to do it like a bunch of times on a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.149 
want to do it like a bunch of times on a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
generally used bike I guess so I'll do a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
generally used bike I guess so I'll do a
little<00:01:49.829> modification<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:51.119> we'll<00:01:51.240> show<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
little modification then we'll show you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.490 
little modification then we'll show you
guys<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> minute

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500

bag<00:01:57.680> modification<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:59.280> I've<00:01:59.520> done<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> just

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
bag modification all I've done is just

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.359 
bag modification all I've done is just
sewn<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.740> hook<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> loop<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:02.610> velcro<00:02:04.369> patches

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
sewn to hook and loop or velcro patches

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.969 
sewn to hook and loop or velcro patches
I<00:02:05.700> guess<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:09.270> original<00:02:09.720> Revell<00:02:10.200> Apache<00:02:10.709> um

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
I guess on the original Revell Apache um

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.790 
I guess on the original Revell Apache um
strap

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
strap

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:22.370 
strap
so<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:12.490> got<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.930> one<00:02:14.140> underneath<00:02:14.320> here

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.250 

nothing<00:02:23.380> here<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.650> catch<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.980> little<00:02:24.130> shorts

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
nothing here to catch a little shorts

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.850 
nothing here to catch a little shorts
and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.520> back<00:02:33.670> comes<00:02:33.880> off<00:02:34.030> pretty

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and then then the back comes off pretty

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.490 
and then then the back comes off pretty
simple<00:02:35.860> way<00:02:36.310> around<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.380> something<00:02:38.380> goes

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
simple way around that something goes

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.330 
simple way around that something goes
over<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.950> one

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
over that one

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.910 
over that one
nothing<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.850> goes<00:02:40.030> over<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.420> top<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.590> back

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
nothing just goes over the top so back

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.400 
nothing just goes over the top so back
solution<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.700> mean<00:02:42.970> could<00:02:43.780> even<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.260> this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
solution I mean could even do it on this

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.290 
solution I mean could even do it on this
one<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> back<00:02:44.920> but<00:02:45.130> don't<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.970> one

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
one on the back but don't think that one

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.580 
one on the back but don't think that one
is<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.540> much<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.050> problem

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
is actually much of a problem

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.500 
is actually much of a problem
but<00:02:48.070> I've<00:02:48.580> done<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.760> before<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.360> bags

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
but I've done it before one of the bags

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.350 
but I've done it before one of the bags
and<00:02:49.720> things<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.560> improved<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> success<00:02:51.430> so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and things and so improved to success so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.670 
and things and so improved to success so
