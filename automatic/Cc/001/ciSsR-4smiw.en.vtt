00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.419
 we are here on the golf course of the country rosita 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.639
 commune 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.050
 with a character 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.050
 of the life 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.849
 social economic and political 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.069
 of the region 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.089
 with jaime 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.429
 but last night the corts 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.529
 powerful every day 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.569
 on the other hand political 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.510
 that's why our dreams 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290
 clinton is the goal league 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.630
 good question the main 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
 the first thing but we are working is to make a scaffolding 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.830
 awareness 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.900
 so that people know first what is worse 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.120
 second 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.760
 what is the relationship between tourism and life 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.300
 daily of all the people of the lagunera region 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 we are working 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.030
 first of all incapacitation 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 that each one of us is a promoter of our lagoon region 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 I think that's the most 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 nocentini goal to compete 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.740
 the national headquarters the broadest tournament members of the country 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.760
 with the mission 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.370
 to position the lagoon region as a golf destination in Mexico and 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.470
 in the world 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 and we are here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.650
 the golf course printing solutions because it comes now 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 the famous life 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 lagoon oca and nutrition vadillo 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.880
 any 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 in its fourth edition 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.570
 p what we as tourism secretariat are very interested in supporting 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.240
 master league opep as a producer 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 to destination and its lagoon 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.020
 as a civil association excessive in a point well you know 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.080
 have two very important products for us 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.660
 kessel some option 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.220
 and it's the cardenas race in the cross-country race on a bicycle 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.730
 that's why we're supporting 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.700
 logically accessions 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.610
 so this is raw 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.670
 be a heist 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.090
 he said they dissipate so that people from outside come 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.979
 to know first of all the lagunera region 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.649
 and that great attraction that we have to add four golf courses in the area 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.649
 conurbation of the lagoon 1-2 m 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:21.819
 the project 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.420
 I give you films is aimed at making movies in the region 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.060
 lagoon and in the state of coahuila with the introduction of talent management 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.329
 lagoons for the promotion of the region and the development of 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.670
 Filmmaker skills of the inhabitants of the lagoon 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.709
 cerati via twitter 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.679
 this means that it is where it is going 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.509
 Look, it's very important 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.079
 on the island retaking 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.709
 First of all, we had the talents of La Laguna as an idea 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.939
 forever 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.339
 the one that the electrodes when talking to their land and asia 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:01.419
 this event in this case cinematography when it goes to look for my peace I afa 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.599
 because he's my friend from cadet c 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.039
 lifelong 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.889
 he taught me the ishií project I understand perfectly well that what he 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:09.620
 wanted to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.609
 about his land 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.999
 the moment we present it to the governor the governor also captures 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.359
 perfectly video 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.319
 understands what he wants to do 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.689
 duck safa with earthly films 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.790
 and obviously they give a common theft an identity rollover 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.839
 the tournament is murdered exported goods by the bureaucracy first quality 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.089
 at this time and not for a budget 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.429
 percent x for a budget 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:39.829
 peek was going to be like in some commented on 16 10 games the governor absorbed 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.889
 series party 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.479
 asked that the Mexican cinema is in vogue east 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.409
 I believe that 10 of the world filmmakers 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.359
 there are two or three Mexicans here 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.769
 that we have the most difficult thing that we already had that was the talent 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.870
 because we know the pattern of each of them according to what each of them does 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.429
 they 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:56.639
 we all support 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.929
 so that four short films appear 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:02.079
 growing as an example nothing more than what can be achieved here environment 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.409
 as because the same texts 4 this land finally comes forward we will urge a 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.069
 very important project 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.579
 I grew up in a film festival in parts 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.370
 and lopez and we want later 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.829
 link the festival 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.970
 the festival there will be vines imagine that pay to place the occasion but in 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.059
 occasions and with that town that has 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.289
 but history does not 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.039
 and after working on vines we want to be extinct locations river a 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.870
 little what was ten years ago in durango remember that there was thirst for 

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.080
 filming in durán we just want to be the same as in torreón 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.550
 we want to work with certification 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.550
 so that they come to affirm from commercials that ask 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.370
 but it's free from the economic branch in the room 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.620
 there were many applications for plane tickets 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.699
 restaurants rent bodywork and one of the cribs 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.019
 I want to take the training project the pretext session 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.189
 it also influences 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.699
 train nothing the trained taxi drivers the waiters or in these 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.199
 2 times desks 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.419
 of the hotels 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.559
 balart power of power there will be everything perfect blue 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.169
 about a 2 1 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.800
 I what I think we realized when we got to Efe that I had like you 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.419
 commented on his moment 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.199
 most difficult style now is to raise awareness to all 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.550
 actors 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.610
 this half bull east sector that works tourism 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.559
 3en it is obvious that we were very supportive of the state government 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.699
 the governor elect mind because we felt it say let's start 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.650
 train 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.650
 aa2000 500 people 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.819
 that have contact with the tourist that means 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.379
 in the airlines 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.719
 at the airport the truck central 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.539
 in restaurants and hotels 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.280
 the taxi driver that is that nobody is exempt from those who already realized that it is 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.809
 a promoter the proposals that the body 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.999
 the first one asked by roberto shares with the taxi driver 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.219
 what to do here to 2015 the taxis is the political meter 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.900
 in this way whenever they presented metropolis 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.599
 Sherry to James 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.689
 thanks to that neglect this benefit is not only 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.120
 etc and packed mainly 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.979
 in three several fights first winning 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.430
 tourist culture 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.740
 the tourist culture is that it is tourism we have tourism who 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.839
 the lagoon region 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.409
 we can do tourism 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.469
 there is a representative economic spill for turret 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.659
 based on tourism 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.719
 the second is the tourist geography that we have in the lagunera region 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.610
 where are these points 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.449
 I can be these tourist attractions 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.860
 meanwhile the museums 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.480
 the golf courses are not the old buildings of the historic flat 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.659
 it accelerates the location to all the people who take pictures 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.610
 and the third is the backbone of tourism that ccm were made 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.779
 the concede actrales customer service 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.669
 yes it is one in the pleasant part the kind part 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.379
 in the face of the readers 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.490
 cotto came from outside the face that is that karate to the laguneros 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.369
 that invite you to 0 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:03.279
 that is very important for us but we are working 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.219
 it's very good that the minds in the training 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.319
 this year but not yet captured will cost more than 3 thousand 500 people including 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.849
 they fear taxi drivers and police 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.860
 photo courtesy tv 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.059
 some eyes 8 and 15 years 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:20.859
 japan hamas to disbelieve from the bbc art the interview to efe that also there the 

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:21.830
 diffusion 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.279
 the other eleven 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:28.019
 as undersecretary of tourism I do not know if I had a lot of work without this kind of 

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:29.300
 support that we have as 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.629
 like yours, the one that spreads all these things that we are doing 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.169
 of to know 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:38.860
 we are doing is very important to us because they fear 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.770
 all the other people ask 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.280
 it is questioned that what we are doing that is the most important thing 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.110
 transparency is losing 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.249
 thank you 

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.599
 how can i 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:49.530
 an interview
