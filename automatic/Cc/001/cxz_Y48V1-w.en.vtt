00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
school and and they would think it was

school and and they would think it was
really<00:00:42.270> cool<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> thought<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
really cool like I thought I was kind of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.960 
really cool like I thought I was kind of
nerdy<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.430> played<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> piano

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
nerdy just because I played the piano

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.400 
nerdy just because I played the piano
and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.809> play<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.140> them<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.320> I've

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and then I would play for them and I've

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
and then I would play for them and I've
got<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.830> positive<00:00:47.220> reinforcement<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
got all this positive reinforcement and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
got all this positive reinforcement and
it<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.150> like<00:00:48.329> that's<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> cool<00:00:48.990> I<00:00:49.050> can't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it would be like that's so cool I can't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.330 
it would be like that's so cool I can't
leave<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.650> move<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.829> fingers<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
leave you can move your fingers that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
leave you can move your fingers that
fastest<00:00:50.790> stuff<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.240> i<00:00:51.450> think<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.990> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
fastest stuff i think i think if you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
fastest stuff i think i think if you
really<00:00:52.290> give<00:00:52.470> other<00:00:53.100> kids<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:53.460> chance<00:00:53.490> to<00:00:53.910> hear

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
really give other kids a chance to hear

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180 
really give other kids a chance to hear
like<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> say<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> panel

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like what you have to say on the panel

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.190 
like what you have to say on the panel
or<00:00:56.340> whatever<00:00:56.790> instrument<00:00:57.060> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:58.020> you'll<00:00:58.140> be

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
or whatever instrument I think you'll be

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.310 
or whatever instrument I think you'll be
surprised<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:58.950> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.310> to<00:00:59.430> say

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100 

I<00:01:06.350> think<00:01:07.310> sometimes<00:01:07.490> teenage<00:01:08.180> musicians

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
I think sometimes teenage musicians

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.180 
I think sometimes teenage musicians
think<00:01:09.320> they<00:01:09.380> have<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.680> up<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.860> stage<00:01:10.040> and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
think they have to get up on stage and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.340 
think they have to get up on stage and
be<00:01:10.460> formal<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.150> stiff<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.690> do<00:01:12.229> everything

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
be formal and stiff and do everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.680 
be formal and stiff and do everything
right<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.490> people<00:01:14.150> don't<00:01:14.180> think<00:01:14.479> they're

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
right so that people don't think they're

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.240 
right so that people don't think they're
messing<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.320> etiquette<00:01:15.680> up<00:01:15.770> or<00:01:15.920> something

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
messing the etiquette up or something

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.430 
messing the etiquette up or something
but<00:01:16.700> really<00:01:16.940> just<00:01:16.970> get<00:01:17.270> up<00:01:17.390> be<00:01:17.750> yourself<00:01:18.170> be

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
but really just get up be yourself be

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:35.010 
but really just get up be yourself be
honest<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.460> think<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:20.030> know<00:01:20.060> people

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.469 

we're<00:01:35.500> told<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.859> we're<00:01:36.100> really<00:01:36.479> expressive

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
we're told that we're really expressive

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.230 
we're told that we're really expressive
of<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.719> play<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.859> think<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.520> just<00:01:39.549> comes<00:01:39.820> out<00:01:40.030> in

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
of a play I think it just comes out in

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.940 
of a play I think it just comes out in
our<00:01:40.359> bodies<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.840> everything<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.679> don't

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
our bodies and everything that I don't

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.800 
our bodies and everything that I don't
know<00:01:42.039> people<00:01:42.789> either<00:01:43.149> go<00:01:43.390> one<00:01:43.509> way<00:01:43.570> or<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
know people either go one way or the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.120 
know people either go one way or the
other<00:01:43.869> with<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.530> were<00:01:44.590> either<00:01:44.770> really

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
other with that they were either really

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.550 
other with that they were either really
like<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:45.610> they<00:01:45.700> hate<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.909> but<00:01:46.719> I<00:01:47.200> know

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
like that or they hate it but I know

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.020 
like that or they hate it but I know
when<00:01:47.799> I'm<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.100> audience<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.549> like<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.759> see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
when I'm in the audience I like to see

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.050 
when I'm in the audience I like to see
what<00:01:49.270> people<00:01:49.299> are<00:01:49.659> thinking<00:01:49.719> and<00:01:51.060> it's

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
what people are thinking and it's

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.880 
what people are thinking and it's
amplified<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.780> classical<00:01:53.200> music<00:01:53.590> all<00:01:53.710> these

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
amplified in classical music all these

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.889 
amplified in classical music all these
emotions<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.549> because<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.209> vehicle<00:01:55.719> for

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
emotions just because the vehicle for

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.050 
emotions just because the vehicle for
expression<00:01:56.469> is<00:01:56.679> so<00:01:57.100> much<00:01:57.250> more<00:01:57.280> complex<00:01:57.850> than

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
expression is so much more complex than

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.760 
expression is so much more complex than
other<00:01:58.240> types<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.630> music<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.439> you<00:01:59.500> get<00:01:59.619> more

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
other types of music so you get more

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.529 
other types of music so you get more
shades<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.310> emotion<00:02:00.819> that<00:02:00.909> you're<00:02:01.119> able<00:02:01.270> to

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
shades of emotion that you're able to

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.380 
shades of emotion that you're able to
bring<00:02:01.810> out<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:03.219> especially<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.969> don't<00:02:04.270> we

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
bring out and especially I don't we

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.520 
bring out and especially I don't we
think<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.840> piano<00:02:05.079> just<00:02:05.229> because<00:02:05.380> you'd

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
think on the piano just because you'd

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.419 
think on the piano just because you'd
speak<00:02:05.770> feel<00:02:05.950> like<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.280> full

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
speak feel like you have a full

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:20.620 
speak feel like you have a full
orchestra<00:02:06.640> under<00:02:07.360> your<00:02:07.599> fingertips
