00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 hey people and welcome to the uk project 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.080
 project plays in a city in the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.530
 seven groups secretly pulled the strings 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 pull 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.699
 the members of this grouping 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 have supernatural abilities and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 emits a power from the color of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.699
 respective grouping reflects the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 leaders are called kings and are 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.779
 especially powerful in the same city 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 the young schiri sana student lives 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 that takes life lightly and during the day 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.120
 preferably a little nap on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.719
 the guilty thing turns quickly 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.550
 the leaf 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.260
 as he is accused in one 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 to be involved in a bloody incident 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 that brings in the different kings 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 play him now on the collar want 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 he himself seems innocent 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 but there are certain things left 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 doubt and slowly turns the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 question is the referee cream a murderer 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.969
 or is it a normal one? 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.010
 students their project is tracking two 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 On the one hand, the case is about 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.199
 yoshihisa on the other hand the conflict 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 between two kings this broad leads 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.170
 to one of the biggest problems of the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.710
 Anime has because you quickly loses the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.659
 overview 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 it will quickly become very many characters 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.299
 brought into play without these 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 be properly introduced 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 I have myself with it like 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 I had to ask myself what am I looking at 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.580
 actually with the mainboard around the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 Schiri I was quite satisfied because 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.890
 this one became good in 13 episodes 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.540
 completed 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 but with the rest we are 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.100
 My taste is too many questions 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
 it just lacks 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 Background information on characters 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 the different motivation and also 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 relations among characters 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.329
 completely missing 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.610
 but the anime does a lot of things right 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.140
 technically, the anime is on a whole 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.060
 high level and just looks 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.340
 Excellent and also the characters 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 All are sympathetic over 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 if many of the background is missing 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 the story is about yoshihisa 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 exciting tent and is still small 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.780
 the plants come refreshed 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 resolution was then a bit far 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.310
 but I liked it 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.869
 it is with a second season too 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
 count on and I look forward to this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.590
 even because she can do a lot better 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.719
 and especially with the open ones 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 clean up questions 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.020
 so I do not give a project 74 out of 100 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.420
 points 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.879
 if you are a visually stunning adventure 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.620
 want to experience and gaps in the story 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.930
 and lack of backgrounds does not bother 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.890
 then you will be safe with kay project 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.890
 to get their money
