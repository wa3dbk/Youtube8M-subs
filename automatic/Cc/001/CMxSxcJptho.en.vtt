mentor you focused attention on the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.210 
mentor you focused attention on the
problem<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:24.800> severe<00:00:25.800> postpartum<00:00:26.250> flares<00:00:28.220> of

problem of severe postpartum flares of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.139 
problem of severe postpartum flares of
psoriasis<00:00:30.140> tell<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.289> about<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.679> please

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
psoriasis tell me about that please

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.520 
psoriasis tell me about that please
Bruce<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> an<00:00:33.840> issue<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
Bruce I think it is an issue that is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
Bruce I think it is an issue that is
seldom<00:00:35.010> discussed<00:00:35.820> either<00:00:36.390> by

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
seldom discussed either by

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720 
seldom discussed either by
dermatologists<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.829> their<00:00:38.040> patients<00:00:38.610> or

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
dermatologists with their patients or

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.380 
dermatologists with their patients or
even<00:00:39.059> by<00:00:39.230> OBGYNs<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
even by OBGYNs but I think it is a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.470 
even by OBGYNs but I think it is a
significant<00:00:42.390> problem<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> post<00:00:43.500> partum

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
significant problem in the post partum

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
significant problem in the post partum
lactation<00:00:45.480> period<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
lactation period and I think it's up to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
lactation period and I think it's up to
us<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.579> dermatologists<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.950> discuss<00:00:49.950> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
us as dermatologists to discuss this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
us as dermatologists to discuss this
with<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.460> females<00:00:50.910> who<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.239> pregnant<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
with our females who are pregnant that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
with our females who are pregnant that
they<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> potential<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
they have a potential to get a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
they have a potential to get a
significant<00:00:53.940> flare<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.170> question

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
significant flare and then the question

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
significant flare and then the question
obviously<00:00:55.920> becomes<00:00:56.489> what's<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> best

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
obviously becomes what's the best

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
obviously becomes what's the best
therapy<00:00:57.570> topical<00:00:58.440> therapy<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.949> possible<00:00:59.489> if

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
in breast milk and we certainly can use

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the severity of the postpartum flare but

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
the severity of the postpartum flare but
it<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.490> issue<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.240> important

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it is an issue and it's an important

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.160 
it is an issue and it's an important
issue<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.200> neglected<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.479> does<00:01:18.479> arise

in<00:01:19.680> patients<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.850> you've<00:01:21.479> managed<00:01:21.930> to

in patients that have you've managed to

maintain good control during pregnancy

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
maintain good control during pregnancy
yes<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.400> about<00:01:26.759> two-thirds<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> females

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
yes I think about two-thirds of females

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
yes I think about two-thirds of females
during<00:01:28.680> pregnancy<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.460> find<00:01:29.700> their

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
during pregnancy will find their

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
during pregnancy will find their
psoriasis<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.750> other<00:01:31.020> immune-mediated

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
psoriasis like other immune-mediated

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.249 
psoriasis like other immune-mediated
diseases<00:01:32.189> tends<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.909> spontaneously<00:01:33.750> improve

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
diseases tends to spontaneously improve

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
diseases tends to spontaneously improve
but<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> postpartum<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> frequently

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
but it's the postpartum and frequently

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
but it's the postpartum and frequently
the<00:01:36.659> immediate<00:01:37.079> postpartum<00:01:37.560> period<00:01:37.770> within<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
very inflammatory flare that he'll

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
very inflammatory flare that he'll
probably<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.160> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.550> tnf-alpha

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
probably want one of the tnf-alpha

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.570 
probably want one of the tnf-alpha
agents<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.530> rapid<00:02:01.920> action<00:02:02.100> but

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
agents that have a more rapid action but

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.310 
agents that have a more rapid action but
if<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.030> moderately<00:02:03.570> severe<00:02:03.900> one<00:02:04.140> then

if it's a moderately severe one then

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320 
if it's a moderately severe one then
I'll<00:02:04.440> choose<00:02:04.710> any<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> above<00:02:06.030> depending
