00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.829
 hello there is autumn and 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 another meaningless video video with 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120
 which I want to tell you how how 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 actually need to play tanks to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.520
 have fun and joy and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.939
 fun positive and sea sea sea 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.939
 positive emotions 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.250
 the battle begins and it seems that now 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.000
 now everything will happen 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.000
 tank leopard 1 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:43.330
 excellent armor as for me 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.880
 268 on the head and a lot of 330 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.820
 everything can get up shoot all that 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.480
 wants and now itâ€™s about 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.989
 how the pumping station 10 manage to play 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 like this 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.660
 call this video shoot like a deer and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.720
 so it would seem 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.580
 paradoxically a deer shoots what is it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.009
 maybe but it really is 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.840
 knees in this case it's me shooting 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:13.360
 Well, I know that someone shoots 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.540
 avtopotsel and someone does not know where 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.060
 shoot even finish the game like i'm sitting like 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.479
 implied that I know it sometimes 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.310
 There are such battles in which 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.060
 least it gets scary for so 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.630
 how am I how do I do fire training 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 Nathan 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 it's creepy 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.680
 participate than I talked about remembering 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.680
 this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.289
 replays helped me video gas a 13 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.549
 who came back seagull remember this he 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.340
 come back again machines 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:58.170
 Well, more precisely to their days in their tank 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 now begin why else it becomes 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.079
 and that is 4 to 4 who were trained in 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:09.000
 Gia tower is not just can not come up with 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:13.920
 video video looked then he talked about 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 ricochets and no penetrations I think to take something 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.620
 I have to wake up like you in 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 which i enjoy first 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 I will almost stop clamping 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:37.270
 away 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:39.850
 oh how I killed the land on why for what 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.280
 in vain you become explanatory 2 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.940
 why this shot is needed yes you are not 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.770
 never go through it in my life 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.990
 disabled comment on youtube that is 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.060
 can argue with him three 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.400
 impossible damn shoot stable 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.240
 on his tower and try to hope for it 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.580
 that you will be able to break through but where where that 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.250
 it's 4 where are you shooting 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.340
 This rarity on idiocy simply 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.099
 rare debilizm therefore 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 guys well if you see such a game 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.280
 although you can see some person 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 well let's do it right again 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.340
 what do we need to shoot more 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.739
 spend all the shells damn and after that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.290
 someone will say thin is not the account 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.870
 certainly not accuracy and punch died not 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.230
 know how to punch put yourself skins 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.469
 where did she hope you steel something 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:46.900
 wall doing 4 incomprehensibly incomprehensible 10 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:48.879
 generally honestly a57 while employees we 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 continue to drag that already had a video with 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:57.730
 they are here not dragged or not the drag 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.189
 briskly once someone of them was dragging and someone 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.840
 no, but now I think everything is well 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.230
 shitty position played now I'm 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.439
 I can go and basically 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.049
 shoot off 50b 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:14.079
 after eight one super super here i 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.639
 I enjoyed the game very much 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:21.780
 finally finally 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:24.610
 but the gas that's 13 said that 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.289
 enjoy how to get 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.500
 pleasure hear set ricochet not 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.229
 I'll go like you know she moves the body 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.880
 further and further trying to shoot 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.610
 these what and where not 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.920
 need there is no purpose motivates you 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.260
 try to pierce try to pierce and all 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.570
 the battle you kill for somehow 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 be able to punch naturally video 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:53.450
 meaningless but I want to ask you about 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.420
 tom so you really so you 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.520
 really learned to punch tanks 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.800
 especially show everyone who is looking for a game 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.780
 few fights not watched videos are watching 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.170
 some poleshek there with meaningless 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.350
 themed yes how would damn but having a gun 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.360
 even with a break through aktobe 68 yes yes or 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.730
 even more 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.270
 it does not guarantee anything a number 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.670
 I am playing on the test server on a wafer 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.590
 there is no guarantee of gold here 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.380
 punch on all one hundred percent of this 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.330
 No, therefore, try not to learn 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.330
 such a meaningless shot especially 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.360
 tank on which little ammunition is the same 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.480
 the most but something like that later 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.670
 it might play a bad joke for you 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.390
 yes well with you was the axis I will thank you all 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.390
 bye everyone
