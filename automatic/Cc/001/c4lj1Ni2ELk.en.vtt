with<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.569> semen<00:02:13.209> now<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.540> we're<00:02:14.840> doing<00:02:14.900> that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
with the semen now as we're doing that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.309 
with the semen now as we're doing that
you<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.620> head<00:02:15.770> now<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.580> Semin<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.319> actually

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
you can head now the Semin I actually

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.809 
you can head now the Semin I actually
like<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.800> keep<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:20.480> big<00:02:20.959> chunks<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.819> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
like to keep it in big chunks and the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.180 
like to keep it in big chunks and the
reason<00:02:23.120> why<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> say<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:24.260> it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
reason why I say that is because it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.630 
reason why I say that is because it
creates<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.850> stronger<00:02:26.300> flavor<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.200> doesn't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
creates a stronger flavor and it doesn't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:45.430 
creates a stronger flavor and it doesn't
melt<00:02:28.870> too<00:02:29.870> quick
