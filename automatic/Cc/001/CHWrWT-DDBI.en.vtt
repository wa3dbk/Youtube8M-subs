00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.770 
a different scenario this time the gate
already<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:37.049> down<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.879> Geats<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:39.359> at<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
already is down so the Geats down at the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.539 
already is down so the Geats down at the
bus<00:02:41.420> wants<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.569> get<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:43.500> anyway<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.189> it<00:02:44.310> kind

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
bus wants to get going anyway so it kind

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.399 
bus wants to get going anyway so it kind
of<00:02:44.609> comes<00:02:44.849> around<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.540> then<00:02:45.750> goes<00:02:46.019> around<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
of comes around and then goes around the

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.470 
of comes around and then goes around the
gates<00:02:46.650> we're<00:02:46.829> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.310> stuck<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.389> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
gates we're going to just stuck on the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:03:03.010 
gates we're going to just stuck on the
tracks<00:02:48.689> so<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:50.159> we<00:02:50.189> go<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.609> comes<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.909> train

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:13.240 

you

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.190 

yeah<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.540> didn't<00:03:15.810> really<00:03:15.989> go<00:03:16.170> well

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
yeah so that didn't really go well

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.740 
yeah so that didn't really go well
lookie<00:03:16.829> tercel<00:03:17.250> gum<00:03:17.430> which<00:03:18.000> cuz<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.359> names<00:03:18.569> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
lookie tercel gum which cuz it names the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.509 
lookie tercel gum which cuz it names the
gate<00:03:19.019> when<00:03:19.230> he<00:03:19.319> hit<00:03:19.469> the<00:03:19.500> boss<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:20.159> damaged<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
gate when he hit the boss it damaged the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.210 
gate when he hit the boss it damaged the
gate<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> stayed<00:03:21.359> down<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.620> boss<00:03:22.829> got

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
gate so it stayed down and the boss got

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240 
gate so it stayed down and the boss got
Brad<00:03:23.640> dragged<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.689> dragged<00:03:25.019> got<00:03:25.709> dragged<00:03:26.040> all

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
Brad dragged and dragged got dragged all

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.690 
Brad dragged and dragged got dragged all
the<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.519> from<00:03:26.579> over<00:03:26.819> there<00:03:27.120> down<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.700> right

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
the way from over there down to right

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.319 
the way from over there down to right
over<00:03:30.060> here<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.750> he<00:03:31.530> flipped<00:03:31.799> over<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.430> not

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
over here and he flipped over so not

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.849 
over here and he flipped over so not
going<00:03:33.540> around<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> little<00:03:34.049> gates<00:03:34.530> she<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:36.859> do

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
going around the little gates she not do

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.670 
going around the little gates she not do
stop<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.030> look<00:03:39.150> both<00:03:39.389> ways<00:03:39.420> if<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.470> don't

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
stop and look both ways if you don't

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.500 
stop and look both ways if you don't
back<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:40.889> end<00:03:41.159> up<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.730> hood<00:03:41.939> side<00:03:42.209> job

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
back it end up like the hood side job

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.289 
back it end up like the hood side job
and<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.620> hope<00:03:43.919> you<00:03:44.099> learned<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.519> lot<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.909> enjoyed
