00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.940
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.789
 kriga tv and today we talk about such 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.590
 great car like bmp-1 it is with us 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 third level armored combat 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.660
 car, well, let's get started 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.030
 I would like to immediately say that this fight 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.519
 will not be some kind of mega puzzler but the end 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.129
 it will be generally epic but 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.589
 besides wins you need to show probably and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.170
 some kind of defeat, I am nothing against 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.330
 i dont have it i'm not ashamed of how i 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 I play therefore we actually watch 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.070
 well and in order not to pull let's 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 talk a little about the car and then 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.229
 if we have time we will move on to the fight even though you 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.080
 so must see him so bmp-1 third 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.930
 armored combat vehicle level what 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.760
 I like it in it of course cannon well 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.549
 rather here I have something like that too 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.829
 one sided impression 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.469
 we are gorgeous alpha almost like u 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.890
 Patton and Patton I recall it all the same 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.009
 oh b oh not o bts t oh no matter everything here 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 oh b so this is 62 for me lunch and in 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.640
 In general, we have one-time damage very serious 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.200
 almost 260 units of strength we remove for 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.969
 a shot is a lot 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.429
 it's great with us pretty 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.859
 fast recharge about 7 seconds 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.990
 quickly it is very fast and in doing so 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.759
 cumulative we have more or less 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.780
 normally punch but firstly it 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.539
 cumulative 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.030
 and secondly penetration there is not even 200 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.799
 that is, there are about 180 as I remember 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 170 180 is not that small but sometimes 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.929
 and bt it will be difficult to punch again. 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.819
 remind me that experience and all tanks 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.950
 which are indicated by this class in the game 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.319
 don't scold me for it and so 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.899
 returning to the gun tool 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.210
 wonderful but sometimes there are incidents 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.300
 that through the tracks you can't pierce 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.970
 shells are mowing down the cannon 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.069
 pretty oblique though seemingly 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.040
 exactly and how do you start shooting 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.170
 get some incidents permanent well 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.900
 and in general sometimes get real 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.020
 difficult and can when bake personally with me 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.870
 never hot but sometimes can 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.209
 really beat a little nerves and so 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.660
 returning to the car we can punch 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 let's say the same t-62 in the forehead though here in 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.910
 upper frontal detail hardly in the turret 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.250
 making your way is not always necessary to target 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.590
 but you can get straight into 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.080
 the forehead of the tower and not your bar 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 break through the towers oddly enough and we can 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 punch him in the lower armor 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.050
 and it is quite a normal result 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.510
 here again the main get 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.430
 returning to some other machines too 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.650
 armored fighting we punch them 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
 easy at ease and pretty good 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.060
 we take away the only thing that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.489
 25 or twenty 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.340
 millimeter guns do not get out exactly 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.160
 is it worth us still backfire very strongly 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.680
 so if you really want it to do some shooting 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.989
 use your not bad review he and 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.549
 the truth here is normal of course we are not 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.310
 as small as the same 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.489
 scorpion and visibility is higher than that of 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.040
 some small cars but usually the same 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.260
 t-62 or patina we see easily 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.940
 at the same time they do not see us 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.480
 even after we start on them 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.030
 shoot 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.430
 which I think is a pretty good plus 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.560
 still we are such semi intelligence and we 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.630
 may well devote ourselves to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.820
 This do not light up and try 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.190
 someone sda distribute and this I think 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.280
 very nice booking 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.040
 but better not to mention this indicator 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560
 as it is clear there is absolutely no 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.239
 and everyone will always punch us and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.160
 in general, in any case 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.720
 I don't even know whether to hope for 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.760
 some kind of non-penetration and bounce from 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.859
 there is no twenty millimeter 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.620
 began to hope for it and do not advise you in 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.720
 general, the main thing is not to be substituted and and that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.940
 we can do it right we 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.489
 we can run away from the enemy speed 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.079
 we are a great car tearing just with 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.750
 places in the quarry because along the way 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.210
 horses under the hood hidden a lot yes 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.460
 Maxim Allochka 53 kilometers per hour but 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.710
 this does not prevent us from flying around the map 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.320
 that's it because the dynamics are just 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.150
 tin and if with the turn here everything is not 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.669
 so rosy turn in principle 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.979
 not bad then backward accelerates 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.289
 car just a few seconds it 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.210
 great feeling like 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.880
 any Arabian horse vs 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.159
 foot warrior in general armor here 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.440
 Of course everything is bad, but in terms of speed and 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.159
 keeping the enemy all pretty 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 not bad 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.690
 and I didnâ€™t have enough time to fight 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.419
 tell but in the end everything was delayed 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.729
 I think that the car bmp cabinet 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.760
 wonderful unit of course it is not 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.070
 I know not t-62 and the tactic is different here 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.140
 but believe you enjoy the game 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.240
 get no less well and actually what I 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.669
 I'm trying to get away from opponents 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.979
 neat them this whole fight shot 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.930
 even punched and inflicted damage on me 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.690
 baited an ally in general 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.669
 immediately here and slammed oh well 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.050
 you had a loan or who liked the fight 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.510
 put your thumbs up 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.780
 subscribe to the channel see you bye 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.780
 until
