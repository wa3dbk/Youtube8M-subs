 Today's video will be told about the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.320
 stadium out of ultimate team mode 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.300
 because then you should buy a stadium 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 rare gold that is much more expensive than 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.669
 one of bronze that changes something a 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.650
 stage influences the gameplay that 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.280
 I'll tell you what influences the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.750
 is mainly the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.870
 The first thing you will notice is 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.810
 amoral're the bronze stage is it you 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.700
 gives only four more morale and is going 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.220
 rising as a consequence of bronze 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.260
 radio of the five of today's moral dish 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
 moral science also today rare silver 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.790
 moral headquarters or the normal of gold 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.490
 six of moral and rare gold gives support of 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.550
 morale influences in its 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.380
 game teaches morale is practically it 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.360
 sends chemical and nexus 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.890
 and now in this section 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.530
 called interlocking 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.189
 they are practically sisters. 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.719
 happens 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.329
 you can have a team with 100 of 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.299
 right there, with as much as he 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.950
 it's still going to play pretty normal in the day 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.810
 What are you going to say you want? 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.240
 run such kind of thing but if you 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.700
 have low morale he will not do the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.369
 What more do you expect from it? 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.960
 understood is the player's morale is is how 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.299
 It would in real life is the same for 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.939
 example white passed and now a while 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.679
 behind and Basque is owing money 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.659
 that your players is not what happens 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.249
 the moral of the players falls snow that putin 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.420
 is not paying the team is not 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.639
 investing in them, huh? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.520
 so it seems the player does not stay 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.560
 motivated to play and this happens 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.990
 same thing on fifa.com trunk on morale 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.369
 from the bottom is missing the match very 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.740
 player is long in the bank 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.319
 moral reserve of it falls right 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.229
 already this morale of the stadium there is always a 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.999
 boost for your team so it does not change 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.609
 if you have a stadium for example it is 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.289
 of bronze with four more of moral 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.569
 You'll always have this four more 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.729
 moral already the rare gold you will always have 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.349
 this eight coral that counts as 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.810
 if it was the crowd it 's how much the fans 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.810
 of that stadium will influence your 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.700
 time account will motivate your team 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.770
 koné so this is much better are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.510
 the stadium of golden haruna that always goes 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.060
 It gives you eight more morals than one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.900
 Bronze stage and just go more 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.489
 four 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.220
 another important factor is that you 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.380
 need to note about the stadiums 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.950
 It's the weather in the guy I want. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.250
 tell it's just the rain and snow it 's the three 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 cousins there that have in fifa this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.050
 Influence the gameplay a lot in Coroatá 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.790
 shower or carrying the ball usually 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.069
 she gets stuck at night plus one 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 most fulfilled release is over 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.790
 this week the release over 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.069
 ball has day here and run more right 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 so it 's harder to master them 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.610
 have to make the passes through the top 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.590
 I can not be here in the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.910
 release the empty space that the player 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.739
 run there 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.420
 generally the ball will leave the field if 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.459
 you do it right already when you touch 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.620
 on the ground the ball tends to run - on it 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.420
 going to start at very fast speed 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.459
 only that for much faster is for 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.400
 cause of friction it will get bigger there 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.209
 as ground right was a more slowdown 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 fast 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.609
 sure but how do I know what the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.670
 stadium has is this climate is with the stadium 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.920
 actually have snow and rain is this 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.420
 Kind of thing is easy you go there in the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.880
 kick is as if it were a 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.650
 fifa friendly that you can in there 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.840
 game options you can see all the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.109
 that you have and can check if they 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.920
 they have rains they in snow this kind of 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.109
 thing there is standard is having a child already there 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.150
 from the initial mode you can choose and see 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.360
 which the stadium is the best for you 47 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.580
 more cool 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.800

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.230
