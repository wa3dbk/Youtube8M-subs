00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
Cameron I mean he's a formidable fighter

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.320 
Cameron I mean he's a formidable fighter
he's<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.849> know<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:19.330> great

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
he's a you know a really you know great

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.680 
he's a you know a really you know great
fighter<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.980> ring<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.400> know<00:02:25.690> style

makes<00:02:26.900> fight<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:29.620> guess<00:02:30.970> Cameron<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:33.110> his

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.530 
makes fight and I guess Cameron for his
style<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.950> which<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.819> course<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.240> not<00:02:35.390> gonna

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
style but which of course it's not gonna

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.450
