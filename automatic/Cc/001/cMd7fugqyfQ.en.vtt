00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 but you have to take advantage of any 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 opportunity and since this year I have 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.449
 retired the world of high competition 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 I left professional athletics 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.019
 through a friend and I came up with the idea 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 hey you want to take your time 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.829
 you can really help out and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 learn profession and working that is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 the thing very bad and then good I that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.059
 I am a guy thrown forward and I have 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.589
 family I have three children so they have 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.239
 given an opportunity in an environment 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.309
 nice is working well many 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.409
 standing but well I think that one 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 it has to serve for everything and of course 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.379
 I hope to do it well so I can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 To follow much a long time here as 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.840
 propose a life without having to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 get up to run sacrifice good 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.350
 because now thinking that I have is much 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.240
 standing time that I have to be many 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 hours working in front of people and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600
 good and then later I have a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.710
 little hole, yes, I would like 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.210
