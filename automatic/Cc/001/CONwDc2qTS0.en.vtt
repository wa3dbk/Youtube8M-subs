across the states these past months so I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
are for a different kind of politics so
I<00:00:36.809> spent<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.320> thinking<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.010 
I spent some time thinking about how I
could<00:00:38.550> best<00:00:38.760> advance<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.420> cause<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.629> change

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
could best advance the cause of change

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.280 
could best advance the cause of change
in<00:00:40.260> progress<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.430> desperately<00:00:41.879> need
