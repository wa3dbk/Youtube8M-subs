in the future now anything's possible in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
in the future now anything's possible in
it<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> change<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> lot

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it then I actually kind of change a lot

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
it then I actually kind of change a lot
and<00:00:49.140> personally<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.739> too<00:00:50.219> sure<00:00:50.399> about

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and personally I'm not too sure about

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
and personally I'm not too sure about
that<00:00:50.700> i'm<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:50.879> sure<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> greatest

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that i'm not sure if that's the greatest

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
that i'm not sure if that's the greatest
idea<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.260> basically<00:00:52.500> i<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
idea because basically i think one of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.319 
idea because basically i think one of
the<00:00:53.160> reasons<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> college<00:00:53.820> success<00:00:53.940> was

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the reasons that college success was

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
the reasons that college success was
kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.620> bit

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
kind of because it's a little bit

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.810 
kind of because it's a little bit
similar<00:00:55.920> every<00:00:56.219> year<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
similar every year you know I know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.250 
similar every year you know I know
people<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> change<00:00:57.809> things<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
people so you got to change things and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.720 
people so you got to change things and
looks<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:58.949> changed<00:00:59.370> things<00:00:59.489> but

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
looks like they have changed things but

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
looks like they have changed things but
you<00:00:59.820> still<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.539> can't<00:01:00.719> change<00:01:00.899> too<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you still you can't change too much and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
you still you can't change too much and
make<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> feel<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.879> Call<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> Duty<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
make it feel not like Call of Duty so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.179 
make it feel not like Call of Duty so
that's<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.260> take<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:04.890> thing<00:01:05.040> I'm

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

actually<00:01:06.600> surfaced<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.770> mid<00:01:08.040> April<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
actually surfaced in about mid April and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
actually surfaced in about mid April and
that<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.750> before<00:01:10.320> anything<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that way way before anything is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.840 
that way way before anything is
finalized<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.700> especially

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
finalized you know especially

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
finalized you know especially
multiplayer<00:01:12.570> they're<00:01:13.049> still<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
multiplayer they're still really kind of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.530 
multiplayer they're still really kind of
fine-tuning<00:01:14.460> multiplayer<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
fine-tuning multiplayer right now and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.760 
fine-tuning multiplayer right now and
lots<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> things<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.170> subject<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
lots of things are actually subject to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
lots of things are actually subject to
change<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.670> image<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.180> right<00:01:18.360> here

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
change so this image we see right here

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.730 
change so this image we see right here
is<00:01:18.659> probably<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.439> different

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
is probably going to be very different

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
is probably going to be very different
to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> image<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.640> find<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> see
