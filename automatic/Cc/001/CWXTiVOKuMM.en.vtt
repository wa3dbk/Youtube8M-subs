00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
it this thing comes snap just like that

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.600 
it this thing comes snap just like that
little<00:01:49.119> plastic<00:01:49.479> case<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.369> take<00:01:51.490> it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
little plastic case you have to take it

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.399 
little plastic case you have to take it
out<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.850> case<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.090> use<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.570> because<00:01:52.840> the
