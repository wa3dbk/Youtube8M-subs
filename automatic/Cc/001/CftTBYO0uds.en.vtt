00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
abrupt move today we we got

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
watch our reaction to anger we got to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.430 
watch our reaction to anger we got to
make<00:02:12.879> sure<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.209> we're<00:02:13.599> learning<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.170> react

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
make sure that we're learning to react

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.229 
make sure that we're learning to react
differently<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> things<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.430> get<00:02:15.909> out<00:02:15.940> of

these patterns in these parts of

these patterns in these parts of
ourselves<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.510> we<00:02:28.720> hold<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.790> know

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
ourselves that we hold so you know

go of or we're trying to control this is
forcing<00:02:38.379> us<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.560> try<00:02:38.890> different<00:02:38.950> ways

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
forcing us to try different ways

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.850 
forcing us to try different ways
different<00:02:40.239> reactions<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.319> lot<00:02:41.590> being

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
different reactions and with a lot being

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440 
different reactions and with a lot being
uncovered<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.640> maybe<00:02:42.819> not<00:02:43.060> paying<00:02:43.329> attention

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
uncovered and maybe not paying attention

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.960 
uncovered and maybe not paying attention
to<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> brighter<00:02:44.230> picture<00:02:44.500> today<00:02:44.859> or<00:02:45.280> what

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
to the brighter picture today or what

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.180 
to the brighter picture today or what
really<00:02:46.299> makes<00:02:46.510> something<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.140> more<00:02:47.410> happy

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
really makes something a more happy

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.180 
really makes something a more happy
picture<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:50.170> moon<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.590> Scorpio<00:02:51.010> is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
picture this moon in Scorpio is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.630 
picture this moon in Scorpio is
triggering<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.849> lot<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.400> definitely

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
triggering a lot and this is definitely

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.899 
triggering a lot and this is definitely
a<00:02:54.940> day<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> make<00:02:55.420> sure<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.310> try<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> new

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
a day to make sure that you try a new

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.720 
a day to make sure that you try a new
way<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.180> react<00:02:58.599> this<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.739> also<00:03:00.010> i<00:03:00.190> think<00:03:00.310> so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
way to react this is also i think so

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.000 
way to react this is also i think so
important<00:03:01.269> because<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.680> mercury

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
important because we do have mercury

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.710 
important because we do have mercury
finishing<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.909> here<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.359> out<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.540> a

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
finishing up here and it's out of a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.080 
finishing up here and it's out of a
shadow<00:03:05.019> period<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.819> we<00:03:06.970> are

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
shadow period right and so we are

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.020 
shadow period right and so we are
getting<00:03:07.359> coming<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> lot<00:03:08.379> of<00:03:08.409> new

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
getting coming with a lot of new

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.970 
getting coming with a lot of new
epiphanies<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.269> understandings<00:03:10.989> about<00:03:11.170> what

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
epiphanies and understandings about what

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.589 
epiphanies and understandings about what
we<00:03:12.099> want<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:12.489> our<00:03:12.579> life<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.090> how<00:03:13.269> we're<00:03:13.510> going

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
we want in our life and how we're going

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.690 
we want in our life and how we're going
to<00:03:13.659> connect<00:03:14.049> all<00:03:14.230> these<00:03:14.440> things<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.010> i<00:03:15.400> think

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
to connect all these things and i think

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000 
to connect all these things and i think
this<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:15.970> about<00:03:16.209> being<00:03:16.569> smart<00:03:16.930> i<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:17.859> that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
this is about being smart i think that

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.120 
this is about being smart i think that
this<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.190> about<00:03:18.459> really<00:03:19.359> looking<00:03:20.139> at<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.500> from

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
this is about really looking at it from

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.599 
this is about really looking at it from
a<00:03:21.340> whole<00:03:22.120> satellite<00:03:22.870> view<00:03:23.500> before<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.280> jump

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
a whole satellite view before we jump

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.159 
a whole satellite view before we jump
and<00:03:26.340> having<00:03:27.340> an<00:03:27.430> inner<00:03:27.579> faith<00:03:27.910> in<00:03:28.750> our

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
and having an inner faith in our

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.150 
and having an inner faith in our
intuition<00:03:29.829> but<00:03:30.340> about<00:03:30.730> how<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.209> go<00:03:31.510> about<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
intuition but about how we go about it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.670 
intuition but about how we go about it
instead<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.370> kind<00:03:33.609> of<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.419> know<00:03:34.450> i<00:03:34.810> feel<00:03:35.470> this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
instead of kind of you know i feel this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.229 
instead of kind of you know i feel this
i<00:03:35.889> know<00:03:35.950> this<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.220> happening<00:03:36.459> oh<00:03:36.819> my<00:03:36.940> god<00:03:37.090> and

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
i know this is happening oh my god and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.490 
i know this is happening oh my god and
i'm<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.419> going<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.629> do<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.900> way<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.169> i<00:03:38.200> want

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
i'm just going to do the way that i want

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.839 
i'm just going to do the way that i want
to<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.919> way<00:03:39.040> you've<00:03:39.220> always<00:03:39.400> done<00:03:39.699> it

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
to or the way you've always done it

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.420 
to or the way you've always done it
before<00:03:40.349> maybe<00:03:41.349> there's<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> route<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.250> you're

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
before maybe there's a route that you're

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.550 
before maybe there's a route that you're
not<00:03:42.669> paying<00:03:43.000> attention<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.019> today<00:03:44.319> that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
not paying attention to it to today that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.770 
not paying attention to it to today that
you<00:03:44.650> need<00:03:44.919> to<00:03:45.069> see<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.579> that<00:03:45.910> usually<00:03:46.209> comes

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
you need to see and that usually comes

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.990 
you need to see and that usually comes
with<00:03:46.870> i<00:03:47.199> don't<00:03:47.590> want<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.799> say<00:03:48.000> disconnection

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
with i don't want to say disconnection

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030 
with i don't want to say disconnection
but<00:03:49.510> i<00:03:49.540> want<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.930> say<00:03:50.139> that<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.500> comes<00:03:50.739> through

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
but i want to say that it comes through

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.089 
but i want to say that it comes through
being<00:03:51.310> more<00:03:52.209> aware<00:03:52.530> making<00:03:53.530> sure<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.889> maybe

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
being more aware making sure that maybe

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.409 
being more aware making sure that maybe
you<00:03:54.310> do<00:03:54.519> something<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.970> haven't<00:03:55.090> done<00:03:55.209> before

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
you do something you haven't done before

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.180 
you do something you haven't done before
so<00:03:55.959> if<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.139> really<00:03:56.379> want<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.590> react<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:56.919> do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so if you really want to react to do

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.439
