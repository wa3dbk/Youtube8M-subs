DC tried they just couldn't make a
profit<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.610> eventually<00:01:14.820> time<00:01:15.299> worn<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.750> went

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
profit so eventually time worn out went

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
profit so eventually time worn out went
to<00:01:16.140> marvel<00:01:16.530> comics<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.130> basically<00:01:17.759> said<00:01:18.030> hey

Marvel you want to buy DC Comics and
this<00:01:22.170> never<00:01:22.770> happened<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> end<00:01:23.939> DC<00:01:24.780> was

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this never happened in the end DC was

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.929 
this never happened in the end DC was
able<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> try<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.770> create<00:01:25.920> some<00:01:26.220> events<00:01:26.700> try

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
able to try and create some events try

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
able to try and create some events try
some<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.600> new<00:01:27.869> things<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.710> were

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
some very very new things and they were

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
some very very new things and they were
able<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.369> gain<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> profit<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
able to gain a profit but the thing is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
able to gain a profit but the thing is
we<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.729> direction<00:01:32.790> once

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
we are going in that direction once

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
we are going in that direction once
again<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> DC<00:01:34.860> needs<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> pull<00:01:35.460> something<00:01:35.729> out

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
again so DC needs to pull something out

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
again so DC needs to pull something out
of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> hat<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.750> try<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> gain<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> profit<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of the hat to try and gain a profit a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
of the hat to try and gain a profit a
whole<00:01:38.700> list<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.240> things<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.600> gone<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.900> here

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
whole list of things has gone on here

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
whole list of things has gone on here
first<00:01:40.409> off<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> need<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.159> into<00:01:41.369> account

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
first off you need to take into account

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.410 
first off you need to take into account
that<00:01:41.759> DC<00:01:42.150> has<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:43.140> moved<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.740> New<00:01:44.040> York<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to be very very expensive but on top of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.999 
to be very very expensive but on top of
that<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.880> released<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.450> dud<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.680> event

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
convergence because of that it didn't

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.639 
convergence because of that it didn't
really<00:02:02.549> sell<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.540> well<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.140> since

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
really sell all that well and since

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.560 
really sell all that well and since
convergence<00:02:05.219> DC<00:02:05.670> sales<00:02:05.939> haven't<00:02:06.240> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
convergence DC sales haven't really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
convergence DC sales haven't really
recovered<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.200> feel<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.819> understand

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
recovered and I feel like I understand

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.050 
recovered and I feel like I understand
why<00:02:09.110> they<00:02:10.110> dumped<00:02:10.979> continuity<00:02:11.580> basically

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
why they dumped continuity basically

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.140 
why they dumped continuity basically
they're<00:02:12.239> saying

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
they're saying

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.360 
they're saying
creativity<00:02:13.720> /<00:02:14.079> continuity<00:02:14.739> which<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.099> theory

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
creativity / continuity which in theory

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.000 
creativity / continuity which in theory
is<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.670> nice<00:02:16.239> idea<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.230> reason<00:02:17.709> people

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is a nice idea but the reason people

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.550 
is a nice idea but the reason people
like<00:02:18.610> DC<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.390> Marvel<00:02:19.750> Comics<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.110> reason

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
like DC and Marvel Comics the reason

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.559 
like DC and Marvel Comics the reason
people<00:02:20.769> read<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.340> big<00:02:21.489> two<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.909> because

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
people read the big two is because

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.449 
people read the big two is because
they're<00:02:22.750> not<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:23.140> stories<00:02:23.470> they're<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:24.159> set

really really special and it was a

really unique way of telling stories and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.420 
really unique way of telling stories and
there<00:02:55.629> is<00:02:55.720> no<00:02:55.900> reason<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.560> couldn't<00:02:56.769> get<00:02:57.069> right

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
dropping it to me always seemed very

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.250 
dropping it to me always seemed very
very<00:03:05.980> confusing<00:03:06.519> by<00:03:07.180> removing<00:03:07.480> continuity

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
very confusing by removing continuity

from like 1986 till 2006 and see what

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.590 
from like 1986 till 2006 and see what
they<00:04:50.860> did<00:04:50.920> there<00:04:51.100> because<00:04:51.670> really<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.420> me

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
they did there because really for me

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.510 
they did there because really for me
that<00:04:52.810> was<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.080> peak<00:04:53.290> time<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.770> DC<00:04:54.100> that's<00:04:54.310> when

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that was the peak time of DC that's when

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.780 
that was the peak time of DC that's when
DC<00:04:55.060> was<00:04:55.480> at<00:04:55.690> its<00:04:56.020> best<00:04:56.260> for<00:04:56.620> me<00:04:56.740> personally<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
DC was at its best for me personally the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.670 
DC was at its best for me personally the
reason<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.270> particular<00:04:58.630> time<00:04:59.110> period<00:04:59.350> is

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
reason this particular time period is

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.790 
reason this particular time period is
special<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.400> because<00:05:00.610> DC<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.690> Marvel<00:05:02.110> didn't

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
special is because DC and Marvel didn't

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.710 
special is because DC and Marvel didn't
care<00:05:03.100> what<00:05:03.460> TV<00:05:03.850> shows<00:05:04.180> were<00:05:04.390> doing<00:05:04.630> they

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
didn't care what movies were doing they

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.600 
didn't care what movies were doing they
just<00:05:07.030> did<00:05:07.570> their<00:05:07.810> thing<00:05:08.500> they<00:05:08.890> didn't<00:05:09.160> care<00:05:09.370> if
