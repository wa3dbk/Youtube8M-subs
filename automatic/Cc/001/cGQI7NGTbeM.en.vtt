new Mega Man 9 downloadable content that

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.839 
new Mega Man 9 downloadable content that
just<00:00:16.520> got<00:00:16.670> released<00:00:17.890> first<00:00:18.890> up<00:00:19.189> we<00:00:19.369> had<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
just got released first up we had the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.519 
just got released first up we had the
proto<00:00:20.270> man<00:00:20.480> mode<00:00:20.720> which<00:00:20.930> says<00:00:21.050> she<00:00:21.169> play<00:00:21.349> as

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
proto man mode which says she play as

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.249 
proto man mode which says she play as
proto<00:00:22.160> man<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:22.730> it's<00:00:22.910> 200<00:00:23.270> points<00:00:23.570> and

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
proto man and it's 200 points and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.650 
proto man and it's 200 points and
there's<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.710> endless<00:00:25.220> attack<00:00:25.519> mode<00:00:25.760> which<00:00:26.060> is

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
there's the endless attack mode which is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.599 
there's the endless attack mode which is
sort<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.230> like<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.380> survival<00:00:28.039> mode<00:00:28.189> for<00:00:28.460> Mega

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
sort of like a survival mode for Mega

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.759 
sort of like a survival mode for Mega
Man<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.619> that's<00:00:30.619> 300<00:00:31.099> points<00:00:31.400> so<00:00:32.290> Alice<00:00:33.290> let's

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
Man and that's 300 points so Alice let's

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.229 
Man and that's 300 points so Alice let's
take<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.980> look<00:00:34.129> at<00:00:34.220> proto<00:00:34.489> man<00:00:34.699> move<00:00:34.940> first

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
take a look at proto man move first

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.910 
take a look at proto man move first
because<00:00:35.690> it's<00:00:36.199> probably<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.710> more

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
because it's probably the more

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.369 
because it's probably the more
interesting<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.610> two<00:00:38.080> Protomen<00:00:39.080> mode

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
interesting of the two Protomen mode

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.469 
interesting of the two Protomen mode
allows<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.460> plays<00:00:40.640> program<00:00:40.970> in<00:00:41.059> as<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.299> say

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
allows you to plays program in as I say

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.899 
allows you to plays program in as I say
so<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.470> do<00:00:43.370> things<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.670> little<00:00:43.729> bit

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
so you do things a little bit

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.539 
so you do things a little bit
differently<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:44.750> play<00:00:45.049> more<00:00:45.799> similarly<00:00:46.280> to

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
differently you play more similarly to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.600 
differently you play more similarly to
the<00:00:47.360> later<00:00:47.570> Mega<00:00:47.869> Man<00:00:48.080> games<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:48.769> proto<00:00:49.430> man

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
the later Mega Man games so proto man

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.579 
the later Mega Man games so proto man
does<00:00:49.790> have<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.089> slide<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.780> he<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.170> able<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
does have to slide and he is able to

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.579 
does have to slide and he is able to
charge<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.920> Buster<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:54.110> can<00:00:54.290> make<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
charge the Buster and this can make the

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.320 
charge the Buster and this can make the
game<00:00:54.769> play<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.129> little<00:00:55.309> bit<00:00:55.489> differently<00:00:55.879> he

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
game play a little bit differently he

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.490 
game play a little bit differently he
can<00:00:56.510> only<00:00:56.659> shoot<00:00:57.019> up<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.979> two<00:00:59.080> Buster<00:01:00.080> shots<00:01:00.320> at

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
can only shoot up to two Buster shots at

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.219 
can only shoot up to two Buster shots at

a time as opposed to Mega Man 3 but you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.750 
a time as opposed to Mega Man 3 but you
know<00:01:03.320> he<00:01:03.619> does<00:01:03.830> have<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.100> ability<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.430> charge

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
know he does have the ability to charge

you can use it by jumping in time

you can use it by jumping in time
incorrectly<00:01:13.869> when<00:01:14.920> projectiles<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.549> know

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
incorrectly when projectiles you know

incorrectly when projectiles you know
shot<00:01:17.000> at<00:01:17.119> you

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
shot at you

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.539 
shot at you
you<00:01:18.020> reflect<00:01:18.380> them<00:01:18.530> back<00:01:18.710> at<00:01:18.829> them<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.340> also

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
you reflect them back at them it also

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.630 
you reflect them back at them it also
does<00:01:19.850> cause<00:01:20.090> them<00:01:20.270> damage<00:01:21.310> which<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> pretty

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
does cause them damage which is pretty

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.550 
does cause them damage which is pretty
cool<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.179> don't<00:01:23.420> know<00:01:23.509> if<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> really<00:01:23.960> adds<00:01:24.259> much

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
cool I don't know if it really adds much

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.919 
cool I don't know if it really adds much
to<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.159> missed<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.850> game<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.359> it's<00:01:26.719> just

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
to it I missed the game but it's just

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.789 
to it I missed the game but it's just
kind<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.259> nice<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.679> have<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.219> guess<00:01:29.499> put<00:01:30.499> a<00:01:30.560> man

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
kind of nice to have I guess put a man

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.130 
kind of nice to have I guess put a man
does<00:01:31.429> have<00:01:31.609> some<00:01:31.820> downfalls<00:01:32.329> though<00:01:32.630> he<00:01:32.929> does

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
does have some downfalls though he does

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.590 
does have some downfalls though he does
take<00:01:33.350> more<00:01:33.590> damage<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.280> not<00:01:35.119> only<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.359> he

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
take more damage and not only that he

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.819 
take more damage and not only that he
does<00:01:35.780> get<00:01:35.960> thrown<00:01:36.200> back<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.439> bit<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.590> in

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
does get thrown back a bit so really in

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.520 
does get thrown back a bit so really in
some<00:01:40.039> areas<00:01:40.399> will<00:01:40.579> be<00:01:40.700> easier<00:01:41.329> some<00:01:41.749> at<00:01:42.229> for

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
some areas will be easier some at for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.249 
some areas will be easier some at for
example<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.460> know<00:01:43.579> jewel<00:01:44.359> men's<00:01:44.569> Joe<00:01:45.049> man's

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
example you know jewel men's Joe man's

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.529 
example you know jewel men's Joe man's
minie<00:01:45.679> balls<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:46.789> easy<00:01:47.090> when<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.509> have

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
minie balls is pretty easy when you have

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.550 
minie balls is pretty easy when you have
the<00:01:47.689> slide<00:01:48.219> but<00:01:49.659> some<00:01:50.659> jumping<00:01:51.079> puzzles<00:01:51.469> are

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the slide but some jumping puzzles are

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.779 
the slide but some jumping puzzles are
harder<00:01:51.799> because<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.219> get<00:01:52.369> thrown<00:01:52.609> back

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
harder because you get thrown back

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.719 
harder because you get thrown back
farther<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.679> got<00:01:55.069> to<00:01:55.189> be<00:01:55.280> care<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.670> you

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
farther so you got to be care and you

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.969 
farther so you got to be care and you
can<00:01:55.850> also<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.659> know<00:01:56.810> die<00:01:57.079> faster<00:01:57.560> because<00:01:57.859> you

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
can also you know die faster because you

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.200 
can also you know die faster because you
take<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.310> damage<00:01:58.429> you<00:01:58.670> got<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.969> be<00:01:59.030> more

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
take more damage you got to be more

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.870 
take more damage you got to be more
careful<00:01:59.359> about<00:01:59.829> you<00:02:00.829> know<00:02:00.920> how<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.159> run

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
careful about you know how you run

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.690 
careful about you know how you run
through<00:02:02.090> certain<00:02:02.450> areas<00:02:02.749> I<00:02:03.549> really<00:02:04.549> like

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
through certain areas I really like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.550 
through certain areas I really like
proto<00:02:04.939> man<00:02:05.119> mode<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.569> be<00:02:05.659> honest<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:06.049> think<00:02:06.109> I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
proto man mode to be honest I think I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.040 
proto man mode to be honest I think I
think<00:02:07.310> proto<00:02:07.520> man<00:02:07.700> mode<00:02:07.880> adds<00:02:08.119> genuine<00:02:08.750> you

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
think proto man mode adds genuine you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.790 
think proto man mode adds genuine you
know<00:02:09.170> game<00:02:09.440> replay<00:02:10.009> value<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
know game replay value because it is you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.110 
know game replay value because it is you
know<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.069> same<00:02:13.250> game<00:02:13.459> but<00:02:13.490> as<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.819> different

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
know the same game but as a different

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.420 
know the same game but as a different
character<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.560> much<00:02:15.770> as<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.100> could<00:02:16.280> have

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
character not as much as it could have

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.000 
character not as much as it could have
if<00:02:16.610> they'd<00:02:16.850> changed<00:02:17.630> things<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.930> bit<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.350> it's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
if they'd changed things a bit like it's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.960 
if they'd changed things a bit like it's
not<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:19.370> different<00:02:19.580> as<00:02:19.790> playing<00:02:20.060> 0a0<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.620> make

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
not as different as playing 0a0 and make

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.770 
not as different as playing 0a0 and make
an<00:02:22.060> X<00:02:22.330> 4<00:02:22.570> then<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.140> X<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.850> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
an X 4 then it is X but you know it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.630 
an X 4 then it is X but you know it's
still<00:02:26.050> different<00:02:26.290> enough<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.430> beat

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
still different enough and if you beat

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.200 
still different enough and if you beat
in<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.820> game<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> couple<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.480> times<00:02:28.720> then<00:02:29.140> it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
in the game a couple of times then it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.700 
in the game a couple of times then it
you<00:02:31.210> know<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.510> different<00:02:31.840> challenge<00:02:32.080> not

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
you know it's a different challenge not

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.010 
you know it's a different challenge not
being<00:02:33.010> able<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.280> buy<00:02:33.520> stuff<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> store<00:02:34.420> you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
being able to buy stuff in the store you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.230 
being able to buy stuff in the store you
know<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.350> makes<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.980> hard<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.310> go

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
know that makes it kind of hard to go

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.110 
know that makes it kind of hard to go
through<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.660> later<00:02:37.870> stages<00:02:38.290> because<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.310> lot

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
through the later stages because a lot

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.750 
through the later stages because a lot
of<00:02:40.210> people<00:02:40.480> need<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.410> rely<00:02:41.770> on<00:02:41.800> eat<00:02:42.100> ank's<00:02:42.490> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
of people need to rely on eat ank's and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390 
of people need to rely on eat ank's and
you<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.240> lives<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.990> get<00:02:44.170> through<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.280> in

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you know lives to just get through so in

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.500 
you know lives to just get through so in
that<00:02:45.490> sense<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.940> makes<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> game<00:02:46.480> more

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
that sense it makes the game more

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.710 
that sense it makes the game more
difficult<00:02:46.870> along<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.630> know

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
difficult along with the the you know

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.610 
difficult along with the the you know
the<00:02:49.780> more<00:02:50.020> recoil<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.920> damage<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.520> take<00:02:51.700> but

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the more recoil and damage you take but

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.320 
the more recoil and damage you take but
it<00:02:53.620> overall<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.490> fair<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.820> new<00:02:54.880> challenge

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
it overall it's a fair and new challenge

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.170 
it overall it's a fair and new challenge
and<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:56.140> fun<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.740> definitely<00:02:57.520> worth

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and it's fun and definitely worth

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.949 
and it's fun and definitely worth
checking<00:02:58.480> out

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
checking out

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.530 
checking out
now<00:02:59.709> let's<00:03:00.430> take<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> look<00:03:00.850> at<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> endless

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
now let's take a look at the endless

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.560 
now let's take a look at the endless
attack<00:03:01.900> mode<00:03:02.200> which<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:04.030> know<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.420> said

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
attack mode which you know as I said

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.710 
attack mode which you know as I said
it's<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> survival<00:03:05.350> mode<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:07.060> randomly

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it's a survival mode it's randomly

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.050 
it's a survival mode it's randomly
sequence<00:03:08.320> levels<00:03:09.190> where<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.430> just<00:03:09.730> go

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
sequence levels where you just go

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.470 
sequence levels where you just go
through<00:03:10.420> each<00:03:11.380> one's<00:03:11.740> like<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.700> each<00:03:13.150> each

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
through each one's like and each each

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.650 
through each one's like and each each
screen<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.620> recorded<00:03:15.490> as<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:16.330> go<00:03:16.450> through

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
screen is recorded as you go through

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.170 
screen is recorded as you go through
them<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.590> object<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.190> obviously<00:03:18.520> go<00:03:19.090> as

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
them the object is to obviously go as

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.350 
them the object is to obviously go as
far<00:03:19.330> as<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.540> can<00:03:19.630> without<00:03:19.750> dying<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.850> do<00:03:22.060> get

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
far as you can without dying you do get

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.880 
far as you can without dying you do get
to<00:03:22.480> start<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.810> every<00:03:23.080> weapon<00:03:23.440> though<00:03:23.620> and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
to start with every weapon though and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.250 
to start with every weapon though and
you<00:03:24.280> also<00:03:24.430> get<00:03:24.640> rushed<00:03:24.910> yet<00:03:25.150> upgrade<00:03:25.810> so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
you also get rushed yet upgrade so

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.699 
you also get rushed yet upgrade so
that's<00:03:27.100> nice<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.080> it's<00:03:29.080> still<00:03:29.380> pretty

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
that's nice and it's still pretty

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's nice and it's still pretty
difficult<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.820> by<00:03:30.940> having<00:03:31.060> all<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.330> weapons

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
difficult it's by having all the weapons

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.259 
difficult it's by having all the weapons
at<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.930> start<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.500> some<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> screens<00:03:34.030> are

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
at the start and some of the screens are

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.350 
at the start and some of the screens are
just<00:03:34.450> really<00:03:34.930> brutal<00:03:35.850> there's<00:03:36.850> just<00:03:37.090> more

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
just really brutal there's just more

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.630 
just really brutal there's just more
jumping<00:03:37.780> puzzles<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.470> enemies<00:03:38.830> just<00:03:39.040> it's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
jumping puzzles and enemies just it's

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.910 
jumping puzzles and enemies just it's
just<00:03:39.790> stuff<00:03:40.510> flying<00:03:40.840> everywhere<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.739> just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
just stuff flying everywhere and it just

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.400 
just stuff flying everywhere and it just
makes<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.280> game<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:42.640> hectic<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.720> really<00:03:44.170> do

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
makes the game more hectic I I really do

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.009 
makes the game more hectic I I really do
like<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.769> challenge<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:46.300> adds<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.840> it's

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
like the challenge it adds and it's

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.300 
like the challenge it adds and it's
definitely<00:03:47.260> worth<00:03:47.440> picking<00:03:47.680> up<00:03:47.860> if<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.160> want

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
definitely worth picking up if you want

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.770 
definitely worth picking up if you want
to<00:03:48.400> lengthen<00:03:48.519> your<00:03:48.820> replay<00:03:49.209> value<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.570> Mega

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
to lengthen your replay value of Mega

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.060 
to lengthen your replay value of Mega
Man<00:03:49.989> 9<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:52.260> can't<00:03:53.260> really<00:03:53.440> say<00:03:53.680> they<00:03:53.860> could<00:03:54.010> have

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
Man 9 I can't really say they could have

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.250 
Man 9 I can't really say they could have

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
added more to this because they didn't

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.050

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
thought the regular Mega Man 9 games too

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.100 
thought the regular Mega Man 9 games too
hard<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.700> wouldn't<00:04:07.420> suggest<00:04:07.570> picking<00:04:08.019> up

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
hard and I wouldn't suggest picking up

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.229 
hard and I wouldn't suggest picking up
endless<00:04:08.410> attack<00:04:08.680> mode<00:04:09.010> because<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.730> do<00:04:09.850> think

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
endless attack mode because I do think

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.740 
endless attack mode because I do think
it<00:04:10.360> requires<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.320> lot<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.100> time<00:04:12.540> patience<00:04:13.540> and

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
it requires a lot of time patience and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.930 
it requires a lot of time patience and
you<00:04:14.080> know<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.950> got<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.160> replay<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> lot<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.850> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
you know you got to replay a lot of the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.640 
you know you got to replay a lot of the
same<00:04:16.150> screens<00:04:16.630> before<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.140> get<00:04:17.290> them<00:04:17.440> down

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
same screens before you get them down

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.610

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.980

that<00:04:41.050> they've<00:04:41.440> announced<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.600> thus<00:04:43.600> far<00:04:43.840> at
