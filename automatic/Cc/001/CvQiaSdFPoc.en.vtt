00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
particularly good place to hide the body

particularly good place to hide the body
up<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.380> corner<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.950> great<00:03:45.340> place<00:03:45.549> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
up in this corner is a great place to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.580 
up in this corner is a great place to
start<00:03:46.000> since<00:03:46.510> he'll<00:03:46.720> be<00:03:46.840> clear<00:03:47.079> for<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.319> short

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
start since he'll be clear for a short

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.080 
start since he'll be clear for a short
time<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.400> will<00:03:48.519> give<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> most

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
time and it will give you the most

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.690 
time and it will give you the most
breathing<00:03:49.540> room<00:03:49.690> for<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.110> other<00:03:50.290> two<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:51.519> can

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
breathing room for the other two you can

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
breathing room for the other two you can
wait<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.209> last<00:03:52.420> two<00:03:52.660> bodyguards<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.440> be

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
wait for the last two bodyguards to be

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.710 
wait for the last two bodyguards to be
farther<00:03:53.860> apart<00:03:54.040> before<00:03:54.400> taking<00:03:55.000> them<00:03:55.090> out<00:03:55.269> but

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
farther apart before taking them out but

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.630 
farther apart before taking them out but
it<00:03:55.840> works<00:03:56.079> best<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.799> just<00:03:57.069> take<00:03:57.310> them<00:03:57.519> out

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
it works best to just take them out

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.670 
it works best to just take them out
around<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.269> point<00:03:58.569> so<00:03:58.989> there's<00:03:59.170> less<00:03:59.380> ground

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
around this point so there's less ground

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.190 
around this point so there's less ground
to<00:03:59.769> cover<00:03:59.950> for<00:04:00.370> your<00:04:00.549> final<00:04:00.910> kill<00:04:01.150> one<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:01.900> two

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
to cover for your final kill one and two

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.289
