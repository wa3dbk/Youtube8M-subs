00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.510 
I think the greatest part about all this
is<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.420> they've<00:00:52.140> stuck<00:00:52.440> true<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
is that they've stuck true to the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
is that they've stuck true to the
gameplay<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> physics<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
gameplay and the physics and just the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
gameplay and the physics and just the
way<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> games<00:00:56.010> run<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> original<00:00:57.840> Halo

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

game's<00:01:45.630> development<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.590> talks<00:01:46.829> about<00:01:46.950> how

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
game's development it talks about how

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
game's development it talks about how
the<00:01:47.310> game<00:01:47.640> came<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the game came to be and some of the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.960 
the game came to be and some of the
decisions<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:50.310> led<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> direction

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
decisions that have led to the direction

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
decisions that have led to the direction
for<00:01:51.780> each<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.140> their<00:01:52.259> expansions<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
for each of their expansions it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
for each of their expansions it
basically<00:01:53.790> covers<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.479> entire<00:01:54.810> timeline<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
basically covers the entire timeline of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
basically covers the entire timeline of
these<00:01:55.860> ten<00:01:56.159> years<00:01:56.490> from<00:01:56.790> before<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> game

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
these ten years from before the game

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
these ten years from before the game
existed<00:01:58.320> before<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> launched<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.729> launch

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
existed before is launched to the launch

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.050 
existed before is launched to the launch
of<00:02:00.299> vanilla<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.170> its<00:02:01.350> immediate<00:02:02.060> explosion

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of vanilla to its immediate explosion

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
of vanilla to its immediate explosion
and<00:02:03.270> growth<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.170> each<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and growth and then each of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
and growth and then each of the
subsequent<00:02:04.950> expansions<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.820> along<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
subsequent expansions and along the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.059 
subsequent expansions and along the
lines<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.659> talk<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.350> about<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
lines they talk a little bit about the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
lines they talk a little bit about the
developers<00:02:09.060> personal<00:02:09.539> lives<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> sort<00:02:10.349> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
developers personal lives and sort of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.869 
developers personal lives and sort of
what<00:02:10.619> each<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.039> these<00:02:11.129> things<00:02:11.400> meant<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> them

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
what each of these things meant to them

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
what each of these things meant to them
it<00:02:12.270> was<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.720> good<00:02:12.959> watch<00:02:13.230> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it was a really good watch and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.320 
it was a really good watch and
Oh<00:02:13.920> part<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.550> reason<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.940> really

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
Oh part of the reason that I really

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.210 
Oh part of the reason that I really
really<00:02:15.660> did<00:02:15.810> enjoy<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.590> enjoy<00:02:16.890> things

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
really did enjoy this and I enjoy things

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
really did enjoy this and I enjoy things
like<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.600> these<00:02:18.690> developer

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
like this is that these developer

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
like this is that these developer
documentaries<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.340> humanize<00:02:21.090> these

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
documentaries really humanize these

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.510 
documentaries really humanize these
games<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.200> these<00:02:22.320> companies<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.430> it's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
games and these companies I think it's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
games and these companies I think it's
very<00:02:23.700> easy<00:02:23.910> from<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> outside<00:02:24.870> when<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.290> we

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
very easy from the outside when you we

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.740 
very easy from the outside when you we
play<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> game<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> community<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.060> get<00:02:27.330> riled

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
play a game as a community to get riled

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.270 
play a game as a community to get riled
up<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.960> upset<00:02:28.380> about<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.800> thing<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
up and upset about this thing and that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.830 
up and upset about this thing and that
thing<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.760> they're<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.150> stupid<00:02:30.390> how<00:02:30.660> can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
thing you know they're so stupid how can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.780 
thing you know they're so stupid how can
they<00:02:30.930> make<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.230> change<00:02:31.470> or<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.830> change<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
they make this change or that change to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
they make this change or that change to
see<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> people<00:02:34.410> who<00:02:34.650> made<00:02:34.860> these

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
see and have the people who made these

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.340 
see and have the people who made these
games<00:02:35.310> sort<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.970> talk<00:02:36.240> through<00:02:36.630> their<00:02:37.050> thought

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
games sort of talk through their thought

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.230 
games sort of talk through their thought
process<00:02:37.890> why<00:02:38.100> they<00:02:38.340> did<00:02:38.550> these<00:02:38.730> things<00:02:39.000> what

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
process why they did these things what

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.270 
process why they did these things what
they<00:02:39.420> hoped<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:40.050> would<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
they hoped it would do and then the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.340 
they hoped it would do and then the
subsequent<00:02:41.610> fall<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.210> if<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> bad<00:02:43.320> idea

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
subsequent fall out if it was a bad idea

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.980 
subsequent fall out if it was a bad idea
or<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.310> subsequent<00:02:44.880> boon<00:02:45.210> if<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> good
