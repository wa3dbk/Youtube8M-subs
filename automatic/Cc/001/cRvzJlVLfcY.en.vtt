 passionate about growing as much as possible 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 transgenic poplars in 2004 here in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 these five brands in our verification we 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 found one hundred percent gamma from ingredient 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 labeling was not look it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.719
 leading multinational companies here 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 this is food this food for 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.629
 infants in such a way that now is not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 told multinational companies 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.129
 about their policies about their relationship with 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 by consumers and so on i'm always 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.229
 I remember these here are our checks 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.350
 I always remember when and after 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.450
 of that when we stated but here are the cia 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 that you have found these brands GMOs 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 when a multinational company doesn't 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 blindly suing us in court but we are with you 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.830
 we understand that we are in a situation 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.409
 when unfortunately the business we believe as 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.150
 consumers with you can not and now I 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.950
 I want to briefly dwell on those 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.829
 independent research 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.470
 which are generally iconic for the whole world 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 we now notice that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.079
 these studies can be counted on 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.320
 fingers of two hands 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.600
 they were generally not enough in the world 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 the explanation is very simple unfortunately these 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.290
 research nobody finance if 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 you found money for an independent 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.659
 research has done this research for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.009
 scientists problems are just beginning 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.780
 virtually all western scientists who 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.979
 conducted such independent research 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 end up left without 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.090
 say so without work because they 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.880
 moved to the marginal zone actually 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.250
 all dismiss institutions at all was 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 pressured first study 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.069
 which generally thundered in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.659
 re 98 year was spent on he spent 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.849
 feet potato and rules checked him 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.069
 safety as a result of laboratory 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.230
 animals fed gamma give 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.670
 oppression was observed in potatoes 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.390
 immune system impairment 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.819
 glad 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.819
 a number of organs of the liver and intestinal tract 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.590
 spleen brain and so on and im from i 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.519
 I don't stop here knowingly 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.629
 detail there with scientific terminology that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.660
 what happened to animals, let's say so 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:49.160
 they were inferior animal animals 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.440
 got such organ changes 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.230
 allotments and so on and including 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.530
 brains which are essentially life incompatible 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.030
 this is a mutation this is a degradation study 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.200
 Dr. Ermakova 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.359
 in 2010 in russia they passed a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.989
 the results were also monstrous in 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:12.170
 Result 1 is generally the main result. 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.349
 which she did not 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.299
 It turned out 2 generations of rat animals 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.150
 born she fed her animals 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.489
 experimental before mating males and females 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.799
 she fed before mating during 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.090
 mating and pregnancy in this way 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.489
 she didn't get 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.129
 second generation she fed animals 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.379
 genetically modified soy about what 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.560
 says siralini cheese or does not say 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:39.620
 the result is monstrous I can't end 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 understand the mechanism of getting that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.349
 it happens in some way 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.810
 inserted genes affect 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.410
 animals either this accumulated glyphosate 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.449
 fed animals mean two years 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.579
 corn and these are cancerous 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:59.090
 tumors he got and now the most 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:02.870
 interesting given when we found this one 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.840
 information picture asked for itself 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.290
 you want to look into your eyes 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.190
 these 30 percent of scientists who 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.010
 evaluation of scientific supplement to the magazine to 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.190
 British Times newspaper from 500 scientists 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.719
 working in the biotech industry 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.530
 UK 30 percent reported that 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.660
 were 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.970
 change your booty data 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.550
 at the request of the sponsors you understand what 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.460
 it says generally all all scientists are not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.460
 only any take noobs
