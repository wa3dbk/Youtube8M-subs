00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
I'm going to talk about four in

I'm going to talk about four in
particular<00:00:33.129> that<00:00:34.030> are<00:00:34.660> doing<00:00:35.019> really<00:00:35.170> well

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
particular that are doing really well

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.380

Marauder<00:00:37.809> pretty<00:00:38.650> much<00:00:38.800> any<00:00:38.980> variation<00:00:39.610> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
Marauder pretty much any variation you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.810 
Marauder pretty much any variation you
know<00:00:41.379> depending<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:41.800> what<00:00:41.920> you're<00:00:42.040> doing<00:00:42.309> can

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
know depending on what you're doing can

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.700 
know depending on what you're doing can
make<00:00:42.970> use<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.629> few<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.180> these<00:00:46.870> are<00:00:46.930> some<00:00:47.559> that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
make use of a few so these are some that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.799 
make use of a few so these are some that
are<00:00:47.770> less<00:00:48.040> useful<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.700> stagger<00:00:49.030> could<00:00:49.510> be<00:00:49.600> good

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
are less useful to stagger could be good

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.690 
are less useful to stagger could be good
I<00:00:50.170> haven't<00:00:50.559> really<00:00:50.800> tested<00:00:50.980> with<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.460> very

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
I haven't really tested with it very

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.200 
I haven't really tested with it very
much<00:00:52.890> once<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.070> survivability<00:00:54.489> becomes<00:00:55.030> that

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
much once the survivability becomes that

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.790 
much once the survivability becomes that
big<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.450> an<00:00:55.539> issue<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.960> kind<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.289> lacking

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
big of an issue you kind of lacking

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.520 
big of an issue you kind of lacking
damage<00:00:57.280> as<00:00:57.430> well<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.239> don't<00:00:58.660> know<00:00:58.960> there's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
damage as well so I don't know there's

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.450 
damage as well so I don't know there's
potential<00:01:00.010> here<00:01:00.039> with<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.520> one<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:03.399> of

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
potential here with that one a lot of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.619 
potential here with that one a lot of
these<00:01:03.610> other<00:01:03.820> ones<00:01:04.000> aren't<00:01:04.180> going<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.420> trigger

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
these other ones aren't going to trigger

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.859 
these other ones aren't going to trigger
off<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:05.199> your<00:01:06.090> centuries<00:01:07.090> landing<00:01:07.509> damage

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
off of your centuries landing damage

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.290 
off of your centuries landing damage
chance<00:01:08.289> on<00:01:08.470> hid<00:01:08.710> things<00:01:09.070> like<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.460> we're<00:01:10.180> not

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
chance on hid things like that we're not

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.940 
chance on hid things like that we're not
going<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.539> trigger<00:01:10.750> from<00:01:11.020> your<00:01:11.140> centuries<00:01:11.590> so

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
going to trigger from your centuries so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.380 
going to trigger from your centuries so
a<00:01:12.100> lot<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.759> these<00:01:12.910> are<00:01:13.060> not<00:01:13.210> that<00:01:13.420> great

duration which is going to give you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.580 
duration which is going to give you
potentially<00:02:07.539> thirty<00:02:07.810> percent<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.350> image

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
potentially thirty percent of the image

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.729 
potentially thirty percent of the image
one<00:02:08.800> hundred<00:02:09.009> percent<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.399> time<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.560> one

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
one hundred percent of the time this one

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.979 
one hundred percent of the time this one
is<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> damage<00:02:12.190> distance<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.420> one<00:02:13.630> has<00:02:13.780> been

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
is the damage distance this one has been

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.590 
is the damage distance this one has been
changed<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> used<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> deal<00:02:15.220> damage<00:02:15.550> based<00:02:16.300> on

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
changed it used to deal damage based on

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
changed it used to deal damage based on
the<00:02:16.870> distance<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.769> from<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> monsters

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
the distance you are from the monsters

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.580 
the distance you are from the monsters
they<00:02:19.060> changed<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.690> where<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> was<00:02:19.989> distance

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
they changed it to where it was distance

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.360 
they changed it to where it was distance
from<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.360> centuries<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.720> example<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.010> I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
from the centuries for example so I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.860 
from the centuries for example so I
don't<00:02:24.640> know<00:02:24.760> exactly<00:02:25.150> how<00:02:25.329> effective<00:02:25.750> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
don't know exactly how effective this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.479 
don't know exactly how effective this
one<00:02:26.079> is<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> end<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:27.070> does<00:02:27.250> have

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
one is going to end up it does have

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.960 
one is going to end up it does have
potential<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.299> is<00:02:28.420> pretty<00:02:28.690> good<00:02:28.930> even<00:02:29.970> though

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
potential it is pretty good even though

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.420 
potential it is pretty good even though
it<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.840> based<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.530> sentries<00:02:32.950> distance

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
it is now based on the sentries distance

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180 
it is now based on the sentries distance
you<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.360> still<00:02:34.630> easily<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.799> easy

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you can still easily get you know easy

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.430 
you can still easily get you know easy
six<00:02:37.180> plus<00:02:37.690> percent<00:02:38.110> damage<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.890> there<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
six plus percent damage on there and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.520 
six plus percent damage on there and
then<00:02:41.440> obviously<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.579> enforcer<00:02:43.530> everybody's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
then obviously the enforcer everybody's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.410 
then obviously the enforcer everybody's
familiar<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.190> one<00:02:45.400> kurt<00:02:45.970> chance<00:02:46.239> to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
familiar with this one kurt chance to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.080 
familiar with this one kurt chance to
your<00:02:46.540> pets<00:02:46.780> your<00:02:47.530> sentries<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.250> count<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.790> pets

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
your pets your sentries do count as pets

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.550 
your pets your sentries do count as pets
so<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> increase<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.350> good

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
so this is going to increase the good

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.319 
so this is going to increase the good
chance<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.190> centuries<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:51.910> well<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.209> your

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.160 
level i'm going to start running that
currently<00:03:25.000> i'm<00:03:25.180> actually<00:03:25.359> running<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:25.930> one

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
currently i'm actually running this one

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.470 
currently i'm actually running this one
just<00:03:27.010> because<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.670> one<00:03:27.849> doesn't<00:03:27.879> last<00:03:28.300> that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480

well for me this one I would like to get
at<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:48.050> higher<00:03:48.260> level<00:03:48.290> it's<00:03:48.920> going<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.130> be

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
at a higher level it's going to be

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.510 
at a higher level it's going to be
really<00:03:49.400> good<00:03:49.610> later<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:51.340> most<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.460> these

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
really good later and most of these

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.950 
really good later and most of these
other<00:03:52.730> ones<00:03:52.910> are<00:03:52.970> not<00:03:53.150> doing<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.420> well<00:03:53.540> and

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
other ones are not doing that well and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
that's pretty much going to do it here

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.650 
that's pretty much going to do it here
so<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.660> know<00:03:56.780> these<00:03:57.020> four<00:03:57.320> are<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.530> top<00:03:57.800> ones
