00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
you're taking the next nugget and you
are<00:02:17.489> rolling<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.209> you're<00:02:18.420> cutting<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.020> in

are rolling it and you're cutting it in
half<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.629> of<00:02:21.750> them<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
half you can put one of them down and

we<00:02:26.910> call<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.650> division<00:02:28.910> okay<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we call this division okay it's like you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.430 
we call this division okay it's like you
have<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.650> divide<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.310> into<00:02:32.519> pieces

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
have one and you divide it into pieces

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
have one and you divide it into pieces
like<00:02:34.440> subtraction<00:02:35.090> sort<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.209> like

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
like subtraction sort of like

subtraction<00:02:36.930> except<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.379> like<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> make

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
subtraction except for like so you make

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:58.970 
subtraction except for like so you make
two<00:02:44.640> little<00:02:45.060> balls<00:02:45.269> right<00:02:46.080> here<00:02:57.050> if<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.560> your

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
two little balls right here if if your

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.369 
two little balls right here if if your
balls<00:02:59.250> tend<00:02:59.849> to<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.120> different<00:03:00.510> sizes<00:03:01.080> it's

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
balls tend to be different sizes it's

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.160 
balls tend to be different sizes it's
okay<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.909> ball<00:03:03.120> could<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.599> bigger<00:03:03.810> than<00:03:04.019> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
okay one ball could be bigger than the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.460 
okay one ball could be bigger than the
other

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
other
