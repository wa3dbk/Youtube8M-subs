today<00:00:20.609> we're<00:00:20.820> talking<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:22.410> injectors

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
today we're talking about the injectors

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
today we're talking about the injectors
firing<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:28.019> ECM<00:00:28.769> does<00:00:29.369> supply<00:00:29.880> naturally<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
firing the ECM does supply naturally the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.250 
firing the ECM does supply naturally the
firing<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> injectors<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.050> what<00:00:34.050> can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
firing of the injectors and what can

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580 
firing of the injectors and what can
happen<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> power<00:00:37.260> supply

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
happen out there is the power supply

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
happen out there is the power supply
within<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> ECM<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:40.079> weak<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:42.120> will

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
within the ECM will get weak and it will

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
within the ECM will get weak and it will
not<00:00:42.660> fire<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.890> injectors<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
not fire the injectors if you get a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.020 
not fire the injectors if you get a
simple<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:47.910> objector<00:00:48.390> pestered<00:00:49.640> like<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.910> an

a signal strong signal from the ECM it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.939 
a signal strong signal from the ECM it
should<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> bright<00:01:01.920> flashing<00:01:02.879> light<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.949> if

that's missing that you're concerned is
that<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> injector<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> ECM<00:01:12.020> first

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that the injector is that the ECM first

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.670 
that the injector is that the ECM first
thing<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.770> check<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:15.119> output<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
thing you do is check the output of the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.850 
thing you do is check the output of the
ECM<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.600> an<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.869> forking<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> nice

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
six objector noid links but yeah that's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
six objector noid links but yeah that's
the<00:01:55.770> first<00:01:55.979> thing<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> can't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the first thing you do is if you can't

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
the first thing you do is if you can't
get<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.590> good<00:01:58.829> power<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.810> nice<00:02:01.530> powerful

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
get you know good power a nice powerful

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.959 
get you know good power a nice powerful
signal<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> injectors<00:02:05.399> firing

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
signal that that the injectors firing

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.740 
signal that that the injectors firing
correctly<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> ECM<00:02:07.550> then<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
correctly out of the ECM then you got a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.420 
correctly out of the ECM then you got a
problem<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.280> ICI

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
problem with the ICI

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.410 
problem with the ICI
so<00:02:13.430> sum<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.180> up<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:15.530> takes<00:02:15.769> about<00:02:16.060> five<00:02:17.060> minutes

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so sum it up it takes about five minutes

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.119 
so sum it up it takes about five minutes
to<00:02:17.810> determine<00:02:18.709> if<00:02:19.430> an<00:02:19.610> ECM<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.420> bad<00:02:20.689> or<00:02:20.959> not<00:02:21.129> if

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
to determine if an ECM is bad or not if

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.160 
to determine if an ECM is bad or not if
you<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.640> power<00:02:22.909> going<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.659> fuel

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
you got good power going to the fuel

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.100 
you got good power going to the fuel
solenoid<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.189> opens<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:26.110> normally

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
solenoid and it opens it up normally

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.899 
solenoid and it opens it up normally
your<00:02:27.349> your<00:02:27.829> input<00:02:28.340> power<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:29.599> good<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.950> that

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
your your input power is good and that

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.740 
your your input power is good and that
means<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.829> you<00:02:33.829> can<00:02:34.069> halfway<00:02:34.760> assume<00:02:35.209> that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
means that I you can halfway assume that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.809 
means that I you can halfway assume that
you're<00:02:35.989> getting<00:02:36.230> power<00:02:36.409> to<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.859> ECM<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.430> it's

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you're getting power to the ECM and it's

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.160 
you're getting power to the ECM and it's
correct<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.939> the<00:02:40.939> next<00:02:41.239> step<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.659> just<00:02:41.870> to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
correct and the next step is just to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.710 
correct and the next step is just to
simply<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:43.340> what<00:02:43.519> happens<00:02:43.909> when<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.299> turn<00:02:44.569> it

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
simply see what happens when you turn it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.629 
simply see what happens when you turn it
turn<00:02:45.109> it<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.859> should<00:02:46.099> be<00:02:46.250> getting<00:02:46.430> a

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
turn it on and you should be getting a

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.250 
turn it on and you should be getting a
nice<00:02:46.849> powerful<00:02:47.239> signal<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:50.049> ECM<00:02:51.049> to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
nice powerful signal out of the ECM to

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.800 
nice powerful signal out of the ECM to
fire<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.769> injectors<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:54.519> you're<00:02:55.519> not<00:02:55.810> yet

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
fire the injectors but you're not yet

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.099 
fire the injectors but you're not yet
out<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.230> quagmire<00:02:57.609> okay<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:59.420> cam<00:02:59.689> sensor

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
out of the quagmire okay the cam sensor

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.490 
out of the quagmire okay the cam sensor
comes<00:03:00.829> into<00:03:01.220> play<00:03:01.459> here<00:03:01.700> okay<00:03:02.689> and<00:03:02.750> sensor<00:03:03.290> can

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
comes into play here okay and sensor can

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.050 
comes into play here okay and sensor can
be<00:03:03.530> bad<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:05.889> supplies<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:07.040> signal<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.939> the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
be bad and it supplies a signal to the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.229 
be bad and it supplies a signal to the
ECM<00:03:08.569> that<00:03:08.930> supplies<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:10.459> firing<00:03:10.939> of<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
ECM that supplies the firing of the

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.420 
ECM that supplies the firing of the
injector<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.109> you<00:03:12.560> need<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.889> take<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:13.400> step

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
injector so you need to take it one step

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.500 
injector so you need to take it one step
further<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:15.699> check<00:03:16.699> your<00:03:16.849> km<00:03:17.150> sensor<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:19.510> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
further and check your km sensor and and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.920 
further and check your km sensor and and
the<00:03:20.810> sensor<00:03:21.530> harness<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.269> you've<00:03:23.569> got<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.810> get

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the sensor harness so you've got to get

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.199 
the sensor harness so you've got to get
that<00:03:24.109> signal<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.010> ECM<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.579> fires<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that signal to the ECM to fires and

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.970 
that signal to the ECM to fires and
objectors<00:03:27.879> until<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:29.090> get<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.709> nice

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
objectors until you get that in a nice

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.610 
objectors until you get that in a nice
bright<00:03:31.819> light<00:03:32.090> coming<00:03:32.359> out<00:03:32.629> of<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.900> ECM<00:03:33.790> then

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
bright light coming out of the ECM then

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.379 
bright light coming out of the ECM then
you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.769> that's<00:03:37.400> where<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.909> stay<00:03:38.150> right

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
you know that's where you stay right

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.490 
you know that's where you stay right
with<00:03:38.659> it<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.530> there's<00:03:40.040> actually<00:03:40.489> three<00:03:40.819> steps

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
with it so there's actually three steps

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500 
with it so there's actually three steps
you<00:03:42.500> know<00:03:42.590> check<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.579> voltage<00:03:43.729> it<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.299> feel

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
you know check the voltage it you feel

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.599 
you know check the voltage it you feel
solenoid<00:03:45.109> check<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.979> see<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.250> you're<00:03:46.400> getting

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
solenoid check to see if you're getting

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.390 
solenoid check to see if you're getting
a<00:03:46.669> signal<00:03:47.150> out<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.479> the<00:03:47.569> ECM<00:03:48.139> if<00:03:48.889> you're<00:03:49.159> not

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
a signal out of the ECM if you're not

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.319 
a signal out of the ECM if you're not
and<00:03:50.229> you<00:03:51.229> put<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> new<00:03:51.739> cam<00:03:52.400> sensor<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:53.060> door

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
and you put a new cam sensor on door

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.580 
and you put a new cam sensor on door
usually<00:03:53.930> about<00:03:54.109> sixty<00:03:54.680> bucks<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:57.319> check

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
usually about sixty bucks and you check

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.449 
usually about sixty bucks and you check
the<00:03:57.799> sensor<00:03:58.250> harness<00:03:59.109> and<00:04:00.109> or<00:04:00.829> put<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> new

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
the sensor harness and or put a new

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.300 
the sensor harness and or put a new
sensor<00:04:02.090> harness<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.690> it's<00:04:02.870> eight<00:04:03.680> years<00:04:04.069> or

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
sensor harness if it's eight years or

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.240 
sensor harness if it's eight years or
more<00:04:04.549> older<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:06.049> now<00:04:06.260> you've<00:04:06.590> pretty<00:04:07.129> much

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
more older and now you've pretty much

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.390 
more older and now you've pretty much
got<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:10.010> all<00:04:10.280> together<00:04:10.459> here<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:12.709> determine<00:04:13.280> if

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
got it all together here to determine if

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.000 
got it all together here to determine if
your<00:04:13.609> ECM<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.209> better<00:04:14.449> now<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.440> again<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.859> can

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
your ECM is better now and again you can

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.029 
your ECM is better now and again you can
send<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.459> for<00:04:16.489> free<00:04:16.909> checking<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:18.260> we
