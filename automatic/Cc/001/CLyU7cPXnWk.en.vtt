00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.040
 there greets you once more in your story 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.430
 I have now come to the solution of the question of employability midfield bracarense 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
 remained nothing 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 fighting the state get to victory 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.829
 there's no way to track performance now 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.150
 A little better 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.359
 the date stipulated much of what I the opponent is so good as well 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 the portrait 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 but in practice it is a correction on the wings 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 at 07 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.120
 just to remember this 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.440
 even of medium risk 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 goddess hair 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 it's over 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
 if you put what I feel my choice 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 with the opponent so connected to the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.150
 he pointed out that 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.860
 and let's go 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 andreolli 'playboy' 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 in which they place names 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 the rice they got a little bit stronger 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 and a little way 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.249
 it was going so dry 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.989
 with Colonel Alfonso in case he did not see each other 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.699
 on top of the people who are evil 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.609
 I wanted her to 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.759
 say no 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.469
 there is no such thing 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.469
 designed shifts are not few 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.039
 and broadens 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.399
 was in the hand 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.899
 and I still managed to train 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.889
 If this magic has gone 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.509
 of threats 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.569
 the title 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.569
 Actually, it's so bad. 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.229
 control is a bet 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.719
 the other smaller 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.719
 fukumi 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.969
 so it is natural ferreira 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 Leiria and according to him this support help is dynamic 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 the auction ends today 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.990
 self-esteem 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.699
