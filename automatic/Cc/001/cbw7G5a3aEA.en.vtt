00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.510
 my experience that I did in Milan e 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 Saturday 2 March at the playnow gbyte telecom 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.109
 Italian first tell you a little as 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 of how it was king of whom I have 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.099
 met of whom I knew 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 I would like to talk a bit about the tournament 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.880
 then to a tournament that is based 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 mainly on seven games 5 on 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 tournaments are already concluded as that of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 mv 3 that ended at the games week of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.030
 Milan last November and the others 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 if they are going to finish up until you arrive 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.960
 to romics of Rome next April 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 so let's say tournament is a lot 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 important and in addition to the various 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.840
 information and among other things the last 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 parentheses who wins wins this stuff 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.530
 that I leave here well first second and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 third place 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 but ignoring these details 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.260
 I would like to talk to you a little about mine 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 experience and cocchi I have known 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.840
 how or how I met him and so on 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.880
 etc 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 so first of all I decided to do 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.509
 this video in the form of a blog does not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.080
 in the form of a documentary film 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.580
 I will use only a few clips of the event 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.110
 signed by china which i thank 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.340
 infinitely so that he really has me 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 kept company throughout the afternoon 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.369
 together with art his three friends a little 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 mentally ill people were very nice and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.890
 because more than anything I have not done in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 time I did not have time 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 material to film something was 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 brought my beautiful video camera no 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 I use this one but that one a little more 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 however scrausa is really been 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.600
 something impossible because I am 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.899
 arrived at the station look for Milan 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 around 10 and after the first scleri 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.900
 only being able to find was right 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.160
 especially thanks to alessandro di un 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.770
 look in me because it saved me because 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.370
 I was standing like a caciotta alla 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 stop waiting for the 701 round sixth 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.030
 world ok, I don't know, he says it 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.440
 he saved me took me in the car 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.560
 to the euronics of the shopping center 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.310
 volcano and we start them mine 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.800
 day 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.020
 and when I arrived there were already read 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.640
 and ron is brought immediately I read the saying a 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.430
 we wanted to do an autograph a photo a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.550
 autograph and then or against laurent 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 we played a bit of cod I lost 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.470
 miserably and he won because he is the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.720
 day then continued i went to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.280
 lunch even there the nfine came to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 ask her for autographs and photos and stuff 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.670
 by the way I have to show one 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.190
 what two files that I thank a lot 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 they gave me with a clothespin and one 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.590
 It was more like March with me 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.570
 given the made cloves are 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 same brand that I therefore put 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.660
 a neighbor to the penguin I thank them 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.940
 result my euronics I saw one 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 molletta who is elected attacks of the born 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.440
 note heel from another but ok anyway 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.250
 apart from the jokes we remain serious but me 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.250
 you are not a serious person 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.209
 oh well after bullshit and the afternoon is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.760
 arrived a lot more people have arrived 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.739
 what really struck me were 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 people who were unaware of this 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.349
 event like the old ladies and asked 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.969
 indeed they asked for their own Milanese 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.139
 fucking scrubs cutlet but all people are 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.930
 unfortunately it was bad because nobody 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.819
 says cock pussy cutlet try and then 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.099
 we explained a little about who we were and 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.989
 even china tries to explain 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.909
 that there was the sexy ron there an old lady 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.359
 Mom said I don't believe it and oh well 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.099
 however the afternoon has arrived 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.219
 we continued to play we were 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.280
 there to take pictures we did the little ones 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.540
 unfortunately I can't remember video with lego 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.269
 if we have finally succeeded in farioli 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.379
 guerron together but buoys and at the end 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.790
 we have all done together 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.760
 greeted a little we all presented 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.919
 the event we said what they would be 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.750
 been the next steps together with everyone 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.090
 those who came there to me does 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.849
 pleased that there have been so many 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.049
 people honestly didn't expect it 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.609
 but oh well there will certainly be others 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.079
 opportunities to meet above all 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.259
 because I understand that it is very difficult 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.139
 meet all the fans in one place 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.699
 because I have done Rome twice 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.080
 that is six hours of travel in a day e 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.080
 I understand that not everyone can do it and 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.710
 so we will always look for myself 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.599
 mostly i also like myself 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.460
 the other youtubes to make rallies a 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.259
 a little everywhere a little scattered to the north a 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.820
 the next is a bit absurd in the center 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.009
 it will probably be at the romics of Rome 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.750
 this however I am not sure yet at 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.759
 a hundred percent, however, I thank 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.110

 of those who recognized me 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.729

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.409
