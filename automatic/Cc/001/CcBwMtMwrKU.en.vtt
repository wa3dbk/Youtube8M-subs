00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
pine tree now this is one that I have

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.299 
pine tree now this is one that I have
just<00:00:11.960> don't<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.320> say<00:00:13.469> damaged<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.190> I've

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
just put a small little mark exposing

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.609 
just put a small little mark exposing
the<00:00:18.990> inner<00:00:19.260> bark<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:21.359> I've<00:00:21.869> done<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.289> so

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the inner bark and I've done this so

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
the inner bark and I've done this so
that<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.100> would<00:00:23.250> run<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.730> let<00:00:23.880> me<00:00:23.970> come<00:00:24.119> in

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
that it would run now let me come in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.750 
that it would run now let me come in
closer<00:00:24.600> move<00:00:24.930> zoom<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.350> don't<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.550> too

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
closer move zoom out so don't get too

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.210 
closer move zoom out so don't get too
shaky<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.199> done<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> could<00:00:28.949> get

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
shaky but I've done this so I could get

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
shaky but I've done this so I could get
some<00:00:29.279> pinch<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:30.330> SAP<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.349> resin<00:00:31.859> from<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> tree

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
some pinch or SAP or resin from the tree

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.340 
some pinch or SAP or resin from the tree
if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.719> guys<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.800> literally

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
if you see that guys that is literally

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
if you see that guys that is literally
running<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:39.329> will<00:00:39.570> slowly<00:00:39.960> start<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.770> run<00:00:41.670> down

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
running it will slowly start to run down

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
running it will slowly start to run down
and<00:00:42.329> funnel<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.590> area

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and funnel down into this little area

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
and funnel down into this little area
right<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.610> where<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.930> will

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
right there where I will when I will

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.529 
right there where I will when I will
come<00:00:46.110> back<00:00:46.350> later<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.770> collect<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> now

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
come back later and collect it now

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
come back later and collect it now
normally<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> try<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.739> look<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.129> around

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
normally I try to just look all around

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
normally I try to just look all around
the<00:00:50.610> tree<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.850> find<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.719> already

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the tree and find some that's already

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
the tree and find some that's already
dried<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> tree<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> solid<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
dried up but this tree is solid it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
dried up but this tree is solid it's
never<00:00:54.629> been<00:00:54.840> damaged<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.739> doesn't<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> any

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
never been damaged it doesn't have any

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.349 
never been damaged it doesn't have any
sickness<00:00:57.680> nothing<00:00:58.680> has<00:00:58.829> fallen<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sickness nothing has fallen on it to to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.770 
sickness nothing has fallen on it to to
damage<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> outer<00:01:01.230> layer<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.149> expose<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
damage the outer layer and to expose the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.890 
damage the outer layer and to expose the
inner<00:01:04.140> bark<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.430> send<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> tree<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
inner bark which would send the tree a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
inner bark which would send the tree a
signal<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.890> ahead<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.159> send<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.520> SAP<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
signal to go ahead and send some SAP to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
signal to go ahead and send some SAP to
that<00:01:09.060> area<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.830> dry<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that area and then it would dry up and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.730 
that area and then it would dry up and
then<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.610> collect<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.290> this<00:01:13.290> tree<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
then I could collect it but this tree is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
then I could collect it but this tree is
a<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:14.250> healthy<00:01:14.689> pretty<00:01:15.689> straight<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a pretty healthy pretty straight and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
a pretty healthy pretty straight and
it's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.520> pretty<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.450> solid<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's a pretty pretty solid so I have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
it's a pretty pretty solid so I have
decided<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.159> ahead<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> put<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> small

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
decided to go ahead and put a small

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
decided to go ahead and put a small
little<00:01:22.170> mark<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.040> I've<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.610> taken<00:01:23.880> out

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
little mark there I've just taken out

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.319 
little mark there I've just taken out
the<00:01:24.650> layers<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:27.920> outer<00:01:28.920> bark<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> see

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the layers here of outer bark and see

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
the layers here of outer bark and see
you<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> couple<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.590> before<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you got a couple of those before you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660 
you got a couple of those before you
start<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> nice<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.670> inner

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
start to get into that nice pretty inner

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
start to get into that nice pretty inner
bark<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.079> I'm<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:39.829> catch

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bark now what I'm going to do here catch

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
bark now what I'm going to do here catch
it<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.220> let<00:01:41.430> me<00:01:41.490> show<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:42.090> here's<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it down let me show you now here's a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.210 
it down let me show you now here's a
piece<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.850> taken<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.220> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
piece that I have taken now this is this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.910 
piece that I have taken now this is this
is<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.790> outer<00:01:47.970> bark<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.270> see

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
is the outer bark and as you can see

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
is the outer bark and as you can see
that<00:01:52.920> white<00:01:53.700> looking<00:01:54.090> stuff<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.470> new

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that white looking stuff is the the new

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.940 
that white looking stuff is the the new
layer<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.189> each<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.360> tree<00:01:58.200> completes<00:01:58.680> one

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
layer now each time a tree completes one

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.990 
layer now each time a tree completes one
year<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> will<00:02:00.090> add<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.869> ring<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.850> why

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
year it will add on a ring so that's why

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
year it will add on a ring so that's why
when<00:02:03.149> people<00:02:03.180> chop<00:02:03.659> trees<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.380> able

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
when people chop trees down they're able

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
when people chop trees down they're able
to<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.950> calculate<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.560> approximate

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
to actually calculate the approximate

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.080 
to actually calculate the approximate
age<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.369> tree<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:08.940> these<00:02:09.090> rings<00:02:09.450> will

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
age of a tree now these rings will

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.520 
age of a tree now these rings will
change<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.330> thickness<00:02:12.569> depending<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.349> how

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
change in thickness depending on how
much

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
much

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.680 
much
nutrition<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> tree<00:02:14.640> has<00:02:14.790> gotten<00:02:15.180> each<00:02:15.330> year

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
nutrition the tree has gotten each year

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.470 
nutrition the tree has gotten each year
but<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:17.280> tree<00:02:17.610> looks<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> did<00:02:18.270> pretty

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but this tree looks like it did pretty

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.930 
but this tree looks like it did pretty
good<00:02:18.770> about<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.950> same<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.550> can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.820> all

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
good about the same if you can see all

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.170 
good about the same if you can see all
the<00:02:21.060> other<00:02:21.180> rings<00:02:21.830> there<00:02:22.830> each<00:02:23.610> year<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the other rings there each year like I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.090 
the other rings there each year like I
said<00:02:24.330> it'll<00:02:24.570> gain<00:02:24.690> another<00:02:24.990> one<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.350> what

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
said it'll gain another one and what

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.340 
said it'll gain another one and what
happens<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.730> during<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> spring<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
happens is during the spring and the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.560 
happens is during the spring and the
summer<00:02:28.680> times<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.520> SAP<00:02:29.790> goes<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.270> running

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
summer times the SAP goes to running

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.410 
summer times the SAP goes to running
just<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.180> mean<00:02:33.180> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
just like you see right here I mean that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.750 
just like you see right here I mean that
tree<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:34.470> literally<00:02:34.800> send<00:02:35.250> SAP<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.730> over

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
tree will literally send SAP all over

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.660 
tree will literally send SAP all over
and<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.660> how<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.990> gains<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.440> new<00:02:37.590> layer<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and this is how it gains a new layer and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
and this is how it gains a new layer and
so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.960> do<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.470> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.970 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
let<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.840> run<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.080> I'll<00:02:43.170> come<00:02:43.410> back<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.920> few
