this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.650> review<00:00:02.070> on<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.550> EKF<00:00:03.240> c-terminal

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
this is my review on the EKF c-terminal

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.460 
this is my review on the EKF c-terminal
dual<00:00:04.470> parallel<00:00:05.009> three<00:00:05.640> slot<00:00:05.879> edition<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:07.140> UK

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
dual parallel three slot edition the UK

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.470 
dual parallel three slot edition the UK
FC<00:00:07.770> terminal<00:00:08.280> or<00:00:08.429> terminal<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.389> gonna

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
FC terminal or terminal and we're gonna

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.110 
FC terminal or terminal and we're gonna
call<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:09.990> short<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.860> basically<00:00:11.460> an<00:00:11.639> apparatus

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
call for short is basically an apparatus

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.289 
call for short is basically an apparatus
that<00:00:12.870> connects<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.889> two<00:00:14.190> GPU<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> turns<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
that connects the two GPU and turns it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.340 
that connects the two GPU and turns it
into<00:00:15.389> some<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.710> single<00:00:17.100> apparatus<00:00:18.350> well

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
into some like a single apparatus well

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
into some like a single apparatus well
it's<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.220> kind<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.609> hard<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> explain<00:00:21.060> it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
it's really kind of hard to explain it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.340 
it's really kind of hard to explain it
until<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:25.320> now

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
until you really see it and so right now

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
until you really see it and so right now
the<00:00:25.529> video<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.939> me<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.630> going

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the video you see is just me just going

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
the video you see is just me just going
on<00:00:28.080> boxing<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> actually<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.519> kind<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
on boxing and actually just kind of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.049 
on boxing and actually just kind of
gonna<00:00:30.510> show<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:32.059> install

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
gonna show you how to actually install

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.580 
gonna show you how to actually install
this<00:00:34.020> EK<00:00:34.829> FC<00:00:35.100> terminal<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this EK FC terminal so the first thing I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
this EK FC terminal so the first thing I
like<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> note<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.570> these

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
like you to note is that there are these

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
like you to note is that there are these
six<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.590> holes<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
six little holes you see on there and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
six little holes you see on there and
it's<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.840> hard<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.100> shaky

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it's kind of hard to see I'm this shaky

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's kind of hard to see I'm this shaky
so<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.750> camera<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.410> shaky<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> six

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so my camera is a bit shaky but the six

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.819 
so my camera is a bit shaky but the six
holes<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> front<00:00:48.989> cover<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
holes you see on the front cover so the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
holes you see on the front cover so the
one<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.739> with

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
one like the the up side the one with

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.180 
one like the the up side the one with
the<00:00:53.160> ek<00:00:53.730> logo<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.469> those<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.590> six<00:00:55.980> little

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the ek logo is those little six little

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.189 
the ek logo is those little six little
holes<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.520> screw<00:00:56.850> holes<00:00:57.059> those<00:00:57.750> six<00:00:57.960> screw

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
holes are screw holes those six screw

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.010 
holes are screw holes those six screw
holes<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:59.059> where<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.270> those<00:01:00.390> six<00:01:00.690> screws

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
holes or where you get those six screws

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
holes or where you get those six screws
are<00:01:01.260> actually<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> GPU<00:01:02.670> itself<00:01:03.300> I'm

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
are actually from the GPU itself I'm

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.560 
are actually from the GPU itself I'm
gonna<00:01:04.260> show<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> later<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
gonna show you how to do that later and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
gonna show you how to do that later and
at<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> bottom<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> would<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.799> like

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
at the bottom side you would see like

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969 
at the bottom side you would see like
just<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> Utes<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.810> four<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.710> these

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just now the Utes off four very these

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820 
just now the Utes off four very these
these<00:01:11.369> four<00:01:11.670> slim<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.409> oval

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
these four slim kind of little oval

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
these four slim kind of little oval
things<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.119> what's<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.720> going

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
things these are what's actually going

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
things these are what's actually going
to<00:01:16.110> connect<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.650> GPUs<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.900> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> sides

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to connect to your GPUs and on the sides

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
to connect to your GPUs and on the sides
like<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> saw<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> bit<00:01:20.490> before<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.689> saw

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
like you saw a bit before was you saw

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
like you saw a bit before was you saw
two<00:01:22.320> empty<00:01:22.619> holes<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
two empty holes in one like kind of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.899 
two empty holes in one like kind of
silver<00:01:24.240> silver<00:01:25.049> circle<00:01:25.799> thing<00:01:26.040> okay<00:01:26.610> that's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
silver silver circle thing okay that's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.749 
silver silver circle thing okay that's
and<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> two<00:01:28.619> hole<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:29.159> three<00:01:29.460> things

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and so the two hole these three things

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
and so the two hole these three things
the<00:01:30.420> three<00:01:30.659> circles<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> sides<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the three circles on the sides are the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
the three circles on the sides are the
screws<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.659> screws<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.170> um<00:01:34.380> they're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
screws or in a screws like um they're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.289 
screws or in a screws like um they're
where<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.520> your<00:01:35.640> screw<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> your

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
where you put your screw in your

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.690 
where you put your screw in your
fittings<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
fittings and if you don't know what a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
fittings and if you don't know what a
fitting<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.180> fitting<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
fitting is the fitting is the thing you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
fitting is the fitting is the thing you
kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.500> connect<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.159> hose<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> um<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
kind of connect your hose to so um the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
kind of connect your hose to so um the
ek<00:01:44.850> FCP<00:01:45.360> dual<00:01:45.570> parallel<00:01:45.960> three<00:01:46.470> slot<00:01:46.740> why<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
ek FCP dual parallel three slot why is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
ek FCP dual parallel three slot why is
it<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.850> slot<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> idea<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.420> what

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it the three slot so the idea of so what

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
it the three slot so the idea of so what
it<00:01:51.899> means<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.229> three<00:01:52.500> slot<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.159> where

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it means my three slot is that where

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
it means my three slot is that where
like<00:01:54.149> com<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> three<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
like com there there is a three there is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.930 
like com there there is a three there is
a<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.979> slop<00:01:59.369> gap<00:01:59.880> between<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.899> GPUs

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
a to slop gap between the GPUs

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.060 
a to slop gap between the GPUs
and<00:02:03.060> some<00:02:03.690> motherboard<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.830> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and some motherboard actually have that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.270 
and some motherboard actually have that
some<00:02:05.550> don't<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.770> two<00:02:08.010> slotted

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
some don't and so there's a two slotted

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.490 
some don't and so there's a two slotted
up<00:02:08.460> three<00:02:08.640> slot<00:02:08.850> addition<00:02:09.180> and<00:02:09.360> since<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.320> one

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
up three slot addition and since my one

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.880 
up three slot addition and since my one
has<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.970> slot<00:02:12.210> gap<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> one<00:02:13.290> slot<00:02:13.530> gap

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
has the two slot gap not a one slot gap

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.970 
has the two slot gap not a one slot gap
it<00:02:14.220> has<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.330> bought<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.870> need<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.500> buy<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> three

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it has I bought I need to buy the three

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.510 
it has I bought I need to buy the three
slot<00:02:17.160> Edition<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.930> um<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:19.980> parallel

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
slot Edition and so um for what parallel

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.630 
slot Edition and so um for what parallel
means<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.030> parallel<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.930> kind<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.500> way<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
means is parallel is kind of the way the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.690 
means is parallel is kind of the way the
water<00:02:23.880> flow<00:02:24.180> works<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.960> there's<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.350> ways

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
water flow works so there's two ways

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.130 
water flow works so there's two ways
there's<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> parallel<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.540> where<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.960> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
there's a parallel way where they just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.040 
there's a parallel way where they just
have<00:02:28.260> two<00:02:28.530> parallel<00:02:28.950> pipes<00:02:29.960> connecting<00:02:30.960> to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
have two parallel pipes connecting to

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.980 
have two parallel pipes connecting to
each<00:02:31.080> GPU<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.180> think<00:02:33.750> it's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
each GPU and they have I think it's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.680 
each GPU and they have I think it's
called<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> serial<00:02:36.080> which<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.350> basically

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
called the serial which is basically

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.710 
called the serial which is basically
which<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.870> basically<00:02:40.610> they<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.540> not

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
which is basically they it just it's not

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.590 
which is basically they it just it's not
really<00:02:43.110> too<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.920> continuous<00:02:44.700> parallel<00:02:45.210> on

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really too like continuous parallel on

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.970 
really too like continuous parallel on
tubes<00:02:45.990> one<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> tubes<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.510> um<00:02:48.980> is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
tubes one of the tubes is actually um is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.100 
tubes one of the tubes is actually um is
shorter<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.850> there's<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> gap<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
shorter and there's like a gap in the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.070 
shorter and there's like a gap in the
middle<00:02:52.260> well<00:02:52.680> not<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.520> gap<00:02:54.240> filled<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
middle well not like a gap filled in the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.560 
middle well not like a gap filled in the
middle<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.890> put<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.190> way<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:57.120> it's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
middle to put it that way and that it's

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.970 
middle to put it that way and that it's
just<00:02:57.750> another<00:02:57.990> way<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.260> cooling<00:02:58.770> there's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
just another way of cooling there's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.580 
just another way of cooling there's
honestly<00:02:59.400> no<00:02:59.640> difference<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:00.420> them<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.930> just

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
honestly no difference with them I just

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.620 
honestly no difference with them I just
bought<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.860> parallel<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.730> um<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.600> was

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
bought the parallel because um it was

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.870 
bought the parallel because um it was
just<00:03:03.870> available<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.770> time<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
just available at that time and so

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.380 
just available at that time and so
that's<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> reason<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.510> bought<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:08.100> as<00:03:08.489> you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
that's the reason I bought it so as you

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.690 
that's the reason I bought it so as you
can<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.750> current<00:03:10.350> um<00:03:10.560> from<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.310> past

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
can see I current um from the past

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.560 
can see I current um from the past
I<00:03:11.760> removed<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.360> three<00:03:12.720> screws<00:03:13.050> from<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.470> GPU

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
I removed the three screws from the GPU

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.600 
I removed the three screws from the GPU
from<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> GPU<00:03:16.260> water<00:03:16.500> block<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
from the GPU water block and this is the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.820 
from the GPU water block and this is the
final<00:03:17.850> product<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.470> supposed<00:03:19.530> to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
final product of what it's supposed to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.770 
final product of what it's supposed to
look<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.400> looks<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.730> lot<00:03:20.940> more<00:03:21.000> rigid<00:03:21.420> now

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
look like it looks a lot more rigid now

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.680 
look like it looks a lot more rigid now
and<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.170> actually<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.830> just<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.670> nice<00:03:24.000> so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and it actually is just really nice so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.290 
and it actually is just really nice so
this<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.200> my<00:03:25.350> review<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.250> UK<00:03:26.580> FC<00:03:26.880> terminal

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
this is my review of the UK FC terminal

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.709 
this is my review of the UK FC terminal
and<00:03:27.510> how<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> install<00:03:28.470> it
