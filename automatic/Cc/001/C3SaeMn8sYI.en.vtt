00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
bit more every single year and we

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.890 
bit more every single year and we
finally<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.410> know<00:00:36.640> made<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.790> happen<00:00:37.970> so<00:00:38.780> with

our first oversize we want to make sure
that<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:40.730> was<00:00:40.879> still<00:00:41.120> compatible<00:00:41.420> with

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
that it was still compatible with

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.270 
that it was still compatible with
helmets<00:00:42.110> obviously<00:00:42.530> with<00:00:42.650> those<00:00:42.799> we<00:00:42.979> wanted

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
to be multi faceted so it works in a

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.750 
to be multi faceted so it works in a
couple<00:00:45.350> different<00:00:45.470> video<00:00:46.220> with<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.519> couple

prescription frame comes in that'll

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.850 
prescription frame comes in that'll
actually<00:01:05.750> push<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.409> little<00:01:06.439> bit<00:01:06.710> more

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
