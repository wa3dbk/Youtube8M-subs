if you want so here we are it starts off
overhead<00:02:28.540> view<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.950> said<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.280> can't

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
overhead view like I said you can't

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.150 
overhead view like I said you can't
really<00:02:30.610> see<00:02:30.730> where<00:02:31.030> you're<00:02:31.150> going<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.690> well

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
you click the magnifying glass in tombs

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.040 
you click the magnifying glass in tombs
out<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.319> shows<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.890> entire<00:02:35.980> park<00:02:37.050> that's

another<00:02:38.380> thing<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.950> sorta<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:39.790> would<00:02:40.569> be

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
another thing I sorta what would be

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.320 
another thing I sorta what would be
happier<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.400> little<00:02:42.520> bit<00:02:42.700> larger<00:02:43.150> at

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
happier if it was a little bit larger at

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.860 
happier if it was a little bit larger at
the<00:02:44.140> moment<00:02:44.730> there's<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.300> there's<00:02:46.630> been

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the moment there's this is there's been

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.050 
the moment there's this is there's been
no<00:02:47.019> updates<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:47.769> at<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.400> moment<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:48.910> can

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
no updates but at the moment as you can

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.960 
no updates but at the moment as you can
see<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.390> fence<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.870> quite<00:02:50.640> there's<00:02:51.640> not<00:02:51.820> too

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
see the fence is quite there's not too

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.250 
see the fence is quite there's not too
much<00:02:52.090> space<00:02:52.390> here<00:02:53.940> alright<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.360> click<00:02:56.080> that

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
much space here alright so click that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.970 
much space here alright so click that
again<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> move<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.630> take<00:02:58.900> two<00:02:59.290> fingers<00:02:59.590> or

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
again so to move you take two fingers or

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.890 
again so to move you take two fingers or
your<00:03:00.100> thumbs<00:03:00.400> whatever<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.090> want<00:03:01.239> now<00:03:01.840> you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
your thumbs whatever you want now you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.440 
your thumbs whatever you want now you
put<00:03:02.260> one<00:03:02.350> finger<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.890> back<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.459> as<00:03:04.239> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
put one finger on the back and as you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.900 
put one finger on the back and as you
see<00:03:04.660> it's<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.350> realistic<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.010> look<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
see it's so realistic that look the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.270 
see it's so realistic that look the
physics<00:03:07.300> are<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.600> good<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.680> click<00:03:08.860> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
physics are so good if you click the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280 
physics are so good if you click the
back<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.640> actually<00:03:09.760> lifts<00:03:10.209> up<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.360> front<00:03:11.050> leg

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
back it actually lifts up the front leg

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.520 
back it actually lifts up the front leg
on<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> real<00:03:11.650> bored<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.150> turn<00:03:13.420> by<00:03:13.750> putting

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
on a real bored you can turn by putting

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.199 
on a real bored you can turn by putting
pushing<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.310> back<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.760> putting<00:03:15.910> pressure

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
pushing on the back and putting pressure

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.380 
pushing on the back and putting pressure
on<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.540> board<00:03:16.750> it'll<00:03:16.989> turn<00:03:17.200> it
