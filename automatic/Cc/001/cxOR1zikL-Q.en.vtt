00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.630
 okay then I'm going to sting 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.590
 the other side 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 so my pocket is doing her loans 1 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:29.720
 cl is 1.5 1.5 strong 1.5 mm 1.6 so 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.720
 here I am going to cover 1.5 strong 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:48.480
 frankly 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:51.180
 in addition we lose the benchmarks 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 the dimension that I had then wait 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.290
 I will put it back I do not have it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 is not a parish that drags a 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.120
 other why why do we stick that six 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 matches so I'm going to do since I 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 Be you put a pencil point is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.360
 you put with the singles you do 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 a little hole like that you see what 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 you see you see I have no noise 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.360
 well listen to this system the systems of 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 here either you take your nails if that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.260
 works well and you 're doing a phase here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.370
 of the game top 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.370
 in his own way 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.710
 so obviously it's five points to the cm 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 so do not forget to sting with 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:58.210
 small points before equipment 15.2 20 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.650
 cm so there the guys but if the hinge 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.170
 that's good enough we do not thirty-six 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 thickness I hope I did not 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:17.080
 plant you have long so here I 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:20.560
 course here I then cut in the middle I 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 cut I 'm going to do that I put my finger 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.930
 of saoula and I'm going to split middle then 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.250
 it would be nice to have a couple who 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.950
 listen to us well 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.930
 thank you so here I will sell but not 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.390
 over the entire length I'm crouching this is 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 what I'm going to cut into star so 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.690
 we are careful not to cut the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.790
 sewing values so we 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.360
 but he must touch it is also very 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.570
 important in the sewing we feel the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.530
 things and then 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:02.400
 here I can turn it over there and dolls 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.350
 in the direction of the end 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.550
 so we do not go further than the end 1 and O 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.550
 how much diagonally 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.170
 it's always a little hard all my stockings 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:27.190
 it is better to cut a half 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.690
 millimeter back I have not 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.360
 heat sealed here so it did not have to 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.030
 hold the fibers so there I go 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.330
 return all this little world there from 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.330
 the other side 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:04:01.160
 by then I'm adjusted I feared if 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.160
 I will adjust my role pass there 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.280
 I'm going to pin it here 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.260
 and here I want the right well upstairs 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.260
 now I 'm going to sew 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.909
 so here I sit here I liked it 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.909
 in circles I'm going to make breakpoints 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:47.849
 complement the manna eight years I sting 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:52.830
 will have then rounded a step in angle because 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:55.909
 that it's all dust hangers 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.909
 go on the 21st 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.460
 otherwise we take do not know if I can 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.460
 not take power 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:12.020
 and here it is enough that I raise the 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:12.020
 presser foot is a scandal 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.350
 it's good we'll see here 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.570
 the little what's not perfect then 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.760
 should it be half a millimeter 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.660
 indented the ends because you 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.910
 have a fit he's fit 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:42.650
 okay so here's pocket money from 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.030
 sup at this point there even pocket funds 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.460
 below that pocket after theft 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.070
 normally see cut the yoke 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.770
 and shot seen here so I did not hold the 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.340
 2 insets on and under 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:05.540
 sets because of the pocket bag 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:07.780
 first of all does it anyway you 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.780
 take
