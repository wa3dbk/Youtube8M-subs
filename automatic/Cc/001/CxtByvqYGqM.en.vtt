00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
know you've got to find a way in but it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.060 
know you've got to find a way in but it
actually<00:00:24.449> doesn't<00:00:24.810> volley<00:00:25.109> particularly

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
actually doesn't volley particularly

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
actually doesn't volley particularly
well<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.460> he's<00:00:26.699> caught<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.150> lief<00:00:27.359> says<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
well so he's caught as lief says you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.540 
well so he's caught as lief says you
know<00:00:28.380> between<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.650> rock<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.890> hard<00:00:29.070> place<00:00:29.220> I've

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
know between a rock and hard place I've

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.800 
know between a rock and hard place I've
got<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.210> something<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.599> very

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
got to do something I'm not very

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.030 
got to do something I'm not very
comfortable<00:00:31.230> doing<00:00:31.349> against<00:00:31.769> somebody

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
comfortable doing against somebody

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
comfortable doing against somebody
that's<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:32.669> pick<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.270> off<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that's going to probably pick me off I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000 
that's going to probably pick me off I
mean<00:00:33.690> again<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
mean again these are the these are the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
mean again these are the these are the
sort<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.309> mesh<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.090> through<00:00:36.149> your

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
sort of mesh that's going through your

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
sort of mesh that's going through your
mind<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.890> take<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
mind at that time but if we just take a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
mind at that time but if we just take a
quick<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.640> Novak's<00:00:39.600> movement<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
quick look at Novak's movement on this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
quick look at Novak's movement on this
forehand<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.739> pass<00:00:40.950> terrific<00:00:41.610> serve

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
forehand on this pass terrific serve

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
forehand on this pass terrific serve
here<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.450> shadi<00:00:42.719> there's<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> return<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
here from shadi there's the return but

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
here from shadi there's the return but
again<00:00:44.789> Marcus<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> remember<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
again Marcus if you can remember the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
again Marcus if you can remember the
other<00:00:46.559> day<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.160> talking<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
other day when I was talking about the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
other day when I was talking about the
back<00:00:48.660> end<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.140> taught<00:00:49.320> said<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.219> many

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
back end and we taught said how many

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.549 
back end and we taught said how many
steps<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.050> well

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
steps do you think you need to get well

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
steps do you think you need to get well
this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> another<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.610> case<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.149> point

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this is another another case in point

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
this is another another case in point
when<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.690> watch<00:00:54.870> tennis<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:56.010> thinking<00:00:56.460> at

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
when we watch tennis we're thinking at

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.580 
when we watch tennis we're thinking at
this<00:00:57.449> particular<00:00:57.660> point<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> look

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this particular point when you look

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
this particular point when you look
where<00:00:58.739> Novak<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> look<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> ball

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
where Novak is and you look at the ball

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
where Novak is and you look at the ball
which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> sort<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> heading<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
which is which is sort of heading in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.229 
which is which is sort of heading in
this<00:01:01.739> direction<00:01:01.879> you're<00:01:02.879> thinking<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this direction you're thinking to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
this direction you're thinking to
yourself

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
yourself

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.440 
yourself
he's<00:01:04.049> probably<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.360> possibly<00:01:06.360> three

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
he's probably got two possibly three

he's probably got two possibly three
with<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> shifts<00:01:07.830> they're<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.310> wide<00:01:08.729> now

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
with the shifts they're out wide now

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
with the shifts they're out wide now
just<00:01:09.600> run<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.320> look<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.770> Novak

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
again in slow motion it's just as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170 
again in slow motion it's just as
beautiful<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.250> mean<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
beautiful I mean it's just that the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.240

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
know right at the start and and it's

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.160 
know right at the start and and it's
taken<00:02:05.880> him<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> whole<00:02:06.479> different<00:02:06.630> level<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
taken him to a whole different level of
