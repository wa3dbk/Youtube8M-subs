00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
because you learned a lot about yourself

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.940 
because you learned a lot about yourself
when<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.620> ring<00:03:26.800> against

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that off and train just as hard probably

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.870 
that off and train just as hard probably
as<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.880> did<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.300> it's<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.140> lot<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.880> you
