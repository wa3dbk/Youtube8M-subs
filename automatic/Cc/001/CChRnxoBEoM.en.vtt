 ingredients 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.840

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.740
 butter and vanilla then we're going to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.000
 start by 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.000
 treat the eggs 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.630
 low 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 to go reaching the ingredients that I 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.300
 tell you if the ball we have now 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.200

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.329
 I'm adding in sugar 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.470
 faster 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.399

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.399
 i 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.880
 h 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.200
 one moment 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620
 the baking powder 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.150
 and we are going to beat 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.060
 let's see what we put the butter 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.060
 we put the vanilla 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.430
 we have the mass ready now what we're going 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.530
 to do 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.319
 we will use our cupcake lula 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.640
 take the spoon from her we're going to 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.150
 add our product line so 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.520

 when we use the product for 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.380
