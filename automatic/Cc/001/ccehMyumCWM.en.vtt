forward with a huge super speed boost

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.580 
forward with a huge super speed boost
and<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.480> basically<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> double

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and that's basically how you double

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.439 
and that's basically how you double

clutch now before this race does begin I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
clutch now before this race does begin I
just<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> say<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> both<00:01:04.470> vehicles<00:01:04.769> are

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
just like to say that both vehicles are

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920 
just like to say that both vehicles are
fully<00:01:05.430> upgraded<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.210> did<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.510> touch<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
fully upgraded and I did not touch the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
fully upgraded and I did not touch the
analog<00:01:07.290> stick<00:01:07.530> whatsoever<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.610> racing<00:01:09.000> with

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
analog stick whatsoever when racing with

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
analog stick whatsoever when racing with
these<00:01:09.299> vehicles<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:09.990> last<00:01:10.170> video<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
these vehicles in my last video where I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
these vehicles in my last video where I
compared<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> zentorno<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> Osiris<00:01:12.600> we

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
compared the zentorno to the Osiris we

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420 
compared the zentorno to the Osiris we
had<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> skeptical<00:01:13.799> people<00:01:14.100> suggesting

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
had a lot of skeptical people suggesting

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
had a lot of skeptical people suggesting
that<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.390> made<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> slight<00:01:15.930> turn<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that because I made a slight turn with

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.969 
that because I made a slight turn with
the<00:01:16.380> zentorno

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the zentorno

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
the zentorno
that<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> reason<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> lost<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that was the reason it lost because it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
that was the reason it lost because it
was<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> crooked<00:01:19.619> race<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> wasn't

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
was like a crooked race but that wasn't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399 
was like a crooked race but that wasn't
the<00:01:20.939> case<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.299> thus<00:01:21.689> lightness<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the case at all thus lightness of the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.719 
the case at all thus lightness of the
turn<00:01:22.619> literally<00:01:23.070> made<00:01:23.220> no<00:01:23.490> difference

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
turn literally made no difference

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
turn literally made no difference
whatsoever<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.750> tested<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.259> numerous

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
whatsoever and I tested it numerous

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.090 
whatsoever and I tested it numerous
times

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
times

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
times
so<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> Osiris<00:01:26.820> does<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> fact<00:01:27.299> beat<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so the Osiris does in fact beat out the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
so the Osiris does in fact beat out the
zentorno<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.860> head-to-head<00:01:29.310> race<00:01:29.729> I'd<00:01:30.299> also

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
zentorno in a head-to-head race I'd also

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.850 
zentorno in a head-to-head race I'd also
like<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.960> say<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> most

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
like to say that this is the most

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130 
like to say that this is the most
accurate<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.729> account<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> speed<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
accurate way to account for the speed of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
accurate way to account for the speed of
the<00:01:34.229> vehicles<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> go

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the vehicles because if you go

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
the vehicles because if you go
head-to-head<00:01:35.820> versus<00:01:36.540> players<00:01:36.960> basically

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
head-to-head versus players basically

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
head-to-head versus players basically
what<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.850> testing<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
what you're doing is you're testing the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
what you're doing is you're testing the
reaction<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.650> player<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
reaction time of the player and that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
reaction time of the player and that's
not<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.640> testing<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.210> car<00:01:42.390> itself<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.899> am

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
not really testing the car itself I am

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.440 
not really testing the car itself I am
going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> test<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.040> car<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> car<00:01:44.970> alone

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
going to test the car and the car alone

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.080 
going to test the car and the car alone
singular<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.770> car<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> being<00:01:47.700> said

what<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start<00:01:50.040> both<00:01:50.490> races<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.180> both<00:01:51.420> clips<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.110> the

start both races or both clips at the
exact<00:01:52.979> frame<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.670> move<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.240> enough

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
exact frame that they move that's enough

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:20.839

talk<00:01:54.689> let's<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.259> into<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.560> race

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
so as you guys can tell the Osiris has

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.470 
so as you guys can tell the Osiris has
actually<00:02:23.829> won<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.219> race<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.819> test<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.299> raw

a race course as opposed to a
straightaway<00:02:34.900> where<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.319> had<00:02:35.469> some<00:02:35.680> turning

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
straightaway where you had some turning

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.500 
straightaway where you had some turning
to<00:02:36.159> do<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.519> maybe<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.879> little<00:02:37.120> bit<00:02:37.239> more

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
to do it maybe a little bit more

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.720 
to do it maybe a little bit more
advantageous<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.409> use<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.920> Banshee<00:02:39.310> given<00:02:39.639> it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
advantageous to use the Banshee given it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.789 
advantageous to use the Banshee given it
as<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.000> fastest<00:02:40.569> accelerating<00:02:40.719> vehicle<00:02:41.650> in

the game 100% and just to make sure

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.270 
the game 100% and just to make sure
everything<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.319> accurate<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:44.950> gonna<00:02:45.159> do

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
everything is accurate I'm gonna do

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.399 
everything is accurate I'm gonna do
another<00:02:45.609> test<00:02:45.969> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.329> two<00:02:46.510> vehicles<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.260> see

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
another test of the two vehicles to see

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.289 
another test of the two vehicles to see
who<00:02:47.530> wins<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.370> time<00:02:48.700> I'm<00:02:48.969> gonna<00:02:49.150> be

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
who wins but this time I'm gonna be

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.270 
who wins but this time I'm gonna be
adding<00:02:49.719> a<00:02:49.840> wing<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.439> Banshee<00:02:50.859> which<00:02:51.069> for

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
adding a wing to the Banshee which for

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.619 
adding a wing to the Banshee which for
those<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.730> don't<00:02:51.939> know<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.329> wing

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
those of you that don't know a wing

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.270 
those of you that don't know a wing
actually<00:02:52.840> improves<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.530> handling<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:54.129> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
actually improves the handling of the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
actually improves the handling of the
Banshee<00:02:54.669> so<00:02:54.849> what<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:55.209> going<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.569> give<00:02:55.810> us

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
Banshee so what that's going to give us

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
Banshee so what that's going to give us
is<00:02:56.109> some<00:02:56.379> grip<00:02:56.709> which<00:02:56.919> is<00:02:57.099> very<00:02:57.310> important

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
is some grip which is very important

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.369 
is some grip which is very important
with<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:57.970> double<00:02:58.299> clutch<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.750> let's<00:02:58.959> see<00:02:59.139> how

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
with the double clutch so let's see how

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.199 
with the double clutch so let's see how
it<00:02:59.560> does<00:02:59.590> with<00:03:00.159> the<00:03:00.280> wing<00:03:00.519> added<00:03:00.939> to<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
it does with the wing added to the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.099 
it does with the wing added to the
Banshee<00:03:05.909> bossboss<00:03:06.909> hard<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.419> my<00:03:07.540> chest<00:03:07.810> breaks

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
Banshee bossboss hard to my chest breaks

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.720 
Banshee bossboss hard to my chest breaks
up<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.379> my<00:03:08.650> lungs<00:03:08.889> get<00:03:09.159> wrecked<00:03:09.400> with<00:03:09.579> the

a huge shout out to GT a wise guy who

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.770 
a huge shout out to GT a wise guy who
actually<00:03:49.400> did<00:03:49.580> all<00:03:49.849> this<00:03:49.970> research<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.629> ensure

actually did all this research to ensure

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.229 
actually did all this research to ensure
that<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.170> was<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> 100%<00:03:51.920> accurate<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.209> a

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
that it was a 100% accurate and it was a

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.330 
that it was a 100% accurate and it was a
test<00:03:53.629> of<00:03:53.810> not<00:03:53.959> only<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.319> car<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.099> player

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340

have<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.410> look<00:03:57.530> at<00:03:57.739> when<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:57.920> comes<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.340> these

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489
