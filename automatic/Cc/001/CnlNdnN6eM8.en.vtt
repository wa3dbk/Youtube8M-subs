00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
one so I tend to this one and then I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
one so I tend to this one and then I
changed<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.079> course<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.280 
changed it back but of course I had to
live<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> rest<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.220> life<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
live out the rest of this life with this

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
live out the rest of this life with this
lmg<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.680> honestly<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> whole<00:01:35.369> time<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> was

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
lmg and honestly the whole time I was

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
lmg and honestly the whole time I was
playing<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.360> some<00:01:36.600> reason<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
playing with it for some reason I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
playing with it for some reason I
thought<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> hog<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.799> mean<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.729> didn't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
thought was a hog I mean I just didn't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.789 
thought was a hog I mean I just didn't
feel<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.720> awkward<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.320> thought<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> should

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
feel as awkward as I thought it should

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.030 
feel as awkward as I thought it should
have<00:01:40.829> been<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.640> lmg<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.979> know

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
have been for an lmg and I don't know

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
have been for an lmg and I don't know
some<00:01:44.340> somehow<00:01:44.790> someway<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.479> actually

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
some somehow someway this one actually

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
some somehow someway this one actually
ended<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:45.990> working<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.100> all

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
to assist those two assists right there

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.070 
to assist those two assists right there
kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> taken<00:02:11.849> away<00:02:12.030> from<00:02:12.209> my

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
kind of taken away from my

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.430 
kind of taken away from my
um<00:02:14.390> kills<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.600> there<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.350> do

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.470 
um kills right there but what can you do
and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.010> let's<00:02:17.460> see<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.760> guy<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.060> taken<00:02:18.360> as

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and then let's see that guy was taken as

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.630 
and then let's see that guy was taken as
well<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.260> was<00:02:19.740> potentially<00:02:20.250> three<00:02:20.430> kills

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
well so I was potentially three kills

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.460 
well so I was potentially three kills
that<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.880> could<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.210> gotten<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.320> is

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that I could have gotten but this is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.080 
that I could have gotten but this is
something<00:02:22.650> i<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.040> usually<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.790> you'll

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
something i don't usually do and you'll

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.250 
something i don't usually do and you'll
notice<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.420> other<00:02:24.570> nuke<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.930> i<00:02:24.990> ended<00:02:25.200> up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
notice the other nuke that i ended up

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.760 
notice the other nuke that i ended up
getting<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.250> map<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:27.270> weeks<00:02:28.260> ago<00:02:28.410> I

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
getting on this map two weeks ago I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.590 
getting on this map two weeks ago I
ended<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.340> getting<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.790> from<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> other<00:02:30.450> side

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
ended up getting it from the other side

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.840 
ended up getting it from the other side
I<00:02:30.870> believe<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.160> one<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.520> getting

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
I believe and this this one I'm getting

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.960 
I believe and this this one I'm getting
from<00:02:34.010> from<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.220> side<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.550> never<00:02:35.760> usually

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
from from this side and I never usually

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
from from this side and I never usually
push<00:02:36.270> up<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.840> side<00:02:37.020> because<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.040> do

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
push up on this side because if you do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.740 
push up on this side because if you do
they<00:02:38.520> always<00:02:38.670> spawn<00:02:39.000> they<00:02:39.270> end<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.480> spawning

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
they always spawn they end up spawning

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
they always spawn they end up spawning
like<00:02:40.020> right<00:02:40.230> behind<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:41.100> right<00:02:41.310> in

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
this area where I'm at right now if i

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.770 
this area where I'm at right now if i
push<00:02:43.710> even<00:02:43.980> farther<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.790> then<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.630> if

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
push even farther up and then there if

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
push even farther up and then there if
there's<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.050> couple<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.440> other<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.980> my<00:02:47.100> buddies

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that kind of spawn by me then it just

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.510 
that kind of spawn by me then it just
totally<00:02:49.260> throws<00:02:49.530> everything<00:02:49.740> off<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.130> here

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520

totally throws everything off but here
I'm<00:02:50.700> trying<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> use<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.090> ACR<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.990> is

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
I'm trying to use the ACR and this is

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.480 
I'm trying to use the ACR and this is
actually<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.620> tree<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> ACR

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
actually kind of a tree to use the ACR

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.800 
actually kind of a tree to use the ACR
that<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> picked<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:54.000> off<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> ground<00:02:54.390> because

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that I picked up off the ground because

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.980 
that I picked up off the ground because
I<00:02:55.680> didn't<00:02:56.220> i<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:57.330> i<00:02:57.390> might<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.720> unlocked

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
I didn't i think i might have unlocked

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
getting the kills up to to get it with

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.980 
getting the kills up to to get it with
the<00:04:31.379> chopper<00:04:31.710> gunner<00:04:31.889> also<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:33.240> had<00:04:33.689> to<00:04:33.810> switch

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
the chopper gunner also I had to switch

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.839 
the chopper gunner also I had to switch
it<00:04:34.110> up<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.289> was<00:04:34.469> doing<00:04:34.650> some<00:04:34.830> 6v6<00:04:35.129> for<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.699> while

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
it up and was doing some 6v6 for a while

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.850 
it up and was doing some 6v6 for a while
because<00:04:36.060> ground<00:04:36.719> war<00:04:36.930> was<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.259> crazy<00:04:37.560> hacked

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
because ground war was so crazy hacked

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.360 
because ground war was so crazy hacked
that<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.460> try<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.729> do<00:04:38.909> some<00:04:39.090> 6v6<00:04:39.389> lobbies<00:04:40.110> and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
that I try to do some 6v6 lobbies and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.350

use<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> chopper<00:04:41.789> gunner<00:04:41.819> than<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.180> because

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
use a chopper gunner than that because

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.969 
use a chopper gunner than that because
