situation but it's not just enough to

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.080 
situation but it's not just enough to
think<00:07:24.320> about<00:07:24.590> that<00:07:24.830> we<00:07:25.250> have<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.610> do<00:07:25.760> something

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:28.730 
we have to return to the Father and the

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.730 
we have to return to the Father and the
Bible<00:07:29.120> says<00:07:29.300> that<00:07:29.510> as<00:07:29.630> this<00:07:29.810> boy<00:07:30.050> returns<00:07:30.530> to

the<00:07:30.860> father<00:07:31.100> as<00:07:31.400> he<00:07:31.790> comes<00:07:32.060> back<00:07:32.180> in<00:07:32.510> the<00:07:32.600> right

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
the father as he comes back in the right

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.190 
the father as he comes back in the right
attitude<00:07:33.380> so<00:07:34.010> the<00:07:34.550> father<00:07:34.850> forgives<00:07:35.750> him<00:07:35.960> well

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 
attitude so the father forgives him well
