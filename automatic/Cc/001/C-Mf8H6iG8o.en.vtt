everything<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.939> refreshing<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:22.039> new

gasket<00:00:23.640> seals<00:00:23.970> head<00:00:24.300> gaskets<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.170> thought

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
gasket seals head gaskets and I thought

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.210 
gasket seals head gaskets and I thought
I<00:00:25.439> had<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.880> rear<00:00:26.880> main<00:00:27.150> leak<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.710> getting<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
I had a rear main leak I was getting a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.369 
lot of fluid down here on the bottom and
I<00:00:37.670> was<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.940> sure<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:40.320> had<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> rear<00:00:40.890> main<00:00:41.129> leak

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
I was for sure it had a rear main leak

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.750 
I was for sure it had a rear main leak
and<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.739> oil<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.280> dripping<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.450> my

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.100 
and the oil was dripping down on my
manifold<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.440> center<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:50.610> there

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
manifold there in the center right there

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.340 
manifold there in the center right there
but<00:00:54.440> lucky<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.660> was<00:00:57.660> messing<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
but lucky for me I was messing with this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
but lucky for me I was messing with this
distributor<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.649> oil

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
distributor and right there's the oil

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.609 
distributor and right there's the oil
pressure<00:01:02.250> cinder<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.199> when<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.409> messing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pressure cinder and when I was messing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
pressure cinder and when I was messing
with<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.159> distributor<00:01:05.939> cap<00:01:07.760> behold<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.939> look

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
with that distributor cap behold I look

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
with that distributor cap behold I look
down<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> top<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> engine<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
down there on the top of the engine and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.499 
down there on the top of the engine and
it<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.760> soaked<00:01:12.630> oil<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.860> pouring<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
it was soaked oil was just pouring out

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.940 
it was soaked oil was just pouring out
and<00:01:15.509> basically<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.259> old<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.840> had<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.340 

deteriorated<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> top<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
deteriorated at the top and which is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.670 
deteriorated at the top and which is
pouring<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.890> along<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.490> seam<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.500> been

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
pouring out along that seam so I've been

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.700 
pouring out along that seam so I've been
running<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.130> engine<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.500> while

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
running this engine for a good while

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
running this engine for a good while
there's<00:01:32.130> no<00:01:32.310> more<00:01:32.549> leaks<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.470> great

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
there's no more leaks so that's great

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
there's no more leaks so that's great
because<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> thinking<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
because I was really kind of thinking I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.249 
because I was really kind of thinking I
was<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:38.540> look<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> rear

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
was gonna have to look into that rear

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
was gonna have to look into that rear
main<00:01:40.470> seal<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> ever<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
main seal again so if you ever think you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590 
main seal again so if you ever think you
have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> rear<00:01:42.600> main<00:01:42.810> seal<00:01:42.950> leak<00:01:44.420> check<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
have a rear main seal leak check that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.550 
have a rear main seal leak check that
out<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.710> 1972<00:01:47.899> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.110> probably<00:01:49.409> the
