00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.840
 hi people I'm here again with 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.450
 tobias in the studio hello there and today 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.299
 we want to bag you about these boats 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 the big shuttle xl report that exactly 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.850
 and you have it again yesterday 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 Knowing was traveling with two people in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:37.079
 hamburg they are now hello me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 Welcome here in Hamburg 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 docklands on the steel ship 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 absolute secret tip for sunset I can 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.899
 only recommend 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 i have a panorama patrick here and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 i have the big bottles xl here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 user to stabilize the tripod 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.449
 and the absolutely brilliant thing I can do 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 now from the top nicely in the bag 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.750
 because I shut up 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 fold away at the front that can be very 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.859
 fast lens change from the front now 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.290
 nothing can come away and now everyone 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.750
 really perfect behind us is one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.159
 ship and I want to go now 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.570
 make really nice shots and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.570
 I wish you much fun to keep watching 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 really fun 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.920
 the special feature is that if the first 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.220
 Once upon a time you can see it is here too 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 equal to an ergonomic cuts 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.790
 really thought of everything now if 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 you want to quickly make a shot 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.540
 you have installed here and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 zipper quasi and fast access 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.799
 can now easily the camera 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 make a nice picture and get out 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.940
 then speak the camera 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.610
 therefore stowing and doing so 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.990
 is of course always in contrast to the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.190
 I really get another bag 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.250
 great so I liked that 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.410
 The second big one is when he is here now 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 the photo bag opens is yes 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.470
 actually always so that you ask them 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 the whole in principle hanging up here 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.040
 has got really clever 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 Here one sees then comes on the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.680
 Accessory area here you still have 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.990
 a further fan should network professional 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.510
 He has several things where you can cool here 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.670
 one of their leaders and down 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.830
 So we can bring in principle 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 in the office area purely here 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.120
 and not on the photo main subject 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.660
 but the photo main subject that is yes 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 the beautiful open in this pocket 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.030
 here simply the back around then works 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.900
 the pocket forward of time so that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.320
 It's easy to get here to the people 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.190
 come and really has space 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.170
 and can work properly if you can 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.330
 all the others I have so far 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.400
 it was all works around here thats easy 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.880
 tip so that's really the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.640
 absolute 21 senses again noticed 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.640
 the bag is really something 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.999
 exactly I will now show just once 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.730
 The bag you can see here now 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.790
 Here I have my camera trained 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.200
 camera with manuscripts are extra theirs 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.650
 recesses where you can be objectively 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 You can work out where you are in two 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.269
 levels according to the things 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.879
 can accommodate as you get 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.400
 without problems the lenses under and 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.689
 then you always have something upstairs 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.439
 the times, the times so show me here 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.780
 a handle with camera if 70 200 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.189
 28 so the feedback what you accordingly 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.319
 needs then somebody fits 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:57.669
 second camera purely then you can see here well 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.689
 So that's great the chamber 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.489
 also drop 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.560
 Therefore, it is also the same above 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.969
 to blame a choice so there 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.069
 nothing can happen is happy 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:12.430
 that's exactly what you can do 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.379
 accordingly and clean the subjects 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.349
 so you could add another four now 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.400
 Objectives would therefore be that would be 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.400
 no problem 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.150
 you have to do the bag as well 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.570
 save one else where you can and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.560
 then two small but I do that 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.560
 always so literally here 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.580
 You can here according to floor 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.500
 outside tracks please hang sufficiently guilty 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.680
 to belong where you then speak that 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.930
 several bottles and and objectively heard 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.220
 So you can pocket without problems 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.130
 even though he probably is expanding 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:07.570
 in the end, everything is just crazy 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:11.250
 fit in two ways that I like 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:15.330
 my favorite at the little book 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.800
 Tripod I here in front 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.540
 that will help you then you can do it 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.390
 Wear it well if you have a bigger one 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.920
 There is also a city ​​area here 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.070
 they thought they are so echoing here 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.670
 Believe best to speak the loops 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.650
 makes dirless by terrible with 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.930
 not so first and then comes here 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.630
 tripod turn and an occupied one can 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.940
 others do not run fix so that 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.460
 also different sizes with me 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.880
 can is down so it also there 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.880
 Perfect 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.470
 that's why, of course, now 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.180
 important our materials too 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.090
 wenderoth corners are but inside 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.130
 rubber but of course you have the advice 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.870
 the zippers and set to music but 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.150
 is there already on you have this 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.500
 simply speak with the conclusion that 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.480
 rain no problem-we absolutely 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.280
 protected europe will not do any 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.580
 problem hit her behind 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.960
 i had nice flute from mafia 2 's 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.490
 stowed 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.400
 We also have a good change 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.640
 Clearly the discourse so you have now 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.410
 Here once this question is really 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.720
 quite important when looking at that 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.600
 Tripod work I have the piece is 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.160
 the matter on the tripod complaining days 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.110
 So hang so that in principle there 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.690
 also directly above pure business and 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.340
 stabilizes really really nice 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.170
 and then you have just about every normal 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.570
 strap and here it is 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.780
 Waist belt the principle of the weight of the 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.430
 then redirects a shoulder and 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.880
 one on the fifth 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.470
 that means one has integrated so that in the 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.020
 principle the court is all here 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.880
 Once on the shoulder is so 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:05.530
 Overall , I would a trauma bag yes 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.090
 that was actually quite gray and 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.080
 hopefully you liked and bought here 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.180
 this bag 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.540
 I wish you a lot of fun and see you 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540
 next time
