on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> surface<00:01:42.020> I'm<00:01:43.020> sure<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> are

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
on the surface I'm sure a lot of you are

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.740 
on the surface I'm sure a lot of you are
familiar<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:45.149> you've<00:01:45.270> been<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.540> bath

familiar with if you've been in the bath

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.679 
familiar with if you've been in the bath
and<00:01:46.079> using<00:01:46.380> bars<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.979> soap<00:01:47.240> I'm<00:01:48.240> sure<00:01:48.450> you've

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and using bars of soap I'm sure you've

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.710 
and using bars of soap I'm sure you've
seen<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.619> tide<00:01:50.520> markedness<00:01:51.060> come<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and that's basically due to the reaction

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
and that's basically due to the reaction
of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> hardness<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> water<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.740> the

dry skin conditions you imagine you're

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.479 
dry skin conditions you imagine you're

into<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:10.680> hands<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.489> can<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.030> trigger

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239

that<00:03:12.359> triggers<00:03:13.170> off<00:03:13.320> dry<00:03:13.530> skin<00:03:13.799> conditions

that triggers off dry skin conditions

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.069 
that triggers off dry skin conditions
such<00:03:14.310> as<00:03:14.489> eczema<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.720> use<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> water

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
such as eczema so if you use a water

softener<00:03:16.440> you're<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.579> get<00:03:17.670> that

off that phone almost immediately and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.000 
off that phone almost immediately and
you<00:04:30.120> can<00:04:30.240> see<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.510> water<00:04:30.720> started<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.470> go<00:04:31.650> very

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
you can see the water started to go very

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.040 
you can see the water started to go very
slightly<00:04:32.310> cloudy<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.780> used<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:33.990> be

slightly cloudy and that used to be

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.610 
slightly cloudy and that used to be
buried
