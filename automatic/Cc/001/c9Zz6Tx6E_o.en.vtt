00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:14.049
 my mirror is needed 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:18.400
 here is just awkward how much 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:23.789
 to myself equipped myself right now here myself and 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 slightly lower 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 so at first still have me say 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.470
 how convenient are you uncomfortable volumes 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 the tire is what like to start that is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.090
 how to stop thinking about the version as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.330
 female in my understanding yes what are you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 like the first thing you like a woman 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.280
 I do not know the needs 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.600
 406 which are supposedly apparently not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:58.530
 female quite satisfied I do not know just 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.949
 small of course but enough hormones 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 doorway 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.070
 places 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.000
 you can open them first 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.000
 especially like 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.440
 big don't you know what to call it 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.140
 team bun option 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.600
 just what what what is karma like 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 need something else like her 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.820
 controlled light steering heavy weapons 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:37.630
 sit comfortably yes yes sit here very much 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 lucky lucky luckier than me so don't 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.430
 like then with what you like in 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 principle on the track well yes it is bad 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.690
 all that does not like very much gets wet 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.690
 comfortable trunk 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.570
 but if you open, you nail for something 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.720
 no special claims clean 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.170
 car in general, then no, yes, that's just 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.420
 that's it 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.970
 fixing the mirror in an incomprehensible position 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.480
 a friend who never wants 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.150
 fixed in need for man i 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.250
 not even he fixed 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.900
 I think this is a feature of all cars. 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.060
 here the latch stand on the idea can be 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.129
 they are shifted coiled principle here 500 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:35.299
 the adventure is just everyone else 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:35.299
 radio switch 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.829
 what else do you say and when you sit on 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.790
 passenger seat and very helpful 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.219
 by saying 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.499
 grew done blowing eyes resource less 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.749
 this little one has to and and 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.159
 send more to the driver like this 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.829
 here I am sitting in the driver's seat now 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.180
 I like the eye not to think that is, if 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.349
 great though she directed 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.799
 seemingly right here 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.120
 but if i'm sitting on the passenger 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.719
 average enough 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.200
 to start the water street yes no game 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.200
 hear 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.010
 Now, as soot you do not just 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.260
 at ease 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.549
 legs and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.550
 true feet falls on there 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.810
 thrust 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.330
 still 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.230
 hiding 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.230
 the city started up badly 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.930
 I should not on principle 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:45.069
 hide on the couch at all 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.700
 almost 406 yes there wheel burns out 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.700
 whether what 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.850
 these passengers are generally just 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.850
 relax yourself enjoy yourself 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.510
 principle for the driver here too 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:38.230
 don't know the rearview mirror 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.230
 found out that it is someone else's 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.320
 give a rearview mirror in it 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.660
 it looks like an old car presented 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.490
 here the windshield and rear mirrors 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.370
 species is slightly higher than it should be 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.449
 he fits perfectly 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.180
 window but it can be seen in the ground 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:06.760
 teacher, I sit below so I see 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.350
 on this earth and me 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.000
 I would like to see more because I 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.409
 I see 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.319
 car face still visible 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.319
 and to see and more will increase 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.270
 Well, I don’t see anything at all 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:25.300
 rear mirrors only 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.590
 took the side rear view 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.110
 that is, I think it’s rather all 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:45.909
 really because of you rearranged 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:48.479
 flowed illiterately blocks so there is no dilly 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.479
 where are you flying 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.099
 I'll see you 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.930
 our neighbor is actually
