00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.530
 Hello dear friends with you a mans 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.660
 and without departing from the ticket office to tell you in 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.570
 this video is needed or a stylus for iphone 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.430
 and eating ipod touch 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.590
 let's start in principle why do 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.380
 I need a stylus at all I think 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.220
 stylus most let's me by the way 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.690
 make it smaller so the stylus is better 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.030
 also seems to me again for 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.059
 artists draw on ebay.de 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.430
 who needs it, that is, if rubles 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.020
 previous videos that is yes let's give it 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.030
 can be cleaned but i can say it again 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:06.380
 not an artist and shortcut and 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.350
 draw something she let's let the water 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.479
 there is some ship I do not know the ship 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.479
 Anyway let's say Prague 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.140
 a plain crowd let's pipe from here 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:22.100
 im et cetera i'm not an artist 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.320
 after 100 it will eat well, but it can still 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 be a program unsuitable let's say here 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 I will give 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:36.679
 In principle, he programs although cool from 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.799
 have time to press can be made on lived to 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.899
 opacity 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:47.429
 radius and rigidity and here we get something 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:51.319
 Like this you can write 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.319
 something a la heat 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.500
 something like here so here like love with 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.290
 galaxy music or do so here in 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.030
 In principle , this is the stylus 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.590
 look previous arc called to me 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.390
 and number five is polina yes and where I told 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.710
 about cleaning but let's go back to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.350
 questions do you need it 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:31.360
 figure in general for the usual user 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.820
 i have a foot he added that music i 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.430
 I enjoyed a couple of days when we are not here 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.070
 gonna come and just stupid 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 abandoned because you know but right there 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.690
 the letter is right some sense that these 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.400
 extra hands up our always with us and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.980
 in principle, it is really more convenient for them 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.920
 periotek troubles but when you draw 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.010
 draw u let's finger there it is not 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.530
 too comfortable to know how to say 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.100
 the same stylus ie stylus 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.770
 Comfortably set off, in principle, not for 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.020

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.000
