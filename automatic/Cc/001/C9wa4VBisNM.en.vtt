00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello friends on our channel 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.140
 question and background questions such that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 the young man is in the process 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:22.480
 obtain political asylum from him 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.830
 assigned somewhere about the interview and he or 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.330
 court but there is something so mean and lawyer 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.779
 his says that even from the countries there on 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.729
 the court will not slip through his permission 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.420
 at night you can renew each 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:38.409
 year he will have a work permit and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.479
 really because while people are in 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.729
 process there they have not from day one but 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.859
 in about a year, that's how they came 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:48.399
 a work permit occurs but for now 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:51.399
 they're not yet there is the process of 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.530
 obtain political asylum and here it is 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.420
 asks that's what he says here i want 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.459
 come and study there let's say 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.729
 test software 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:03.309
 good and then I have to go look 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.950
 work and that's when I'm going to look for work 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.770
 will I have problems with that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.260
 I'm not green card is not nationality but 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 some strange such status some 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.470
 work permit every year 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.480
 need to sell and whether it will not hurt me 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.120
 don't i take me away 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.260
 network 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.480
 I want to say that there is 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.120
 still a legal aspect consisting in 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.100
 that if there is a right to work then it 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.070
 there is in the company in this sense not 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.230
 finger of course if the whole company is there 2 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.240
 human 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.160
 the boss there thinks well his nafig there 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.230
 it is not known what is there when 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.670
 he may not be renewed next year and 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.480
 so on then i mean let it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.250
 imagine but but in general it's a miser on 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.740
 compared to the fact that basically nobody 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.060
 will not pay attention is and is now 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.490
 here's another moment depending on where 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.950
 you are in the United 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.190
 states there are places where people 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.420
 non-frightened for example i will tell you that in 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.900
 silicon valley mid 90s when from 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 Visa hiv water there give not yet been so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.550
 massive and many shy say well 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.500
 his nafig we will not make him this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.920
 water or talked there we won't do 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.370
 transfer or now the opposite is true for many 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 I didn’t want to open 1 1 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.380
 so here it is specifically here with silicon 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.010
 the valley 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.650
 personnel departments are accustomed 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.610
 absolutely my shot of him 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.920
 the diversity of what are 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.820
 work permits you absolutely nobody 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.769
 surprise and nothing so here 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.850
 for example, yes, I told you that 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.209
 nothing to worry about 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.800
 if you find yourself somewhere I don't know 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.560
 even where I’m afraid with my finger here on the map 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.020
 where are the people virgin such a game then that 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:10.740
 this 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:13.450
 Well, I don ` t know what to say 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.890
 I suspect that there are no special problems either 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.920
 will be to the extent that you have there 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.010
 documents he roughly speaking conditionally with 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.070
 print that is, he is official here 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.840
 print no time cache and they will look or 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.050
 There in extremely sound googling or its 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.760
 the directory will look there I really do not know I 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.780
 never met you had problems 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.090
 never have a significant percentage of our 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.010
 students here is in this situation 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.050
 especially Russian-speaking students I'm not 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.050
 seen in such problems never so 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.340
 full speed ahead and can say and 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.810
 essentially not to be afraid to do and not 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.940
 fear and as if the truth is on your side 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.370
 yes you have a legal right 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.620
 let's it is worth it if you 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.560
 the right to such a thing does not happen 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.120
 it is one thing and when the right is completely legal 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.210
 different and even more so if you are in a country where 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.000
 it means right respected I remember 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.970
 Palite words such anecdote old 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.180
 soviet as all is worth 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.900
 equal to titus spit and man out of turn 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.490
 goes to recite mate us here turn 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 says nomia IDs will show 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.290
 identity as i am entitled without 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.910
 queues are rich but after all the whole queue 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.770
 of those who have the right without turn these 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.590
 In America, this is not supposed to get 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.570
 so its and as a general rule 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.320
 specifically you can run into all that 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.030
 anything but you don't need there out of ten 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.720
 interview 10 works wanna do is this the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.580
 interview there is one job per specific 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.510
 point in time with this problem should not 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.510
 be among
