00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.999
 Hello Haste already heard of her best competition 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.480
 the course is a great thing but four animals secret data do not go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970
 four paws would like 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.630
 that the attitude of wild animals in the circus 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.429
 finally be banned 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.400
 and went for the street 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 Here are some impressions of Hans Aktion Store 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.460
 and then it started 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.200
 Girl in the crowd 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 show that ecclesiastical are not failures 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 Maybe you are not all in a cage right now 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.450
 but we can say 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.240
 however tight 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520
 not the choice 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.730
 "You should not have had any way to do this by any one of the Frechen 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.570
 but that's exactly what this is about 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 to show that imitate have no place in the circus 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.620
 But we did not just want to be in circulation with money 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.430
 our goal was to get into conversation with people 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.170
 As much noise as possible should sign red cards 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 UL they had 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.150
 with everyone in the preparation 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.000
 just never stay 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 because everyone wanted Kate Moss is a protest against wildlife in the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 circus 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.090
 many clients will 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.580
 why kids elephants and the others do not belong in the circus of course 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.259
 also the press 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.879
 so far too few are thinking about such things 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.239
 but the most important thing for us was the signatures, the good cards 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.489
 As I said, every messenger counts Korte 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 and people need our opinion 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.099
 many have signed 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.469
 who in between want the coupÃ©-cabriolet 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.229
 We may have offered to stay at home stay tuned 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.019
 the stage over the internet threatened his cards 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.659
 there is
