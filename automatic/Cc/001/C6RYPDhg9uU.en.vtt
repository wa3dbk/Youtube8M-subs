 good evening participants before giving 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 the return I want to make a couple of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.070
 questions you allow me marcelo the and if 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.840
 There are several galas and several programs of 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.050
 television that you retire crying 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.240
 what is wrong with you 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.830
 well if something happens to me but there's no 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.140
 depression you see, they sell me practically 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.880
 like he's already alive if they're putting us 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.070
 Mattresses down my balcony by the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.740
 You doubt me but that's not going to 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.170
 happen really young very strong 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.910
 that I do not know how it happens to the rest of the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.950
 people that out there are more than one 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.170
 dancing but really as he says 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'm a hairdresser and I 'm 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.940
 happy to be a hairdresser and this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 overflowing is a kind of joy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.010
 of emotions 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.989
 I do not want to victimize myself because 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.269
 I already said I already heard paint my mouth and 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 get titties is not that victim 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.450
 it was 30 years ago now victim is the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.280
 guy who comes to the house and they're going to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.260
 hit a rocket the one that does not have to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 let's eat talk let's talk about 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.739
 What's wrong with you? I say because the other 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.420
 day in the sentence or while there was a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.000
 cut you went to cry behind the curtain 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.769
 you left the sun twice crying that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.879
 they stop you from some emotions but they are 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.799
 emotions that have nothing to do with the 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.780
 sadness that you have with depression ni 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.420
 nothing is a way to prove is like 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.069
 there are people who laugh and get caught 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.470
 I'm not getting caught, I hope I'm not 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.200
 happen but meanwhile what I 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.419
 it happens now are this molds tears 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.909
 but it's not for nothing especially with 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.620
 clear clear qaida of you with exactly 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.900
 it's a kind of catharsis that I'm 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.700
 doing but clearly I feel is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.980
 true that I feel lonely I come to 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.629
 my house and I am neither a clown nor a 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.400
 clown who comes to the house I close the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.439
 door and he starts to cry and he takes 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.030
 sleeping pills to sleep nothing more 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.319
 far from that because I have a life in the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.730
 which I have to get up at 5 o'clock 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.889
 tomorrow to go to the radio I have to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.280
 keep working I am the support of my 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.319
 own life 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.640
 also somehow the support of 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.590
 Rodrigo who is the boy for whom the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.330
 sleep is bra of gabo the bra 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 let's say, but not because I keep it 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.020
 the gabo bra because it's a 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.140
 professional dance and sometimes I feel 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.819
 that when he makes all the effort what 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.470
 I make it dull and that's a 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.630
 responsibility that comes to me in five 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.000
 minutes on the track later does not happen to me 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.639
 It also happens to me that I have the feeling 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.889
 of abc to be occupying a place that 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.840
 belongs to someone who was prepared 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.030
 who studied who worked for this and not 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 he has it and when I do not get it right 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.480
 things or tried to put all the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.580
 effort and did not succeed 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.650
 I feel that it gives me the opportunity to 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.660
 marcelo to the possibility that gives me this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.480
 track and everything you give me that 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 I have absolutely nothing more than 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.380
 respect and admiration for each one of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.850
 I say it wholeheartedly and it is not 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.100
 because someone does not care about anything that 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.080
 put a one but since I was little 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.160
 from seeing it from my house from seeing it 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.570
 as big as my house 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.580
 transform me into the life that I am 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.620
 Seeing you for as much as they tell me 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.200
 what they say to me I take it all 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.610
 respect and that I really tell you 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.379
 then at the time of standing here 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.530
 they are a lot of things that I want 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.210
 demonstrate and I do not know how it overflows me 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.120
 I want to thank I want to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.860
 embrace love I already want to why 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.330
 understand that you yourselves I do not know if 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.120
 being there you realize you are 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.129
 idols we grew up we educated ourselves and 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.259
 we turn on a television every day 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.150
 who knows with what reality each one of 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.879
 the Argentines from his house and he sees it 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.550
 you then at the moment of being here 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.129
 I feel that I really am the worker 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.050
 from this story I tell you from the heart and 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.539
 that's what happens to me but it does not happen 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.210
 nothing is nothing and it is all at the same 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.900
 weather 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.120
 good 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.490
 so they can see the good part of 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.530
 this show what this program leaves 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.210
 in my humble place in Gary let's make a 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.860
 some therapy saw when we come 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.389

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.720
 professional order us 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.250
 that's good, I'll leave for 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560
 another opportunity because it seems good and 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.479
 it's worth what the boy said in 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.550
 twitter saying that she is a healer 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.740
 It was full of dinosaurs intended 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.340
 leave room for new generations to 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.930
 grow 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.050
 I do not know if you want marcelo claure we have or 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.139
