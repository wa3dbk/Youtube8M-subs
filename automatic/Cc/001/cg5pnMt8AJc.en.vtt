trying to practice the fact that they're
inviting<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> contract<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.950> they<00:02:25.070> get<00:02:25.190> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
inviting the contract so that they get a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.800 
inviting the contract so that they get a
three-point<00:02:25.700> play<00:02:25.760> instead<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.420> two

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
three-point play instead of just two

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.260 
three-point play instead of just two
points<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:28.280> hard<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.700> practice<00:02:28.880> that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
points it's hard to practice that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.790 
points it's hard to practice that
one-on-one<00:02:29.630> because<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.710> get

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
one-on-one because you have to get

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.530 
one-on-one because you have to get
somebody<00:02:31.010> doing<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.490> any<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.390> go

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
somebody doing that any of you just go

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.050 
somebody doing that any of you just go
you're<00:02:32.900> also<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.010> practice<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:34.700> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
you're also but in practice I think you

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.530 
you're also but in practice I think you
know<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.360> think<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.690> lot<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.900> our<00:02:36.200> extra<00:02:36.920> shots

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
know you think a lot of our extra shots

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.660 
know you think a lot of our extra shots
holy<00:02:38.540> cow<00:02:38.960> maybe<00:02:39.440> especially<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.460> guy<00:02:40.640> like

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
holy cow maybe especially a guy like

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.420 
holy cow maybe especially a guy like
atmosphere<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.570> think<00:02:41.920> you've<00:02:42.920> got<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.130> give<00:02:43.400> a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
atmosphere I think you've got to give a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.310 
atmosphere I think you've got to give a
lot<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> expect<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.330> display<00:02:44.750> he<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:45.110> shoot

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
lot of expect to display he can shoot

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.300 
lot of expect to display he can shoot
well<00:02:45.560> from<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.890> outside

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
well from the outside

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.700 
well from the outside
he<00:02:46.760> drives<00:02:47.030> very<00:02:47.390> well<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.960> hoop<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.590> he

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
he drives very well to the hoop and he

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.140 
he drives very well to the hoop and he
should<00:02:48.860> prevent<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.310> free-throw<00:02:49.760> shooter

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
should prevent this free-throw shooter

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.260 
should prevent this free-throw shooter
when<00:02:51.080> he<00:02:51.170> has<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> lot<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.560> quality<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.610> think

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
when he has a lot of quality so I think

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.390 
when he has a lot of quality so I think
he's<00:02:53.420> improvement<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:54.320> only<00:02:54.620> came<00:02:54.860> because

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
he's improvement but only came because

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.970 
he's improvement but only came because
it<00:02:55.910> was<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.330> poor<00:02:56.600> but<00:02:56.990> because<00:02:57.110> he<00:02:57.320> practical

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
it was in poor but because he practical

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.599 
it was in poor but because he practical
