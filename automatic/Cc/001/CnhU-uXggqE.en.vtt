00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hey people what's up and effect to mine 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 youtube channel at hardware lp in this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.000
 video I show you the 500 euro gaming 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.620
 pc and in the last video has expensive 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 gaming-pc stop by 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 the link is in the description and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 I only have one housing 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.150
 sharkoon vgs four meters decided because 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.640
 The case looks very chic and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 has a lot of room for graphics cards and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880
 big cpu cooler 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.779
 with the processor I have for the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 intelli 4340 decided that a very 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.579
 strong processor as and very much 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 has two times 3.6 times 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 gigahertz with four slots so you could 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 in theory say it is a 4 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.879
 Kerner while mainboard have the svp 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.579
 85 m per 4 decided with the intel 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 chips b 480 s has ddr3 socket 1150 dual 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.340
 channel ddr3 up to 1600 has a 7.1 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 sound chip and the memory 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.939
 I have chosen the crucial ballistix 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.030
 sports ddr3 1600 the tl 90 kit 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.930
 decided with 8 gb at the graphic 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 have only two variants for me 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.350
 decided 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 one for the gcx 660 and once for the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.580
 again 270 here at the gtx 660 you have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 two gigabytes and it is rather a very 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.509
 strong graphics card so with the pc if 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.119
 you used the gtx 660 like that 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.500
 approximately with very high settings 38 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.390
 to 45 fps in the game far cry 4 and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.979
 in the new call of duty airways throwers 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.579
 you have more than 60 fps and in 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 assassin's creed ii unity you have 32 40 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.710
 fps in poles settings so that's 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.829
 something in the current game 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.090
 been patched so a second 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.580
 I already have a variant on it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.510
 hinted that it is an app 9 270 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 and she also has 2 gb ram pci 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.020
 express 3.0 us also a very strong 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.960
 graphic card 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.390
 she is three euros cheaper and it is one 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.700
 a little better so in my opinion 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.130
 I would take the arms now but it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.930
 has left you because some are 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.670
 nvidia some 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.990
 That's why I kicked two times 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.310
 packed here and and the diet 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.160
 270 has 49 54 fps though settings 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 Just grab it and that's all right 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.950
 good and in call of duty windsurfers have 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.890
 her more 60 fps with the app 1970 in very 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.520
 high attitudes in Assassin's creed 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.790
 unity you have with the r9 270 26 to 31 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.250
 it does so in high settings 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 not much fun and yes in the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.610
 hard drive I have for the entry 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 work won the lot was decided 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.190
 from seagate barracuda is the hard drive 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.900
 very fast and 1000 gigabytes should 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.540
 enough for most people 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.830
 in this power supply I am for 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.500
 the 530 election day hamburg decided 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.959
 80plus and this power adapter is easy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.209
 mega you can say what you want yes 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:28.510
 how cross better and what is called how 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.030
 first, second , more expensive 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.790
 this network because very quiet here very much 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.769
 quietly in operation even in full load 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.970
 So you can not go wrong 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.709
 Thank you for watching, I hope you 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.160

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.380
 just write questions in the comments 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.600
 synonymous in the last video I synonymous per 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.670
 private message ii get from some

 watch where you asked me yes 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.570
 how do you know which graphics card well 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 and bad or which cpu is good and 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.590
 bad and i would also about it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.610
 make a video if you are interested 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.720
