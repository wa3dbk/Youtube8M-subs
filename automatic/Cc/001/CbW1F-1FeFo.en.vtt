00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so now that we've got our butterfly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
so now that we've got our butterfly
finger<00:01:24.630> picks<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.289> thumb<00:01:25.469> pick<00:01:25.679> I<00:01:25.920> think

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
finger picks on and thumb pick I think

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.709

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:40.309 
you'll notice the difference in the
sound<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.929> go

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
sound so there you go

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.429 
sound so there you go
butterfly<00:01:41.039> fix<00:01:41.659> I'll<00:01:42.659> probably<00:01:42.929> still<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
butterfly fix I'll probably still use a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.230 
butterfly fix I'll probably still use a
flat<00:01:43.709> pick<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.219> but<00:01:44.429> anytime<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.909> feel<00:01:45.090> like

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
flat pick a lot but anytime I feel like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.449 
flat pick a lot but anytime I feel like
going<00:01:45.479> finger<00:01:45.810> style<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.709> have<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> my

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459
