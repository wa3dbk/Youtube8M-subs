00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
a lot of fun I made one mistake that

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.409 
a lot of fun I made one mistake that
cost<00:00:01.890> us<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.340> think<00:00:02.370> it<00:00:02.669> possibly<00:00:02.939> cost<00:00:03.149> us<00:00:03.300> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
cost us I think it possibly cost us the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.039 
cost us I think it possibly cost us the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
win we had new tires on and I was

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.780 
win we had new tires on and I was
fighting<00:00:07.410> pretty<00:00:07.649> hard<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.099> outside<00:00:08.309> to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
fighting pretty hard on that outside to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.780 
fighting pretty hard on that outside to
try<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> maintain<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.380> position<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.580> get

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
try to maintain the position and get

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.509 
try to maintain the position and get
gains<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.330> positions<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.679> got<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:14.099> high<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519

kind of at the bottom and went up to the
to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.540> top<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.570> guys<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.409> smoking

to the top and you know guys are smoking

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
to the top and you know guys are smoking
the<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.460> rear<00:01:32.640> tire<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.299> those<00:01:33.450> things

so<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.930> referring<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
so that that's what I'm referring to you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
so that that's what I'm referring to you
know<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.729> comparison<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.799> because<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
know is a comparison and because the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319 
know is a comparison and because the
rubber<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.340> laid<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rubber got laid down on that that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.389 
rubber got laid down on that that
smoother<00:01:42.960> concrete<00:01:43.649> that's<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.250> what

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
smoother concrete that's that's what

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
smoother concrete that's that's what
allowed<00:01:44.759> us<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
allowed us to do that it had a lot of

they're<00:03:52.660> battling<00:03:52.959> for<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.200> win<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:54.040> was

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
they're battling for the win and it was

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.580 
they're battling for the win and it was
not<00:03:54.310> easy<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.670> pass<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.450> think<00:03:55.720> they<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.560> I

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
not easy to pass and I think they that I

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.320 
not easy to pass and I think they that I
guess<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.610> what<00:03:57.760> they<00:03:57.790> were<00:03:57.940> trying<00:03:58.209> to

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
guess that's what they were trying to

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.600 
guess that's what they were trying to
accomplish<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.050> know<00:03:59.080> was<00:03:59.410> make<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.340> harder

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
accomplish you know was make it harder

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.130 
accomplish you know was make it harder
to<00:04:00.640> pass<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.209> had<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.540> kind<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.810> bump<00:04:02.020> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
to pass so you had to kind of bump the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.020 
to pass so you had to kind of bump the
guy<00:04:02.260> out<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.530> way<00:04:02.650> there's<00:04:03.459> no<00:04:03.520> more<00:04:03.790> bump

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
guy out of the way there's no more bump

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.300 
guy out of the way there's no more bump
and<00:04:04.209> run<00:04:04.360> but<00:04:04.660> there's<00:04:04.930> definitely<00:04:05.170> plenty<00:04:06.070> of

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.170 
made several slide jobs and I think I
completed<00:05:19.099> about<00:05:19.250> ninety<00:05:19.580> percent<00:05:19.729> of<00:05:20.030> them

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
completed about ninety percent of them

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.969 
completed about ninety percent of them
but<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.930> ten<00:05:21.199> percent<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.740> didn't

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
but that ten percent that I didn't

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.879 
but that ten percent that I didn't

complete cost me you know quite a few

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.969 
complete cost me you know quite a few
positions<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:26.840> know<00:05:26.930> restarts<00:05:27.440> were<00:05:27.590> intense

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
positions you know restarts were intense

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.140 
positions you know restarts were intense
because<00:05:28.190> you're<00:05:28.430> down<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:28.759> around<00:05:28.910> the

because you're down there around the
bottom<00:05:29.510> outside<00:05:30.229> groove<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> preferred

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
bottom outside groove is the preferred

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.120 
bottom outside groove is the preferred
