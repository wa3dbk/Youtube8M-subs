00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
of around around the bend on this unit

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.250 
of around around the bend on this unit
here<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.000> starting<00:00:47.300> off<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.629> left-hand<00:00:48.050> side

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
remove this entire module come out and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.560 
remove this entire module come out and
snap<00:00:57.019> in<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.500> spacer<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.790> keep<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.180> weight

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570

down<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.019> one<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.409> pros<00:01:00.589> I<00:01:00.739> thought<00:01:00.920> about

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
down but one of the pros I thought about

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.219 
down but one of the pros I thought about
this<00:01:01.190> machine<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:01.550> its<00:01:01.970> it's<00:01:02.390> well<00:01:02.629> balanced

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
this machine is its it's well balanced

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.480 
this machine is its it's well balanced
it's<00:01:04.129> got<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.430> lot<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.030> features<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's got a lot of features to it and the

it's got a lot of features to it and the
battery<00:01:07.820> life<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.119> pretty<00:01:08.270> good<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:08.659> don't

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
battery life is pretty good but I don't

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.690 
battery life is pretty good but I don't
life<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:08.990> got<00:01:09.110> even<00:01:09.229> 3<00:01:09.590> hours<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.979> use<00:01:10.310> out<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.550> it

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

on the Wacom brand it's actually that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.139 
on the Wacom brand it's actually that
technology<00:01:25.490> in<00:01:25.670> here

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
technology in here

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.389 
technology in here
and<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.899> had<00:01:27.080> one<00:01:27.320> quibble<00:01:27.740> with<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.070> unit

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
and if I had one quibble with this unit

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.090 
and if I had one quibble with this unit
it<00:01:28.490> would<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:29.179> daily<00:01:29.479> use<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:30.950> going

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
it would be for daily use this is going

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.380 
it would be for daily use this is going
to<00:01:31.159> get<00:01:31.310> either<00:01:31.460> broken<00:01:31.789> or<00:01:32.000> it's<00:01:32.149> gonna<00:01:32.240> get

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
to get either broken or it's gonna get

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.020 
to get either broken or it's gonna get
really<00:01:32.600> worn<00:01:32.929> because<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.800> kind<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.190> it's<00:01:34.819> made

it<00:02:05.750> also<00:02:05.899> has<00:02:06.319> USB<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.429> modem<00:02:07.879> which<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.209> all

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
it also has USB a modem which not all

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.690 
it also has USB a modem which not all
laptops<00:02:08.899> come<00:02:09.289> with<00:02:09.319> modems<00:02:09.679> anymore<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.250> on

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
laptops come with modems anymore and on

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.070 
laptops come with modems anymore and on
the<00:02:10.789> bottom<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.450> thing<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.750> actually<00:02:11.989> has

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the bottom of this thing it actually has

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080 
the bottom of this thing it actually has
a<00:02:12.110> docking<00:02:12.560> connector<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> could<00:02:13.910> see

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
a docking connector so I could see

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
standard things you see if I have a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.280 
standard things you see if I have a
small<00:02:35.060> quibble<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.660> would<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.080> track

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
small quibble on this would be the track

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.199 
small quibble on this would be the track
pod<00:02:36.530> trackpad<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.340> me<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> little<00:02:37.819> small

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
pod trackpad to me is a little small

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.930 
pod trackpad to me is a little small
yeah

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
yeah

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.280 
yeah
it's<00:02:40.120> got<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> feel<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.720> being<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.990> little<00:02:41.080> too

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it's got a feel of being a little too

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.110 
it's got a feel of being a little too
cramped<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.770> me<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.220> 19<00:02:42.700> book<00:02:42.910> which

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
cramped for me I was like 19 book which

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.180 
cramped for me I was like 19 book which
is<00:02:43.240> yeah<00:02:43.750> they're<00:02:44.380> quite<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> bit<00:02:44.710> on<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.830> Macbook

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is yeah they're quite a bit on a Macbook

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.500 
is yeah they're quite a bit on a Macbook
they<00:02:45.310> even<00:02:45.520> on<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.700> Toshiba<00:02:46.150> they're<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> bit

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
they even on the Toshiba they're a bit

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.790 
they even on the Toshiba they're a bit
bigger<00:02:46.690> than<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> one

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
bigger than this and that's the one

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.410 
bigger than this and that's the one
thing<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.980> would<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.760> does<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.240> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
thing I would think is it does have the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.450 
thing I would think is it does have the
speed<00:02:49.690> technology<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.560> speed<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.190> or

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
speed technology so you can speed up or

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.950 
speed technology so you can speed up or
slow<00:02:51.520> down<00:02:52.030> which<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.360> becoming<00:02:52.660> more<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
slow down which is becoming more and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.420 
slow down which is becoming more and
more<00:02:53.020> standard<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.220> has<00:02:54.400> a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
more standard and then this one has a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.290 
more standard and then this one has a
little<00:02:54.730> bit<00:02:54.820> more

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
little bit more

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.680 
little bit more
it<00:02:55.690> also<00:02:55.900> has<00:02:56.310> capacitive<00:02:57.310> multi-touch<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
it also has capacitive multi-touch so

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.030 
it also has capacitive multi-touch so
you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.990> actually<00:02:59.140> move<00:02:59.350> things<00:02:59.590> around<00:02:59.710> with

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
you can actually move things around with

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.490 
you can actually move things around with
your<00:03:00.250> fingers<00:03:00.580> I'll<00:03:01.270> allow<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.630> iPhone<00:03:02.140> iPod

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
your fingers I'll allow the iPhone iPod

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.930 
your fingers I'll allow the iPhone iPod

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
as the handwriting recognition gets

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.280 
as the handwriting recognition gets
better<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> better

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
better and better
