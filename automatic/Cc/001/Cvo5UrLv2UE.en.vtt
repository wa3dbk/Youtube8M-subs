00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:17.660
 a radio deejay and tropical pizza pizza in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:31.759
 tropical form dead people 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:33.980
 around like the normal pigeons that one 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.150
 says now that there is shuffolato intel e 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.410
 maybe the tropicalist goes into 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.440
 pilgrimage see the places of 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.400
 chocolate is also desired but 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.460
 Africa continues 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.559
 pilgrimage look for the places of the altarpiece 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.089
 tropical places that often and willingly 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.730
 coincide with those that william 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.649
 suggests in its website unusual tourism 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:00.140
 point it net point I remember more 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:01.969
 william global do not feel the first 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 time when we hear welcome back to the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.320
 parÃ  tropical today we also talk about 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.450
 music in logic because we talk about 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.119
 a score speaks of a score and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.470
 which is divided I would say because the score 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.940
 of the devil but you mean that of the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.500
 aaron who does 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.170
 exactly the one won in the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.090
 fourteenth century 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.020
 then a cover number the beast degli 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.990
 iron maiden 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.159
 we did a scoop of who you are 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.550
 taken seriously 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.070
 since then seriously today will lead you into 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.990
 a very small principality that is found 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.470
 in the province of vercelli and is called the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.450
 however, the principality of lights is today a limit 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 so immediately to talk about the related mysteries 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.159
 to this place that is so 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.229
 in the summer immersed in the rice fields but 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.820
 ominously shrouded in mist 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.509
 during the winter 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.539
 so much so that there was a historian of the xiii 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.039
 century that coming in these places 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.380
 he commented saying to the sight of a 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.300
 hanged hanging from the branch of a tree 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.959
 this swamp would certainly not hurt 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:12.910
 that the landscape frisk eating the name 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.450
 of a very peculiar hunch because in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.160
 himself is the union of light and me 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 lucedio but can also be attributed 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 to the brighter angel, that is lucifer 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 attention the exact rebel angel and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.200
 own lucifer 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.239
 so in this case a presence 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.980
 demonic bring us back to one of the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.310
 most famous companies in Italy that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.180
 precisely the devil's score 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.950
 and quiet in short we are in full 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.590
 Middle Ages this must be said 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.050
 we are certainly in the middle ages and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.000
 in fact it is said of within the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.950
 crypt of the abbey of santa maria di 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.380
 Lucedio was trapped the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.140
 malign presence thanks to a magic 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.420
 score composed on one side this 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.239
 note sequence is indeed capable of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.810
 block the demon at the same time as 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.540
 release it if played backwards 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.180
 right then the tune is born as 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.209
 almost a sort of exorcism if we want 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.269
 Exactly it served to block it at 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.000
 remain trapped in the sea 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.920
 inside the crypt attention 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.019
 because this score was searched 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.870
 this centuries because no one knew where 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.810
 pits was sought in the manuscripts but 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.690
 finally here it is because it was 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.299
 always been before everyone's eyes 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.340
 the curious thing is that it is a score 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.640
 palindrome notes can be heard in 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.950
 both senses and the trend we say 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.920
 so serious of the first three agreements leaves 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.959
 surely suppose that instead they are the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.239
 final notes and indeed if it is 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.970
 We play in a normal way to a 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.980
 a bit annoying melody if yes 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.109
 try to do it the other way ie from 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.650
 right to left and from bottom to 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.920
 the high has seen a harmonious sense e 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.310
 in fact this harmonic sense then 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.350
 would allow to release the excuse of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.120
 sam palindromo say that equal is in a 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.489
 meaning both in the other but in terms 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.430
 musical and how sandblasted it means 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.840
 that can sound in revenue or happen 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.519
 when you say palindrome of one 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.900
 score means that in short it makes sense 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.729
 both on one side and on the other for 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.440
 exactly eye the reverse version 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.120
 that otherwise is a moment that you will gather between 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.120
 cars in the year and the remix we are 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.960
 thanks, let's go look then 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.090
 what a devil's score about 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.830
 youtube and you will surely find it for 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.360
 this time only the original version then 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.610
 to disappear 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.860
 do not think that you also want to have 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.599
 more textual information that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.169
 that you take my tourism site now 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.629
 unusual dot com dot com 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.360
 I couldn't not do it I tried 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.520
 many times 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.289
 you know it true not to do this is the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.289
 just crazy 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.580
 Well
