the form of a kid it looks like

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.899 
the form of a kid it looks like
something<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:08.979> Tim<00:01:09.280> Burton<00:01:09.640> would<00:01:09.820> have

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
something that Tim Burton would have

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.260 
something that Tim Burton would have
drawn<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.920> really<00:01:12.430> creepy<00:01:12.970> looking

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
drawn and it's really creepy looking

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.640 
drawn and it's really creepy looking
actually<00:01:13.480> but<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.170> whole<00:01:14.320> point<00:01:14.350> of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
actually but the whole point of

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.560 
actually but the whole point of
disability<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.520> when<00:01:16.240> he's<00:01:16.390> actually

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
disability is when he's actually

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.660 
disability is when he's actually
fighting<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.590> oil<00:01:17.800> outside<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> body

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
fighting the oil outside of the body

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.460 
fighting the oil outside of the body
will<00:01:18.940> heat<00:01:19.210> up<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.660> that<00:01:19.960> will<00:01:20.080> cause<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
will heat up and that will cause the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.260 
will heat up and that will cause the
water<00:01:20.680> inside<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:21.220> his<00:01:21.340> body<00:01:21.370> to<00:01:21.760> evaporate

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
water inside of his body to evaporate

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.690 
water inside of his body to evaporate
thus<00:01:22.600> expanding<00:01:23.140> outwards<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.460> more<00:01:24.670> he

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
thus expanding outwards and the more he

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.480 
thus expanding outwards and the more he
fights<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.270> more<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.540> will<00:01:25.600> expand<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
fights the more it will expand and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.860 
fights the more it will expand and
essentially<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:27.670> creates<00:01:28.000> another<00:01:28.300> explosion

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
essentially it creates another explosion

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.900 
essentially it creates another explosion
which<00:01:29.470> again<00:01:29.740> will<00:01:29.950> create<00:01:30.250> all<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:30.670> rain

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
which again will create all of this rain

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.580 
which again will create all of this rain
and<00:01:31.240> he'll<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:31.510> repeat<00:01:31.900> it<00:01:32.020> all<00:01:32.170> again<00:01:32.440> as

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
and he'll just repeat it all again as

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.990 
and he'll just repeat it all again as
the<00:01:32.710> rain<00:01:32.860> comes<00:01:33.010> down<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.430> reforms<00:01:33.820> new

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
the rain comes down and reforms new

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.050 
the rain comes down and reforms new

then the clone of the music ah gay

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.670 
then the clone of the music ah gay
explodes<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:21.570> then<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.050> stops<00:03:22.410> halfway

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
explodes but then kind of stops halfway

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560 
explodes but then kind of stops halfway
because<00:03:23.070> gaara's<00:03:23.550> clones<00:03:23.820> started<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.299> seal

because gaara's clones started to seal
it<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.870> then<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.470> find<00:03:25.680> out<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.860> there<00:03:26.100> was

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
it and then we find out that there was

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.340 
it and then we find out that there was
actually<00:03:26.489> gold<00:03:26.730> dust<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.239> there<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
actually gold dust in there and as the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.039 
actually gold dust in there and as the
clone<00:03:28.799> was<00:03:29.070> cooling<00:03:29.820> off<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.570> know<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:30.900> and

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
clone was cooling off you know back and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.380 
clone was cooling off you know back and
forth<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.470> explodes<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.250> REE<00:03:32.489> REE<00:03:33.000> connects

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
forth is explodes and REE REE connects

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.800 
forth is explodes and REE REE connects
the<00:03:34.260> cooling<00:03:34.680> made<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> gold<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:36.090> lock<00:03:36.480> like

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the cooling made the gold like lock like

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.330 
the cooling made the gold like lock like
a<00:03:36.840> rock<00:03:37.140> around<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> can't<00:03:38.100> move

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
a rock around it and it can't move

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.340 
a rock around it and it can't move
anymore<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.420> clone<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
anymore and that clone is out and the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.880 
anymore and that clone is out and the
music<00:03:40.650> colleges<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.100> damn<00:03:41.880> son<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.890> that's

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
music colleges like damn son and that's

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.050 
music colleges like damn son and that's
how<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> chapter<00:03:44.430> pretty<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:44.700> comes<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
how the chapter pretty much comes to

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.780 
how the chapter pretty much comes to
inflows<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.650> by<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.549> just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
inflows and by the way this is not just

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.430 
inflows and by the way this is not just
a<00:03:47.880> chapter<00:03:48.239> review<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.660> also<00:03:48.900> doubles<00:03:49.110> as<00:03:49.380> a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
a chapter review it also doubles as a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.289 
a chapter review it also doubles as a
drinking<00:03:49.920> game<00:03:50.100> every<00:03:50.700> time<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.030> hear<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
drinking game every time you hear the

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.620 
drinking game every time you hear the
word<00:03:51.329> clone<00:03:51.780> take<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> drink<00:03:52.459> mmm<00:03:53.459> all<00:03:54.390> right

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
expect that his abilities would be this

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.270 
expect that his abilities would be this
intricate<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:09.120> well<00:04:09.329> thought<00:04:09.600> out<00:04:10.280> he

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
intricate in this well thought out he

and<00:05:00.979> then<00:05:01.070> come<00:05:01.250> back<00:05:01.280> down<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.729> do<00:05:01.789> it<00:05:01.880> again

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
and then come back down and do it again

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.909 
and then come back down and do it again
that's<00:05:02.240> just<00:05:02.330> ridiculous<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.440> almost<00:05:03.590> sounds

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
that's just ridiculous it almost sounds

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.100 
that's just ridiculous it almost sounds
like<00:05:03.949> something<00:05:04.280> out<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.400> one<00:05:04.639> piece<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:05.120> mean

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
like something out of one piece I mean

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.659 
like something out of one piece I mean
it<00:05:06.440> sounds<00:05:06.590> like<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.830> devil<00:05:07.010> fruit<00:05:07.310> ability

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
it sounds like a devil fruit ability

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.610 
it sounds like a devil fruit ability
it's<00:05:07.789> just<00:05:07.940> it's<00:05:08.120> insane<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.289> like<00:05:09.470> it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
it's just it's insane and I like it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.570 
it's just it's insane and I like it
though<00:05:09.710> because<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.979> shows<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.430> author

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
though because it shows that the author

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.219 
though because it shows that the author
is<00:05:10.729> still<00:05:11.240> being<00:05:11.389> really<00:05:11.600> really<00:05:11.690> creative

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
is still being really really creative

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.050 
is still being really really creative
