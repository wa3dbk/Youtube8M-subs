deprecation<00:04:53.580> shame<00:04:54.800> permeates<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.160> lives<00:04:56.370> of

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
deprecation shame permeates the lives of

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.860 
deprecation shame permeates the lives of
my<00:04:57.060> people<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:59.090> there<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:00.210> both<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.510> feeling<00:05:00.810> of

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
my people and there is both a feeling of

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.900 
my people and there is both a feeling of
helplessness<00:05:01.110> because<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.860> feel<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.490> want

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
helplessness because you feel you want

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.390 
helplessness because you feel you want
to<00:05:03.210> raise<00:05:04.080> them<00:05:04.350> beyond<00:05:04.650> all<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.190> lift

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
to raise them beyond all that and lift

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.070 
to raise them beyond all that and lift
them<00:05:05.550> up<00:05:05.669> and<00:05:05.880> then<00:05:06.120> there's<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.539> reality

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
them up and then there's the reality

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.990 
them up and then there's the reality
that<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.380> take<00:05:07.590> only<00:05:07.889> one<00:05:08.039> family<00:05:08.310> one<00:05:08.639> person

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
that you take only one family one person

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.120 
that you take only one family one person
at<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.180> time

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
at a time

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.330 
at a time
and<00:05:11.539> that's<00:05:12.539> where<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.750> serve<00:05:13.139> in<00:05:13.770> addition<00:05:14.220> to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.270 
working in Central City I give time and

probably should give more to to my

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.490 
probably should give more to to my
people<00:05:20.750> because<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.870> understand<00:05:22.320> their

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
people because I understand their

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.560 
people because I understand their
struggle<00:05:22.919> because<00:05:23.849> I've<00:05:24.000> been<00:05:24.240> there<00:05:24.450> and

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
struggle because I've been there and

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.120 
struggle because I've been there and
lived<00:05:24.810> among<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.229> and<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:25.680> that's<00:05:25.770> part<00:05:26.070> of

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
lived among it and so that's part of

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.500 
lived among it and so that's part of
what<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.340> do<00:05:27.979> but<00:05:28.979> yet<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.190> can't<00:05:29.940> help<00:05:30.000> but<00:05:30.240> see

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
what I do but yet I can't help but see

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.390 
what I do but yet I can't help but see
that<00:05:30.539> there<00:05:31.110> there<00:05:31.410> has<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.650> be<00:05:31.860> some

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
that there there has to be some

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.690 
that there there has to be some
connection<00:05:32.580> between<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.070> spirit<00:05:35.550> of

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
connection between the the spirit of

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.969 
connection between the the spirit of
awakening<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:36.660> liberating<00:05:37.260> and<00:05:37.380> empowering

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
awakening and liberating and empowering

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.879 
awakening and liberating and empowering
and<00:05:38.669> take<00:05:39.450> it<00:05:39.599> on<00:05:39.780> into<00:05:40.200> a<00:05:40.229> different<00:05:40.680> platform

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
and take it on into a different platform

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.890 
and take it on into a different platform
and<00:05:41.430> that's<00:05:41.610> why<00:05:41.849> I<00:05:41.880> think<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.210> Congress<00:05:42.690> is

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
and that's why I think the Congress is

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.270 
and that's why I think the Congress is
necessary

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
necessary

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.850 
necessary
it<00:05:45.150> becomes<00:05:45.540> necessary<00:05:45.750> because<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.590> brings

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
it becomes necessary because it brings

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.150 
it becomes necessary because it brings
together<00:05:47.960> different<00:05:48.960> groups<00:05:49.710> that<00:05:49.950> are<00:05:50.100> doing

together different groups that are doing
