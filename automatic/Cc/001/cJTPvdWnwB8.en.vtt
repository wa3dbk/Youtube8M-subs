are<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> couple<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.810> principles<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.739> drive

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
are a couple of principles that drive

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.110 
first let's talk about what a vessel
actually<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.799> how<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.459> define<00:02:30.910> the

principles for the navigational rules

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.110 
principles for the navigational rules
can<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.109> tell<00:03:44.319> us<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.560> little<00:03:44.590> bit<00:03:44.769> about

well the most important navigational

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.759 
well the most important navigational
