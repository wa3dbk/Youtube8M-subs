a little bit about the G what that
stands<00:00:02.159> for<00:00:02.250> it<00:00:02.520> stands<00:00:02.700> for<00:00:02.760> gold<00:00:04.310> Huawei<00:00:05.310> has

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
stands for it stands for gold Huawei has

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
stands for it stands for gold Huawei has
just<00:00:05.640> introduced<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.210> new<00:00:06.420> tiered<00:00:06.839> lettering

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
just introduced a new tiered lettering

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.459 
just introduced a new tiered lettering
system<00:00:08.490> or<00:00:08.700> all<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.120> its<00:00:09.389> new<00:00:09.570> phones<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
system or all of its new phones so you

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
system or all of its new phones so you
have<00:00:10.740> D<00:00:11.040> P<00:00:11.610> G<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.830> Y<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.580> essentially<00:00:14.910> G<00:00:15.210> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
have D P G and Y and so essentially G is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.019 
have D P G and Y and so essentially G is
the<00:00:15.509> third<00:00:15.750> tier<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.520> shouldn't<00:00:17.940> be

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the third tier so you shouldn't be

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.760 
the third tier so you shouldn't be
expecting<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:19.109> anything<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.619> the
