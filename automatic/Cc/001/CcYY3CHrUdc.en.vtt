00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
think is the best word for it just if

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.529 
think is the best word for it just if
you<00:00:23.250> look<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:23.609> what's<00:00:23.820> happened<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> guy

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that night and when he just teased that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.319

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
though that's not always the case that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
though that's not always the case that
wasn't<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> case<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.660> Rybak<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.410> wasn't

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760 
the case of Curtis axel sometimes you
win<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.520> sometimes<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> lose<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.770> but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
win some and sometimes you lose some but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.880

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I think a lot of people just looked at

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
I think a lot of people just looked at
that<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> said<00:00:55.079> well<00:00:55.320> Heyman<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> guy<00:00:56.370> who

Lesnar<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.280> beating<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> Undertaker<00:01:00.649> that's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
Lesnar in beating the Undertaker that's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
Lesnar in beating the Undertaker that's
a<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.160> deal<00:01:02.420> Heyman<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> associated

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a pretty big deal Heyman is associated

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.280 
a pretty big deal Heyman is associated
with<00:01:04.409> big<00:01:05.369> deals<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> big<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
with big deals and and big things so

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
with big deals and and big things so
putting<00:01:07.619> Cesaro<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.220> him<00:01:08.369> must<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> sign

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
putting Cesaro with him must be a sign

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.539 
putting Cesaro with him must be a sign
they<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.450> big<00:01:09.630> plans<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> guy<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> if

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
they have big plans for the guy and if

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.570 
they have big plans for the guy and if
they<00:01:11.700> did<00:01:12.000> plans<00:01:12.869> changed<00:01:13.439> because<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:14.340> was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
they did plans changed because there was

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
they did plans changed because there was
nothing<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.619> disappointment<00:01:16.619> after

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
nothing but disappointment after

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.560 
nothing but disappointment after
disappointment<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.240> took<00:01:18.390> away

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
disappointment you know they took away

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.030 
disappointment you know they took away
the<00:01:18.689> big<00:01:18.990> swing<00:01:19.290> which<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the big swing which was one of the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590 
the big swing which was one of the
things<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> made<00:01:20.520> him<00:01:20.670> popular<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.420> guess

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
things that made him popular and I guess

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
things that made him popular and I guess
the<00:01:21.750> logic<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.710> he's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> he's<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the logic there is well he's a he's a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
the logic there is well he's a he's a
bad<00:01:23.729> guy<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> swing<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> gonna

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
bad guy now and so the swing is gonna

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
bad guy now and so the swing is gonna
get<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> big<00:01:26.220> babyface<00:01:26.729> reaction<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:28.080> would

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
get a big babyface reaction and it would

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
get a big babyface reaction and it would
make<00:01:28.409> no<00:01:28.439> sense<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> guy<00:01:29.250> who's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> heel<00:01:30.020> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
make no sense for a guy who's a heel to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
make no sense for a guy who's a heel to
do<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> move<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.400> him

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
do a move that's going to get him

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.539 
do a move that's going to get him
cheered<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.320> if<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> logic<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
cheered so if that's the logic then I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.870 
cheered so if that's the logic then I
kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.299> although<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> still

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
kind of get it although you know I still

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
kind of get it although you know I still
think<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.270> stupid<00:01:39.659> though<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> strip<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
think it's stupid though to strip the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
think it's stupid though to strip the
guy<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.820> some<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> things<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> made<00:01:42.479> him

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
guy of some of the things that made him

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.520 
guy of some of the things that made him
popular<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.820> took<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.090> away<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:45.479> him

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
popular but they took that away from him

shows<00:03:27.480> up<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.780> next<00:03:27.990> night<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.380> basically

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
shows up the next night and basically

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.120 
shows up the next night and basically
the<00:03:29.040> implication<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.990> not<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.290> Cesaro<00:03:31.650> chose

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the implication is not that Cesaro chose

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.980 
the implication is not that Cesaro chose
to<00:03:32.310> leave<00:03:32.460> Heyman<00:03:32.820> on<00:03:32.940> his<00:03:33.090> own<00:03:33.300> but<00:03:33.750> rather

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
to leave Heyman on his own but rather

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.930 
to leave Heyman on his own but rather
Paul<00:03:34.650> Heyman<00:03:35.010> probably<00:03:35.310> just<00:03:35.460> cut<00:03:35.640> bait<00:03:35.820> on

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
Paul Heyman probably just cut bait on

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.650 
Paul Heyman probably just cut bait on
the<00:03:36.060> guy<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.540> he's<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> loser<00:03:38.150> no<00:03:39.150> build<00:03:39.480> up

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the guy because he's a loser no build up

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.390 
the guy because he's a loser no build up
to<00:03:39.870> an<00:03:39.990> eventual<00:03:40.230> story<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.130> Brock<00:03:41.370> Lesnar

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
to an eventual story with Brock Lesnar

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.750 
to an eventual story with Brock Lesnar
or<00:03:42.270> Cesaro<00:03:43.200> breaking<00:03:43.500> away<00:03:43.890> from<00:03:44.010> Heyman<00:03:44.640> on

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
or Cesaro breaking away from Heyman on

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.280 
or Cesaro breaking away from Heyman on
his<00:03:44.910> own<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.330> he's<00:03:45.630> sick<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.990> him<00:03:46.110> talking

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
his own because he's sick of him talking

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.020 
his own because he's sick of him talking
about<00:03:46.530> how<00:03:46.800> Brock<00:03:47.040> conquered<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.700> streak

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
about how Brock conquered the streak

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.510 
about how Brock conquered the streak

that's what happens why not build to a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.480 
that's what happens why not build to a

Big<00:04:46.949> Show<00:04:47.159> match<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.490> wasn't<00:04:47.759> even<00:04:47.819> a<00:04:47.970> match<00:04:48.150> it

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
Big Show match it wasn't even a match it

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.089 
Big Show match it wasn't even a match it
was<00:04:48.449> an<00:04:48.569> angle<00:04:50.150> but<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.870> know<00:04:51.960> why<00:04:52.169> not<00:04:52.349> at

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
was an angle but you know why not at

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.339 
was an angle but you know why not at
least<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.490> allows<00:04:53.729> them<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.240> turn<00:04:54.599> Cesaro<00:04:55.080> back

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
least it allows them to turn Cesaro back

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.230 
least it allows them to turn Cesaro back
into<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.620> babyface<00:04:56.009> let<00:04:56.430> him<00:04:56.580> start<00:04:56.819> swinging

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
needs to stay competitive and he'd

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.040 
needs to stay competitive and he'd
probably<00:05:50.219> get<00:05:50.520> himself<00:05:50.669> even<00:05:51.120> more<00:05:51.479> over<00:05:51.840> just

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
probably get himself even more over just

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.990 
probably get himself even more over just
by<00:05:52.199> you<00:05:52.529> know<00:05:52.560> lifting<00:05:53.069> Brock<00:05:53.310> up<00:05:53.520> for<00:05:53.789> some

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
by you know lifting Brock up for some

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.469 
by you know lifting Brock up for some
impressive<00:05:54.690> power<00:05:54.900> moves<00:05:55.789> so<00:05:56.789> I'm<00:05:57.120> yeah<00:05:57.300> look

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.360 
impressive power moves so I'm yeah look
I<00:05:57.569> guess<00:05:57.719> they<00:05:57.870> could<00:05:58.020> still<00:05:58.229> do<00:05:58.409> it<00:05:58.440> but<00:05:59.130> this

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
I guess they could still do it but this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.399 
I guess they could still do it but this
made<00:05:59.610> this<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.659> know<00:06:00.779> this<00:06:00.960> made<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.259> seem

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
made this you know this made it seem

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:02.899 
made this you know this made it seem
like<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.680> stuff<00:06:01.889> with<00:06:02.039> Heyman<00:06:02.400> was<00:06:02.550> done<00:06:02.789> and

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
like the stuff with Heyman was done and

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.249 
like the stuff with Heyman was done and
over<00:06:03.000> with<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.539> that<00:06:03.779> whole<00:06:03.960> connection

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
over with that that whole connection

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.620 
over with that that whole connection
that<00:06:04.529> whole<00:06:04.680> relationship<00:06:04.919> is<00:06:05.460> finished<00:06:06.330> I

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
that whole relationship is finished I

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.140 
that whole relationship is finished I
don't<00:06:07.590> see<00:06:07.800> how<00:06:07.949> anybody<00:06:08.250> can<00:06:08.639> objectively

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
don't see how anybody can objectively

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.300 
don't see how anybody can objectively
look<00:06:09.479> at<00:06:09.630> this<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:09.990> not<00:06:10.259> consider<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.039> to<00:06:11.159> be<00:06:11.190> a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
look at this and not consider it to be a

look at this and not consider it to be a

Haman's a character on TV doing what

Haman's a character on TV doing what
he's<00:06:18.449> told<00:06:18.630> to<00:06:18.779> do<00:06:19.310> it's<00:06:20.310> a<00:06:20.460> failure<00:06:20.699> on<00:06:21.000> WWE's

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
he's told to do it's a failure on WWE's

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.279 
he's told to do it's a failure on WWE's
part<00:06:21.990> because<00:06:22.529> the<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.460> payoff<00:06:23.819> here<00:06:24.080> was<00:06:25.080> so

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
part because the the payoff here was so

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.010 
part because the the payoff here was so
underwhelming<00:06:26.060> that<00:06:27.060> it<00:06:27.419> almost<00:06:27.569> defies

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
underwhelming that it almost defies

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.409 
underwhelming that it almost defies
logic<00:06:28.469> that<00:06:28.919> this<00:06:29.159> is<00:06:29.310> how<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.490> story<00:06:29.819> it's

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
logic that this is how the story it's

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.029 
logic that this is how the story it's
almost<00:06:30.599> like<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:31.020> can't<00:06:31.319> be<00:06:31.409> how<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.650> ends

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
almost like that can't be how it ends

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.370 
almost like that can't be how it ends
there's<00:06:32.279> got<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.580> be<00:06:32.610> more<00:06:32.819> to<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:33.150> than<00:06:33.270> this

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
there's got to be more to it than this

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.529 
there's got to be more to it than this
but<00:06:34.380> if<00:06:34.979> you<00:06:35.219> listen<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.610> what<00:06:35.789> Cesaro<00:06:35.940> said<00:06:36.419> on

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
but if you listen to what Cesaro said on

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.389 
but if you listen to what Cesaro said on
Monday<00:06:36.779> night<00:06:36.930> apparently<00:06:37.169> that<00:06:37.529> is<00:06:37.649> it<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:38.009> I

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
Monday night apparently that is it and I

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.399 
Monday night apparently that is it and I
I<00:06:38.430> just<00:06:38.729> don't<00:06:39.089> see<00:06:39.690> how<00:06:39.839> you<00:06:39.899> can<00:06:40.110> look<00:06:40.289> at

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
I just don't see how you can look at

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.220 
I just don't see how you can look at
this<00:06:40.529> and<00:06:40.770> not<00:06:40.949> see

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
this and not see

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.460 
this and not see
as<00:06:41.410> a<00:06:41.560> failure<00:06:42.060> so<00:06:43.060> Triple<00:06:43.630> H<00:06:43.750> gave<00:06:43.960> Cesaro<00:06:44.380> a

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
as a failure so Triple H gave Cesaro a

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.050 
as a failure so Triple H gave Cesaro a
chance<00:06:44.800> to<00:06:44.950> impress<00:06:45.220> him<00:06:45.400> by<00:06:45.430> beating<00:06:45.880> Dean

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
chance to impress him by beating Dean
