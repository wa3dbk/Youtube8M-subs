00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.080

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.250

 all this move the fourth latch 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.300

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.830
 latch on the side and the keyboard should 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.380

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 move back and raise in this culture 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 don't just pull 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 raise and lay upside down so as not to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.320
 tear off the train 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.530
