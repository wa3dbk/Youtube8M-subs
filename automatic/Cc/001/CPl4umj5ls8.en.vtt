right after I sold the put option

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.450 
right after I sold the put option
Kellogg<00:01:43.979> started<00:01:44.520> rising<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> stock

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
Kellogg started rising and when a stock

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.050 
Kellogg started rising and when a stock
price<00:01:47.759> rises<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.899> put<00:01:49.229> prices<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
price rises the put prices go down so I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.899 
price rises the put prices go down so I
actually<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> chance<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> buy<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.610> my

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
actually have the chance to buy back my

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
actually have the chance to buy back my
option<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:55.380> May<00:01:56.369> 16th<00:01:57.770> for<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> pretty<00:01:59.250> low

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
option on May 16th for a pretty low

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
option on May 16th for a pretty low
price<00:01:59.759> but<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> decided<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
price but I decided not to because I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700 
price but I decided not to because I
wanted<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> collect<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> little<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
wanted to collect a little more on the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.869 
wanted to collect a little more on the
trade<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:08.009> kind<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> mistake

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
trade but that was kind of a mistake

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.410 
trade but that was kind of a mistake
because

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
because

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
because
after<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:11.050> date<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.520> stock<00:02:12.959> took<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.020> dive

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
after that date the stock took a dive

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.510 
after that date the stock took a dive
and<00:02:14.920> went<00:02:15.280> below<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:16.060> 50-day<00:02:16.720> moving<00:02:16.750> average

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and went below my 50-day moving average

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.720 
and went below my 50-day moving average
and<00:02:18.520> luckily<00:02:19.300> for<00:02:19.420> me<00:02:21.150> after<00:02:22.150> June<00:02:22.390> 3rd<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.920> was

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.449 
and luckily for me after June 3rd it was
able<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> recover<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:27.160> up<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.020> today<00:02:29.459> June
