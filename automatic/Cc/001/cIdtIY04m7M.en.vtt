00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.840
 and good hello to all of you 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.670
 activists 31 I hope you go 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.550
 well today we're back in 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.529
 division 1 on fifa 15 ultimate team 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.779
 so we will continue this little 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.099
 division 1 that we started well for the 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.710
 moment since we are two victories 0 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.390
 zero zero defeat we had won so 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.800
 this is the first game 5 goals to 1 on 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.849
 second 3 goals to 2 where I believe that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 it was in the opposite direction 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.530
 yeah nan it's in the opposite way he 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.750
 seems to me wait good I know more but 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.550
 well we do not care anyway go 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.440
 it's gone to play match I show you 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.540
 the team 82 I did a little 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.850
 always turn a boat the eye well 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.160
 sure small rotation of the players so there 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.950
 we come to robin van persie we put some 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 lo誰c remy in front and oscar and william 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.210
 wiljan's this is the first time I 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.860
 you propose it to me it seems and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 frankly I'm tired of falling 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.489
 against him every time because he's 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.600
 super agile it is super strong already that 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.399
 last year it was a monster 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.770
 and this year it's a little bit 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.600
 even even limit in worse so I had 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.720
 want to try it and I hope it goes 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 will bring that positive of course to go 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.649
 looking for opponents hoping that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.630
 it finds quickly as usual 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.950
 let's see everything will depend on my 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.780
 internet connection because she is a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.240
 little catastrophic to two it goes three 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.159
 bars today plus this one ok it 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.929
 took the yellow jersey 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.639
 he has the chelsea emblem so he goes 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.799
 to make a boat the eye certainly yes 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.149
 necessarily ah well yes and well he did 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.659
 that makes it the guy he snored 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.609
 chelsea so that that does not make me 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.749
 I am I am a bit puzzled by 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.670
 report to that I do not understand the 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.100
 people who remake a club 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.990
 completely on ultimate team I have a 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.399
 little bit of trouble understanding these people 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.219
 there then after I can compare 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.689
 understand the love of the club and of course 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.209
 stats a little bit modified other 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.740
 but ultimate team is made to do 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.359
 pleasure what to do his dream team 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.380
 after each his dream team of course 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.289
 here we go 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.789
 in this third division game she 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.950
 that would be stupid 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.139
 ohlala wait do not wait what me 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.649
 put the misery there ok it's good it's good 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.979
 clear everything is fine ok it's not too much 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.500
 wrong 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.200
 go the food and the poor could t 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.110
 she no teeth to the whore I saw her 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.190
 in there ok the strike 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.800
 what a strike 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.280
 which cannon ball passes it in 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 depth for lo誰c remy the striking 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.980
 is that they are goal I have not seen who 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.820
 know there is yes behind this is cd &amp; v 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.530
 aquila is not a bad goal she has 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.350
 gone deep we are not 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.360
 bad to swing the tackle the goal the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.340
 shooting by tackling to have not even he has 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 managed to stay upright because he managed to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.050
 to stand up everything is fine and here we are 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.730
 is finally rewarded a little pass in 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.320
 depth of robin van persie the cost 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.810
 oscar poles and then here is the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.040
 shooting by tackling for the goal while 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.780
 just before he had just made me a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.820
 completely failed 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.260
 played well to him and he puts the team in 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.660
 common sense a boom last ball is for 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.700
 Marouane fellaini goes deep 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.000
 dawn and she is not bad for lo誰c 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.240
 remy 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.710
 she is not bad and it's a goal lo誰c 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.920
 remy for the 2 goals to 0 in the 38th minute 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.780
 the little lb y of marouane 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.850
 fellaini and yes because it's rare 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 already if you if you analyze well the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.800
 goals that I put in my videos on 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.709
 fifa 15 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.810
 it's definitely i'll say 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.880
 maybe the second lp y only that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.340
 I put in twelve videos anyway 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200
 do not tell me I put goals 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.209
 easy like that was a nickname I you 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.310
 see the little rascals coming in 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.640
 any case of zero we are not bad before the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.820
 half time 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.760
 1 is the half time 2 goals to 0 for the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.250
 nil or fc and yes guys see see 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.190
 the six shots 4 shots including two 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.459
 goals 51% possession and for me 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.410
 opponents 000 frames and because 9 % of 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.510
 possession is what can be said that I 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.340
 totally dominates it clearly there 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.560
 can say that I dominate we will not go we will 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.630
 not messing up so after should not 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.340
 take too much confidence either 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.040
 will have to be careful 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.209
 the match is not over so we're going 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.040
 try to go and plant a third 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.900
 even a fourth is there from this 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220
 moment we will try to have fun and 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.600
 do freestyle so wait for their 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.510
 expectations and to us also the purpose of 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.890
 commitment and bane persie the strike 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.770
 is not that far anyway 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.350
 it was not that far then that one 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.700
 cram and lp can cram and but 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.820
 what can we really do 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.210
 hugo lloris him to can do it she 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.400
 abuse the bug 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.020
 he could do something about it 'go lloris 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.790
 with his magnificent arm attention he 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 is all alone screw of the head that goes 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.320
 it sets back to be able to sue 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.930
 the big hits the big shot 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.440
 no, we did not even want that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:56.490
 crocheted he is alone at the level 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:59.290
 lloris you save me life ou attention 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.390
 to play well to him and he puts me the goal 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.140
 well played to him completely there he has 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.660
 does a masterful rush with on the and 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.260
 as I said be careful about the excess of 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.140
 trust 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.060
 watch two nozzles at her at the pass 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.410
 I thought lloris was much more 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.990
 close to him that's why I left 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.050
 the goal will have been an error of my 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.460
 part to go attention now he's going 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.960
 make it back and forth here 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.450
 on the spot round trips for 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.310
 scratch a few inches it's 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.840
 past is past but stopped there 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.810
 stop it but what are you 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.550
 do or not we are cracking 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.140
 what is this disgusting goal that took me 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.790
 put so much he did not let the 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.270
 idle he knows it's shit there 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.940
 without any goal 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.110
 anything that I have no 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:51.010
 defender who was going on say 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.940
 to costa diego costa diego costa i there 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.670
 not think I do not believe I do ah 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.130
 I do not believe it there 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.940
 aie aie aie aie 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.640
 Oh, how's it going to whistle the 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:10.060
 end of the match and it's over I bow 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.890
 3 goals to 2 in a second half time 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.710
 totally catastrophic what 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:21.550
 absurdity on my part to have believed that 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.590
 I was going to win the match with such 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.590
 ease in first half I had 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.110
 tripled of diego costa but then ima 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.200
 rotten the match diego costa clearly 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.450
 it hurt me 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.640
 and unfortunately total relaxation in 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.130
 second half time and here I lose I 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.440
 lose this match 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.210
 Ouch Ouch I am I am honestly 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.090
 I 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.190
 tell I'm completely disgusted but 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.169
 it does not matter it's just a match 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.599
 what you have to say is that it can 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.280
 to arrive now that serves as a lesson 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.410
 also since now I'm going to know 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.030
 that when I win 2 0 I do not have to 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.009
 have fun behind I really have to 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.229
 tried to give my maximum to stay 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.660
 concentrated and there look he did three 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.139
 shots shot for two shots three shots 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.830
 three goals anyway it's still 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.099
 pretty impressive 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.470
 and next time I would give to 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.000
 sailing to 100% of my abilities but 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.530
 really all the way through the match 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.840
 in any case I hope you have 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.610
