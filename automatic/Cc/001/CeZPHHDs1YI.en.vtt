00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.340 
now all I'm gonna do is just frame the
rest<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.810> face

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
rest of the face

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.410 
rest of the face
starting<00:04:06.950> at<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.070> corner<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.820> eyes<00:04:07.970> and

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
starting at the corner of the eyes and

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.530 
starting at the corner of the eyes and
since<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.170> eye<00:04:09.200> comes<00:04:09.800> up<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:11.120> turn<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.360> little

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
since the eye comes up you turn a little

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.060 
since the eye comes up you turn a little
bit<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:11.900> way<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.110> comes<00:04:12.380> up<00:04:12.560> I'm<00:04:12.890> gonna

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
bit this way it comes up I'm gonna

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.580 
bit this way it comes up I'm gonna
follow<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.760> pattern<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.450> I'm<00:04:14.900> going<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.350> just

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
follow that pattern so I'm going to just

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.390 
follow that pattern so I'm going to just
swirl<00:04:16.430> into<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.060> eye<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:18.130> create<00:04:19.130> my

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
swirl into the eye and create my

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.440 
swirl into the eye and create my
teardrops<00:04:19.700> heading<00:04:20.510> into<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.020> eye<00:04:21.050> that<00:04:21.440> way

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.690 

and<00:04:26.450> then<00:04:27.200> from<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.710> bottom<00:04:27.920> I'm<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.640> to

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
and then from the bottom I'm going to

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.210 
and then from the bottom I'm going to
come<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.180> again<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.900> then<00:04:30.230> I'm<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.410> going<00:04:30.920> to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.390 
come in again and then I'm just going to
swirl<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.790> in<00:04:32.090> right<00:04:32.780> there<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.410> from<00:04:34.340> that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
swirl it in right there and from that

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.170 
swirl it in right there and from that
swirl<00:04:35.170> I'm<00:04:36.170> gonna<00:04:36.350> come<00:04:36.680> off<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.760> build

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
swirl I'm gonna come off of it and build

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.920

a bigger one right in the middle so I

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.500 
a bigger one right in the middle so I
can<00:05:44.410> connect<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:45.010> now<00:05:45.370> I'm<00:05:46.030> gonna<00:05:46.210> go<00:05:46.450> ahead

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510
