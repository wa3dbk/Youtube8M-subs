 [Music] 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 for those who do not have time some want 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.849
 to make good diet tips from 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.579
 now on the 9th flowers tv to facilitate the 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.189
 your life today how to sanitize 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.650
 vegetables so they last longer in your 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.160
 then we have some 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.339
 vegetable arugula and American lettuce 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.879
 these vegetables have been previously 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:46.890
 sanitized by a minimum of 30 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 minutes in 3% personal oxygenated water 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.619
 that I order to do in handling can 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.229
 chlorine solution should also be used 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.239
 but I do not like chlorine 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.780
 so I prefer hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 the idea is to make you understand the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.360
 process of these vegetables 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.020
 in the fridge so what I need to have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 is the right machinery for this to exist 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 the famous always leak vegetable 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.830
 we took the already cleaned vegetables and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.150
 wet and put them to dry them with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.470
 centrifuge can be blended or not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.900
 whatever 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.790
 Let's get some sample of each 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.659
 one to do at once in the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.150
 centrifugal 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.460
 the ideal is not to fill too much so that it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.000
 have space then we give the crank to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.580
 this rod and dry vegetables and so 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 disperses liquid from the vegetables and 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 we have practically had regions 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.680
 dry just squeeze prepare the next 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 step then get paper towel and go 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.590
 placing these vegetables 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.860
 we put a vegetable we put more 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 layers of paper towel and so on. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.879
 successively 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 I am showing with your curves that 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.220
 are great for you to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.349
 see well when they go to the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.150
 refrigerator that paper towel will absorb 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.560
 continuously olic of the rest that the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.790
 centrifugal did not yield 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 turkey sun then we put them in bags 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.670
 we can then fold them or put them in 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.849
 larger bags also serve 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.550
 and to finish at the time of saving in 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.569
 refrigerator we put out by placing a hand 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.769
 here and dispersing the maximum amount of air 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:54.750
 we have in those bags and we give 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.989
 a knot and keep them that way. 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.260
 vegetables staff will last from seven to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.470
 ten days in your refrigerator clean and ready 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.810
 to be used only to assemble salad only 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 to make green juice at the time yet 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.640
 sanitized and lasting in your refrigerator 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.330
 until the next year
