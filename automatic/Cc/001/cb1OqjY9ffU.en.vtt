00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
using it that's pretty cool as well and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.039 
using it that's pretty cool as well and
then<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> Mike<00:03:04.400> itself<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.359> I'm<00:03:05.420> no<00:03:05.570> plastics

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
then the Mike itself so I'm no plastics

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.680 
then the Mike itself so I'm no plastics
here<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.410> is<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.820> an<00:03:07.820> aluminium<00:03:08.390> chassis

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.220 
they're laser and you've got on here an
on/off<00:03:23.180> switch<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.660> you're<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:23.810> draining<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
on/off switch so you're not draining the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.569 
on/off switch so you're not draining the
battery<00:03:24.530> power<00:03:24.739> when<00:03:25.040> you're<00:03:25.160> not<00:03:25.250> using<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
battery power when you're not using the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.880 
battery power when you're not using the
Mike<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.690> 10<00:03:26.959> DB<00:03:27.079> pad<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.620> that's<00:03:27.739> really

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
Mike and a 10 DB pad and that's really

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.009 
Mike and a 10 DB pad and that's really
important<00:03:28.370> because<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.390> capsule<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.810> more

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
important because the capsule is more

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.330 
important because the capsule is more
sensitive<00:03:30.350> we<00:03:30.560> designed<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.010> way<00:03:31.160> so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
sensitive we designed it that way so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.130 
sensitive we designed it that way so
you've<00:03:31.549> got<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> really<00:03:31.970> good<00:03:32.180> hot<00:03:32.420> signal<00:03:32.660> into

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
you've got a really good hot signal into

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.599 
you've got a really good hot signal into
the<00:03:33.230> camera<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.040> lowers<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
the camera and that lowers the

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.000 
the camera and that lowers the
signal-to-noise<00:03:34.940> ratio<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.739> if<00:03:36.859> it's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
signal-to-noise ratio and then if it's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.770 
signal-to-noise ratio and then if it's
too<00:03:37.190> hot<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.400> certain<00:03:37.819> cameras<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.600> there's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
too hot for certain cameras then there's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.940 
too hot for certain cameras then there's
a<00:03:38.810> cut<00:03:39.019> on<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.799> reduce

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
a cut on there so you can just reduce

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.250 
a cut on there so you can just reduce
the<00:03:40.250> level<00:03:40.519> other<00:03:41.060> manufacturers<00:03:41.810> do<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
the level other manufacturers do the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.689 
the level other manufacturers do the
opposite<00:03:42.590> they've<00:03:42.769> got<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.919> boost<00:03:43.220> switch<00:03:43.400> on

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
opposite they've got a boost switch on

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.310 
opposite they've got a boost switch on
this<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.000> they<00:03:44.150> go<00:03:44.299> for<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> non

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
this so they go for a non

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.300 
this so they go for a non
battery-powered

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
battery-powered

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.020 
battery-powered
less<00:03:47.760> sensitive<00:03:48.239> capsules<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:50.700> problem<00:03:50.940> with

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
less sensitive capsules the problem with

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.190 
less sensitive capsules the problem with
that<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.300> that<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.599> have<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> boost<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
that is that if you have to boost the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.809 
that is that if you have to boost the
signal<00:03:52.230> into<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.709> camera<00:03:53.069> then<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.640> course

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
signal into the camera then of course

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.830 
signal into the camera then of course
you're<00:03:54.000> increasing<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.480> signal-to-noise

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you're increasing the signal-to-noise

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.630 
you're increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:55.560> well<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.040> get<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.220> noisier

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
ratio as well so you get a noisier

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.070 
ratio as well so you get a noisier
recording<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.360> camera<00:03:57.660> requires<00:03:57.989> a

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
recording if the camera requires a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.860 
recording if the camera requires a
hotter<00:03:58.319> signal<00:03:59.209> this<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.420> treat

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
hotter signal this is a treat

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.930 
hotter signal this is a treat
broadcast-quality<00:04:01.380> shotgun<00:04:02.040> microphone<00:04:02.489> and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
broadcast-quality shotgun microphone and

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.830 
broadcast-quality shotgun microphone and
it's<00:04:03.270> in<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> retail<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> about<00:04:04.560> 99<00:04:05.370> pounds<00:04:05.840> 120

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
it's in a retail of about 99 pounds 120

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.470 
it's in a retail of about 99 pounds 120
euros<00:04:07.220> something<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.760> very<00:04:09.330> good

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
euros something like that so very good

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.809 
euros something like that so very good
value<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:09.780> money<00:04:09.900> very<00:04:10.650> cool<00:04:10.950> looking<00:04:11.250> really

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
value for money very cool looking really

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.239 
value for money very cool looking really
