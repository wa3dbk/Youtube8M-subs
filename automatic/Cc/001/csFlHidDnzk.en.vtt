Sangiovese the best expression of that I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.660 
Sangiovese the best expression of that I
think<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.540> 2011<00:03:33.860> vintage<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.250> little<00:03:35.549> bit

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670

younger very good quality and about
twenty<00:03:38.880> dollars<00:03:39.000> costs<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.370> believe<00:03:41.510> that's

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
twenty dollars costs I believe that's

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:52.280

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
no that's I was actually American oak

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.860 
no that's I was actually American oak
who<00:04:39.890> was<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.130> strong<00:04:40.460> hmm<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.270> was<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:41.630> to

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
who was so strong hmm so I was going to

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.990 
who was so strong hmm so I was going to
Spain<00:04:42.140> and<00:04:42.320> Rioja<00:04:42.740> law<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.370> doesn't<00:04:43.730> quite

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
Spain and Rioja law and it doesn't quite

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.600 
Spain and Rioja law and it doesn't quite
behave<00:04:44.450> like<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:45.040> Tempranillo<00:04:46.040> on<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.310> palate

behave like a Tempranillo on the palate
I<00:04:46.700> think<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.030> isn't<00:04:47.180> Italian<00:04:47.660> wine<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:49.580> you're

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
I think it isn't Italian wine and you're

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.170 
I think it isn't Italian wine and you're
probably<00:04:50.480> right<00:04:50.990> on<00:04:51.910> Sangiovese<00:04:52.910> from

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
probably right on Sangiovese from

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.570 
probably right on Sangiovese from
Tuscany<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:54.230> a<00:04:54.350> fairly<00:04:54.740> modern<00:04:55.130> style<00:04:55.460> I

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
Tuscany but it's a fairly modern style I

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.740 
Tuscany but it's a fairly modern style I
think<00:04:55.730> there's<00:04:55.880> maybe<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.330> little<00:04:56.390> bit<00:04:56.660> of

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
think there's maybe a little bit of

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.250 
think there's maybe a little bit of
Merlot<00:04:57.080> or<00:04:57.110> Cabernet<00:04:57.320> blended<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.190> here<00:04:58.460> and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
Merlot or Cabernet blended in here and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.330 
Merlot or Cabernet blended in here and
it's<00:05:00.260> because<00:05:00.410> nice<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.740> smooth<00:05:01.010> I<00:05:01.070> like<00:05:01.220> the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
it's because nice and smooth I like the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.850 
it's because nice and smooth I like the
extra<00:05:01.760> but<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:02.450> got<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.630> good<00:05:03.200> sort<00:05:03.800> of

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
extra but it's got that good sort of

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.450 
extra but it's got that good sort of
acidity<00:05:04.340> from<00:05:04.610> Italian<00:05:04.940> Italian<00:05:05.870> Reds<00:05:06.460> the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
acidity from Italian Italian Reds the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.800 
acidity from Italian Italian Reds the
only<00:05:07.610> place<00:05:07.730> will<00:05:07.850> disagree<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.300> think<00:05:08.570> this<00:05:08.660> is

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
only place will disagree I think this is
