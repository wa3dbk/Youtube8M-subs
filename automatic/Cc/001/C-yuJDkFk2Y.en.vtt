00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you know that some sort of record

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.660 
you know that some sort of record

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
because I mean that's a lot you know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
because I mean that's a lot you know
obviously<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> hundred<00:01:45.990> percent<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.350> them

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
obviously not a hundred percent of them

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.920 
obviously not a hundred percent of them
are<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.310> completely<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.450> perfect

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
are all you know completely in perfect

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.929 
are all you know completely in perfect
condition<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.649> even<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.520> completely

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
condition or even just completely

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.660 
condition or even just completely
functional<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.810> sometimes<00:01:52.579> some<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
functional you know sometimes some of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100 
functional you know sometimes some of
the<00:01:53.729> controllers<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the controllers that I have you know a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
the controllers that I have you know a
certain<00:01:56.040> button<00:01:56.460> doesn't<00:01:56.640> work<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> has<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
certain button doesn't work or it has a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.679 
certain button doesn't work or it has a
very<00:01:57.689> loose<00:01:58.070> thumb<00:01:59.070> stick<00:01:59.399> but<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
very loose thumb stick but you know it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
very loose thumb stick but you know it
is<00:02:00.930> an<00:02:01.259> n64<00:02:01.979> controller<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is an n64 controller you know what is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
is an n64 controller you know what is
the<00:02:03.329> actual<00:02:03.689> thing<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.320> fake<00:02:04.590> or

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the actual thing it's not like fake or

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
the actual thing it's not like fake or
anything<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> does<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.570> pretty<00:02:07.049> much

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
anything so it does I do pretty much

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.499 
anything so it does I do pretty much
count<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.770> as

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
count it as

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.050 
count it as
or<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.319> do<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:10.159> a<00:02:10.190> lot<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.399> third-party

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
or I do have a lot of third-party

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.410 
or I do have a lot of third-party
controllers<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:11.659> well<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.610> don't<00:02:14.150> know<00:02:14.299> if

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
controllers as well so I don't know if

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.839 
controllers as well so I don't know if
you<00:02:14.480> want<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.720> factor<00:02:15.019> that<00:02:15.140> into<00:02:15.349> the

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
you want to factor that into the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.979 
you want to factor that into the
controller<00:02:16.849> count<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.599> know<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.750> still

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
controller count but you know I still

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.140 
controller count but you know I still
count<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> Nintendo<00:02:19.459> 64<00:02:20.000> controller

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
count it as a Nintendo 64 controller

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.600 
count it as a Nintendo 64 controller
right<00:02:21.019> now<00:02:21.170> how<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> mounted<00:02:22.099> them<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> wall

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
right now how I mounted them on the wall

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
right now how I mounted them on the wall
so<00:02:23.120> basically<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.750> did<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.930> got<00:02:24.170> pretty

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
so basically what I did I got pretty

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.320 
so basically what I did I got pretty
creative<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.830> know<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.980> had<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> lot<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.970> ideas

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
creative you know I had a lot of ideas

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.710 
creative you know I had a lot of ideas
that<00:02:26.420> failed<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.129> know<00:02:28.250> if<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.819> if<00:02:29.120> you

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that failed so you know if you if you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.199 
that failed so you know if you if you
want<00:02:29.959> an<00:02:30.110> idea<00:02:30.410> or<00:02:30.500> whatever<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
want an idea or whatever this is this is

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.240 
want an idea or whatever this is this is
a<00:02:32.239> pretty<00:02:32.450> much<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.840> temporary<00:02:33.260> hold<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.980> would

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
a pretty much a temporary hold I would

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.490 
a pretty much a temporary hold I would
say<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.450> back<00:02:35.629> of<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> controller<00:02:36.230> where<00:02:36.410> you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
say the back of the controller where you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.530 
say the back of the controller where you
put<00:02:36.709> controller<00:02:37.040> packs<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:37.700> rumble<00:02:37.940> packs<00:02:38.269> I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
put controller packs or rumble packs I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.319 
put controller packs or rumble packs I
basically<00:02:39.290> stuck<00:02:39.560> styrofoam<00:02:40.129> in<00:02:40.280> there<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.670> I

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
basically stuck styrofoam in there and I

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.729 
basically stuck styrofoam in there and I
you<00:02:41.390> know<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.629> made<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> little<00:02:42.170> hole<00:02:42.349> at<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.590> end

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
you know I made a little hole at the end

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.830 
you know I made a little hole at the end
of<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.890> styrofoam<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.329> I<00:02:44.569> pretty<00:02:44.750> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
of the styrofoam and I pretty much

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.390 
of the styrofoam and I pretty much
mounted<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.620> way<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.829> know<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> put<00:02:46.250> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
mounted it that way you know I put a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640 
mounted it that way you know I put a
simple<00:02:46.640> thumbtack<00:02:47.209> there<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.319> you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
simple thumbtack there and I just you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
simple thumbtack there and I just you
know<00:02:48.680> fit<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.099> controller<00:02:49.459> sometimes<00:02:50.299> it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
know fit the controller sometimes it

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.940 
know fit the controller sometimes it
works<00:02:50.660> sometimes<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.200> doesn't<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.769> have

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
works sometimes it doesn't you just have

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.420 
works sometimes it doesn't you just have
to<00:02:52.069> get<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.829> very

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
to get it right so that's like a very

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.940 
to get it right so that's like a very
simple<00:02:55.790> temporary<00:02:56.720> hold<00:02:57.079> if<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.560> want<00:02:57.799> to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
simple temporary hold if you want to

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.880 
simple temporary hold if you want to
mount<00:02:58.129> your<00:02:58.250> controllers<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:58.879> your<00:02:59.030> wall<00:02:59.209> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
mount your controllers on your wall and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.490 
mount your controllers on your wall and
basically<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.670> know<00:03:01.930> not<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.260> cord

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
basically to you know not have the cord

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.380 
basically to you know not have the cord
show<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:04.370> know<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.519> just<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> Ravel<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.299> up

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
show you know you just you Ravel it up

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.880 
show you know you just you Ravel it up
you<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:07.430> know<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.730> generic<00:03:08.890> cord

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
you do the you know the generic cord

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.729 
you do the you know the generic cord
wrap<00:03:10.519> up<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.849> guess<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.359> know<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:12.530> you

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
wrap up I guess you know and not you

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.199 
wrap up I guess you know and not you
know<00:03:12.799> just<00:03:12.889> tie<00:03:13.160> rubber<00:03:13.430> band<00:03:13.609> around<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:14.060> and

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
know just tie rubber band around it and

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.559 
know just tie rubber band around it and
then<00:03:14.359> just<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.019> know<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.359> pretty

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
then just you know it just it pretty

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.839 
then just you know it just it pretty
much<00:03:17.690> holds<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:18.739> that's<00:03:19.340> that's<00:03:19.639> why<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
much holds so that's that's why you

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.190 
much holds so that's that's why you
can't<00:03:20.209> see<00:03:20.359> any<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.690> cords<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.109> know

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
can't see any of the cords you know

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.479 
can't see any of the cords you know
they're<00:03:21.349> not<00:03:21.440> cut<00:03:21.709> off<00:03:21.829> or<00:03:22.040> anything<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.459> are

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
they're not cut off or anything they are

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.140 
they're not cut off or anything they are
behind<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> controller<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.669> that's<00:03:25.669> you<00:03:26.030> know

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
behind the controller so that's you know

really amazing condition and they're

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.550 
really amazing condition and they're
just<00:03:44.060> one<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.269> every<00:03:44.630> controller<00:03:45.049> pretty<00:03:45.349> much

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
just one of every controller pretty much

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.879 
just one of every controller pretty much
those<00:03:46.459> are<00:03:46.639> all<00:03:46.760> held<00:03:47.060> up<00:03:47.209> by<00:03:47.359> two<00:03:47.709> screws<00:03:48.709> that

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
those are all held up by two screws that

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.770 
those are all held up by two screws that
I<00:03:48.950> put<00:03:49.130> in<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.280> wall<00:03:49.419> once<00:03:50.419> I'm<00:03:50.569> satisfied

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
I put in the wall once I'm satisfied

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.470 
I put in the wall once I'm satisfied
with<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.790> formation<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:52.940> my<00:03:53.060> wall<00:03:53.239> with<00:03:53.389> the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
with the formation on my wall with the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.240 
with the formation on my wall with the
other<00:03:53.629> controllers<00:03:54.169> soon<00:03:54.440> I'll<00:03:54.620> probably<00:03:54.889> be

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
other controllers soon I'll probably be

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.190 
other controllers soon I'll probably be
doing<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.639> same<00:03:55.819> thing<00:03:55.879> just<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.989> make<00:03:57.169> it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
doing the same thing just to make it

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.909 
doing the same thing just to make it
more<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.799> you<00:03:58.700> know<00:03:58.849> a<00:03:59.359> better<00:04:00.079> hold<00:04:00.440> on<00:04:00.799> the

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
more of a you know a better hold on the

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.099 
more of a you know a better hold on the
wall<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.180> know<00:04:02.209> worrying<00:04:02.660> about<00:04:02.780> if

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
wall and not you know worrying about if

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.050 
wall and not you know worrying about if
the<00:04:03.230> styrofoam<00:04:03.739> will<00:04:03.919> hold<00:04:04.129> up<00:04:04.280> or<00:04:04.430> not<00:04:04.549> after

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the styrofoam will hold up or not after

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.479 
the styrofoam will hold up or not after
a<00:04:05.090> while<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.690> soon<00:04:06.410> I'll<00:04:06.650> have<00:04:06.680> them<00:04:07.069> all<00:04:07.310> on<00:04:07.340> my

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
a while so soon I'll have them all on my

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.420 
a while so soon I'll have them all on my
wall<00:04:07.819> all<00:04:08.150> nicely<00:04:08.739> secured<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.949> everything

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
wall all nicely secured and everything

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.280 
wall all nicely secured and everything
so<00:04:10.760> that's<00:04:11.299> how<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.569> hold<00:04:11.870> up<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.260> other

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so that's how I hold up the other

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.289 
so that's how I hold up the other
controllers<00:04:12.889> that's<00:04:13.040> probably<00:04:13.459> why<00:04:13.669> they

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
controllers that's probably why they

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.080 
controllers that's probably why they
look<00:04:14.449> a<00:04:14.569> little<00:04:14.720> bit<00:04:14.930> nicer<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.590> wall

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
look a little bit nicer on the wall

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.090 
look a little bit nicer on the wall
