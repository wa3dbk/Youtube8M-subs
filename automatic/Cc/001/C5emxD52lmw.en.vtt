we<00:00:50.570> do<00:00:50.690> it<00:00:50.810> in<00:00:50.870> exactly<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.470> same<00:00:51.500> way<00:00:52.160> beside

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
we do it in exactly the same way beside

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.340 
we do it in exactly the same way beside
one<00:00:53.470> side<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:55.120> side<00:00:56.120> three<00:00:56.420> just<00:00:56.810> like<00:00:56.990> we<00:00:57.170> did

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
one side to side three just like we did

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.800 
one side to side three just like we did
laughs<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.850> want<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.120> go<00:00:59.240> a<00:00:59.270> little<00:00:59.450> quicker

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
laughs just want to go a little quicker

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.330 
laughs just want to go a little quicker

again<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.580> grinding<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.120> way<00:01:12.390> faster<00:01:12.960> than

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
again I'm grinding this way faster than

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.540 
again I'm grinding this way faster than
you<00:01:13.260> would<00:01:14.090> don't<00:01:15.090> forget<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:19.400> we're<00:01:20.400> gonna

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
you would don't forget that we're gonna

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:32.360 
you would don't forget that we're gonna
zoom<00:01:20.880> through<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.800> hear<00:01:31.980> it<00:01:32.130> boiling

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
zoom through it you can hear it boiling

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:49.220 
zoom through it you can hear it boiling
it<00:01:45.200> okay<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.470> night<00:01:46.710> 1<00:01:47.390> side<00:01:48.390> 2<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.960> going

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
it okay that's night 1 side 2 is going

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:56.300 
it okay that's night 1 side 2 is going
to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.190> side<00:01:50.520> rate

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.040 

which<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.490> exactly<00:01:57.970> like<00:01:58.210> grinding<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> top

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
which is exactly like grinding the top

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
which is exactly like grinding the top
rake<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> right-hander<00:02:01.830> but<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:02.920> do<00:02:03.070> this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.450 

I'm<00:02:12.670> actually<00:02:12.910> resting<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.870> tool<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
I'm actually resting this tool on the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.630 
I'm actually resting this tool on the
tool<00:02:15.670> rest<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.150> then<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.540> tipping<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.050> out

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
tool rest and then just tipping it out

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.590 
tool rest and then just tipping it out
and<00:02:18.640> many<00:02:19.240> people<00:02:19.600> find<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.020> easier<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:21.600> don't

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
and many people find that easier I don't

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.040 
and many people find that easier I don't
do<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.140> unless<00:02:23.350> I'm<00:02:23.680> trying<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.130> really

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
do that unless I'm trying to really

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.180 
do that unless I'm trying to really
hurry<00:02:26.050> myself<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.360> may<00:02:28.540> find<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.990> easier

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
hurry myself but you may find it easier

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.790 
hurry myself but you may find it easier
some<00:02:30.190> people<00:02:30.520> do

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.350 

all<00:02:35.800> right<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.750> site<00:02:38.080> two<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.060> it's

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
all right that's site two and it's

smoking<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.870> little<00:02:40.959> bit<00:02:41.200> still<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
smoking a little bit still that's the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.530 
smoking a little bit still that's the
side<00:02:43.420> rate<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.880> we're<00:02:46.090> gonna<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
side rate now we're gonna go on the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.620 
side rate now we're gonna go on the
other<00:02:46.720> side<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.200> wheel<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:48.099> cut<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:49.450> top

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
other side of the wheel and cut the top

00:02:49.630 --> 00:03:00.839 
other side of the wheel and cut the top
break<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.170> exactly<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.769> same<00:02:50.800> manner<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:59.849> can

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
break in exactly the same manner you can

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.300 
break in exactly the same manner you can
just<00:03:01.540> slide<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.050> into<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.380> wheel<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.069> then

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
just slide it into the wheel and then

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.700 
just slide it into the wheel and then
rotate<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.819> cutter<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.500> rate

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.400 

not<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.860> way<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> normally<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:11.410> okay

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
not the way I normally do it but okay

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.160 
not the way I normally do it but okay
here's<00:03:13.340> how<00:03:13.460> I<00:03:13.520> normally<00:03:13.760> hold<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.420> cutter

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.840 

seems<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.320> work<00:03:18.470> well<00:03:18.830> for<00:03:18.860> me<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.520> can<00:03:19.730> do

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
seems to work well for me you can do

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.880 
seems to work well for me you can do
whatever<00:03:20.060> works

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.289 

grinding<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.069> bass<00:03:28.310> makes<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> tool<00:03:29.030> very

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
grinding that bass makes the tool very

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:39.059 
grinding that bass makes the tool very
hot

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.770 

and<00:03:39.879> when<00:03:40.420> we<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.719> close<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:43.000> static<00:03:43.540> line

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and when we get close the static line

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.970 
and when we get close the static line
until<00:03:44.349> it's<00:03:44.590> being<00:03:46.109> cut<00:03:47.109> off<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.439> top<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.859> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
until it's being cut off the top of the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.080 
until it's being cut off the top of the
pool

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
pool

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.720 
pool
that<00:03:50.090> means<00:03:50.300> we're<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:51.459> now<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.489> would

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that means we're there now I would

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.400 
that means we're there now I would
continue<00:03:53.209> grinding<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> little<00:03:54.050> bit<00:03:54.260> it's

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
continue grinding this a little bit it's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.470

not<00:03:54.590> exactly<00:03:55.040> sharp<00:03:55.370> yet<00:03:55.580> but<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.879> get<00:03:56.300> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
not exactly sharp yet but you get the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.610 
not exactly sharp yet but you get the
idea<00:03:57.550> what<00:03:58.550> she<00:03:58.730> looks<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:59.230> that's<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.410> left

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
hand tool and I'm gonna throw a radius

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.880 
hand tool and I'm gonna throw a radius
on<00:04:04.129> there<00:04:04.340> real<00:04:04.519> quick<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:08.410> as<00:04:09.410> we<00:04:09.560> did<00:04:09.680> with

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
on there real quick just as we did with

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.979 
on there real quick just as we did with
the<00:04:09.980> right<00:04:10.130> hand<00:04:10.340> tool<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:17.209> there<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.959> have

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.560 
the right hand tool and there you have
it<00:04:18.380> if<00:04:18.919> this<00:04:19.100> were<00:04:19.280> high<00:04:19.430> speed<00:04:19.760> steel<00:04:20.150> and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
it if this were high speed steel and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.360 
it if this were high speed steel and
we'd<00:04:21.049> continue<00:04:21.500> grinding<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:22.040> little<00:04:22.220> bit

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
we'd continue grinding a little bit

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.710 
we'd continue grinding a little bit
until<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.940> cutting<00:04:23.479> edge<00:04:23.630> was<00:04:23.900> truly<00:04:24.340> sharp

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
until the cutting edge was truly sharp

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.200 
until the cutting edge was truly sharp
we<00:04:26.720> would<00:04:27.310> have<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.370> wonderful<00:04:28.729> tool<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.060> cut
