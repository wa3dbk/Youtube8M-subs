00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
let's go with it and it was more fun and

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.379 
let's go with it and it was more fun and
more<00:04:41.979> rewarding<00:04:42.639> than<00:04:42.729> anything<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.060> ever<00:04:43.090> did

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
more rewarding than anything I ever did

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.689 
more rewarding than anything I ever did
because<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:43.840> was<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.800> was<00:04:44.979> if<00:04:45.220> there<00:04:45.430> was<00:04:45.520> ever

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
because it was it was if there was ever

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.670 
because it was it was if there was ever
a<00:04:45.790> weakness<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.600> my<00:04:46.720> storytelling<00:04:47.110> even<00:04:47.560> at

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
a weakness in my storytelling even at

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.650 
a weakness in my storytelling even at
that<00:04:47.770> point<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.610> was<00:04:48.729> flushed<00:04:49.060> out<00:04:49.240> working<00:04:49.570> on

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
that point it was flushed out working on

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.969 
that point it was flushed out working on
this<00:04:49.840> because<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.380> couldn't<00:04:50.650> do<00:04:50.770> anything

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
this because you couldn't do anything

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.430 
this because you couldn't do anything
but<00:04:51.160> storytelling<00:04:51.729> this<00:04:52.139> first<00:04:53.139> thing<00:04:53.320> as

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
but storytelling this first thing as
