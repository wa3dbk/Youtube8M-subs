00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.730 
clip you see a glimpse of what appears
to<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.430> mech<00:01:53.820> factory<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> look

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to be a mech factory and if you look

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.060 
to be a mech factory and if you look
closely<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:57.330> mechs<00:01:57.570> frames<00:01:58.260> seem<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.980> be

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
closely the mechs frames seem to be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
closely the mechs frames seem to be
identical<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.790> those<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.720> ones<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.140> vail

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
identical to those of the ones in vail

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.120 
identical to those of the ones in vail
Phil<00:02:01.560> 2142<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:04.050> my<00:02:04.260> eyes<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
Phil 2142 so in my eyes this is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
Phil 2142 so in my eyes this is
definitely<00:02:05.610> leading<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> 2142

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
definitely leading up to with the 2142

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.850 
definitely leading up to with the 2142
sequel<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.920> battlefield<00:02:08.490> 24<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.540> sorry<00:02:10.080> 2143

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
