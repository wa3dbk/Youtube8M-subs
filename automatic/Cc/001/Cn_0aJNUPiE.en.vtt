00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hello guys, Joltter from Unisport WebTV - 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.640
 - and today we are going to Sweden to meet Pontus Jansson - 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.580
 - who is the 22-year-old defender from Malmö FF. 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.820
 We need to talk a little with him about football, - 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.260
 - football boots. 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.500
 Then we'll see him train - 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 - and handing him a pair of his favorite boots - 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.460
 - which is Puma EvoSpeed ​​1.2 - 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.680
 - who also got UniID embroidery. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 He does not know we are doing this, so let's see his reaction. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 We have just arrived at Malmö's stage - 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.220
 - In a few minutes we sit down with Pontus Jansson, ask him some questions - 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.930
 - and hopefully make some freestyle with him, 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 - Because I've let me tell you he's pretty good. 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.180
 They all say that ... 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.520
 I don't believe you Pontus! 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.060
 Yes, it's a great stage. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.120
 We sit here at Malmö FF's stadium, along with Pontus - 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.860
 - Nice to meet you, - 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.920
 - Shouldn't we speak Swedish? 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.200
 Yes, it sounds like a good idea. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.300
 Super. 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.900
 Okay, first question - 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.360
 - Why do you play in Puma evoSpeed? 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.940
 I always liked light boots - 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.000
 - Puma is also my sponsor and I have always liked them, especially now that they come with this evoSpeed, - 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.180
 - which I have been looking forward to for a long time. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.820
 What qualities do you like in a boot? 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.360
 Many of those you find in evoSpeed ​​actually. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.680
 I like lightweight boots and then I like the feeling of microfiber. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.720
 EvoSpeed ​​also comes in leather, but I prefer microfiber. 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.880
 So a light boot, with plenty of space, which is like this new evoSpeed. 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 Does the look of the boot mean anything? 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.740
 Yes, I think I like black or white boots. 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.750
 I've had green and pink boots before, but it's not really for me - 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.080
 - I like black or white better, which is why I like this new boot so much. 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.960
 Club that you dream of playing in? 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.600
 I have since dreamed of playing for Malmö FF and I do so now - 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.370
 - it has always been my dream, but of course you dream of more - 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.860
 - I always liked Dortmund - 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.200
 - It's just a dream and I'm very fond of Malmö FF, so we have to see how far it takes me. 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.860
 Who is the best player you played against and with? 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.620
 There I must say Milan with Zlatan. 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.840
 He's probably the best I've met, I've also played with him and I saw how good he was. 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.420
 I have to say Zlatan. 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.260
 Zlatan okay. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.370
 That was what I had, but not everything - 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.760
 - we have a small gift for you - 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.020
 - which is a brand new pair of Puma EvoSpeed. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.520
 Hope you like them. 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.740
 Yes man, thank you very much! 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740
 Thank you. 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.960
 Well, Pontus, I hear you're pretty good with the ball? 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.500
 I used to be anyway. 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.860
 Let's see what you can! 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.640
 Here! 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.440
 I'm going home and practicing - 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.440
 - but it was fun, mega fat - 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.780
 - also nice to meet you, hope you like the boots. 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.980
 Very fine, thank you. 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.840
 We are at Malmö's training facility, where Pontus and the other players train - 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.220
 - So it'll be fun to see how the pros do it. 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800
 It's time to shut down and shut down today - 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.080
 - It has been a great day here in Malmö
