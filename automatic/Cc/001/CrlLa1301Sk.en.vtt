00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
out I've got a trim plug the machine in

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.860 
out I've got a trim plug the machine in
just<00:00:55.730> give<00:00:55.910> me<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.030> second<00:00:56.390> okay<00:01:01.630> it's<00:01:02.630> plugged

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
just give me a second okay it's plugged

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.320 
just give me a second okay it's plugged
in<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.200> then<00:01:03.590> I'm<00:01:03.650> gonna<00:01:03.800> hit<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> hole<00:01:04.330> turn

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
in and then I'm gonna hit the hole turn

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.540 
in and then I'm gonna hit the hole turn
the<00:01:05.420> power<00:01:05.630> on<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.170> I'm<00:01:07.040> gonna<00:01:07.160> hit<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.369> hole

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.740 

all<00:02:01.310> right<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:05.119> definitely<00:02:05.479> gonna<00:02:05.659> be

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
all right so it's definitely gonna be

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.529 
all right so it's definitely gonna be
thicker<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.369> you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:07.970> see<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.209> right

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
thicker you can you can see that right

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.900 
thicker you can you can see that right
there<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.560> hard<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.920> maybe<00:02:10.100> see<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:10.759> it's

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
there it's hard to maybe see but it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.870 
there it's hard to maybe see but it's
it's<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.480> thicker<00:02:11.810> consistency<00:02:12.680> night<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.730> can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
it's a thicker consistency night you can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's a thicker consistency night you can
always<00:02:14.090> add<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:15.050> water<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.120> like

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
always add more water to it if you like

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150 
always add more water to it if you like
I<00:02:17.540> did<00:02:17.959> forget<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.319> put<00:02:18.530> vanilla<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.010> that's

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
I did forget to put vanilla but that's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.010 
I did forget to put vanilla but that's
okay

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
okay

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.570 
okay
I'm<00:02:21.020> going<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:23.150> use<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.130> because

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
I'm going to not use all of it because

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940 
I'm going to not use all of it because
I'm<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> bat<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.420> more<00:02:26.750> water<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.800> make

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
I'm going to bat at more water to make

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.860 
I'm going to bat at more water to make
the<00:02:28.069> rest<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.489> into<00:02:28.610> almond<00:02:29.000> milk<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:32.120> for

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the rest of it into almond milk but for

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.890 
the rest of it into almond milk but for
a<00:02:32.930> small<00:02:33.170> portion<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.390> maybe<00:02:35.390> I'll<00:02:35.630> pour

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
a small portion of it maybe I'll pour

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.560 
a small portion of it maybe I'll pour
out<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.230> portion<00:02:36.500> ahead<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.920> time<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.390> make

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
out that portion ahead of time you make

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.780 
out that portion ahead of time you make
a<00:02:41.600> portion<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.910> into<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.080> creamer

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
a portion of this into like a creamer

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.300 
a portion of this into like a creamer
which<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.940> don't<00:02:47.120> get<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.360> try<00:02:47.569> now<00:02:48.040> did<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.130> see

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
which I don't get to try now did you see

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.300 
which I don't get to try now did you see
that<00:02:49.459> how<00:02:49.910> thick<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.239> poor<00:02:50.690> kind<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.019> looked

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
that how thick that poor kind of looked

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.340 
that how thick that poor kind of looked
so<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:52.400> nice<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.970> might<00:02:53.780> add<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> bit<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.140> water

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
so it's nice I might add a bit of water

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.740 
so it's nice I might add a bit of water
to<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.650> once<00:02:54.920> I've<00:02:55.100> strained<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:55.850> I'm

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
to it once I've strained it but I'm

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.259 
to it once I've strained it but I'm
gonna<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.080> ahead<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.319> strain<00:02:58.160> that<00:03:01.269> by

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
gonna go ahead and strain that by

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:10.800 
gonna go ahead and strain that by
putting<00:03:02.920> my<00:03:03.920> little<00:03:05.350> straining<00:03:06.350> cloth<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.010> I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.789 

probably<00:03:11.810> could<00:03:12.079> have<00:03:12.110> added<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.470> bit<00:03:12.620> more

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
probably could have added a bit more

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:20.089 
probably could have added a bit more
water<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.340> seems<00:03:13.610> quite<00:03:13.820> thick

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.960 

and<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:20.969> weeks<00:03:21.390> here

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:33.270 

straighten<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.900> portion

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.670 

that's<00:03:33.940> not<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> lot<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:35.020> not<00:03:35.200> turning<00:03:35.470> into<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that's not a lot it's not turning into a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.140 
that's not a lot it's not turning into a
lot<00:03:35.830> which<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.070> fine<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.310> want<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.700> really<00:03:36.820> test

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
lot which is fine I want to really test

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.070 
lot which is fine I want to really test
this

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.660 

it<00:03:41.080> depends<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.560> well<00:03:41.740> how<00:03:41.980> thick<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.460> like

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
it depends as well how thick do you like

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.470 
it depends as well how thick do you like
your<00:03:42.850> cream<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:45.000> hope<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.240> see<00:03:46.360> they're

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
your cream I hope you can see they're

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.160 
your cream I hope you can see they're
just<00:03:46.510> straining<00:03:47.350> out<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.500> pulp<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.870> straining

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
just straining out the pulp it straining

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:03.400 
just straining out the pulp it straining
out<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.500> liquid<00:03:53.830> from<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.010> pulp

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.710 

that's<00:04:04.410> probably<00:04:04.920> about<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:09.410> there<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.500> go

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that's probably about it there we go

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.070 
that's probably about it there we go
and<00:04:14.320> it's<00:04:15.320> hard<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:16.100> baby<00:04:16.280> see<00:04:16.660> but<00:04:17.660> let's

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
and it's hard to to baby see but let's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.750 
and it's hard to to baby see but let's
look<00:04:18.230> at<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.440> like<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.580> I'm

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
look at it like this I think this is I'm

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.270 
look at it like this I think this is I'm
going<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:22.940> sample<00:04:23.390> this<00:04:26.230> it's<00:04:27.230> sweet<00:04:27.560> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
going to sample this it's sweet so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.070 
going to sample this it's sweet so
possibly<00:04:28.970> if<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.120> put<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.540> my<00:04:29.630> coffee<00:04:29.870> in

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
possibly if I put this in my coffee in

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.130 
possibly if I put this in my coffee in
the<00:04:30.110> morning<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:31.420> won't<00:04:32.420> even<00:04:32.570> need<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:33.020> add

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
the morning I won't even need to add

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.090 
the morning I won't even need to add
sweetener<00:04:35.140> this<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:36.320> thicker<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.920> good

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
sweetener this is thicker this is good

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.790 
sweetener this is thicker this is good
so<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:38.000> heavier<00:04:38.560> almond<00:04:39.560> milk

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
so this is like a a heavier almond milk

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.340 
so this is like a a heavier almond milk
cream<00:04:40.010> I'm<00:04:40.640> going<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.480> put<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> little

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350
