watch dr. lamb demonstrating this

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.500 
watch dr. lamb demonstrating this
movement<00:00:12.250> dr.<00:00:13.250> lamb<00:00:13.430> will<00:00:13.670> show<00:00:13.879> either<00:00:14.120> this

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
movement dr. lamb will show either this

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.200 
movement dr. lamb will show either this
movement<00:00:15.070> then<00:00:16.070> they<00:00:16.250> will<00:00:16.369> do<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.759> movements

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
movement then they will do the movements

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:30.890 
movement then they will do the movements
together<00:00:17.360> twice

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340 

standing<00:00:31.900> upright<00:00:32.379> without<00:00:32.890> being<00:00:33.550> tanks<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
standing upright without being tanks and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.479 
standing upright without being tanks and
so<00:00:36.160> your<00:00:37.030> body<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.540> string<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.530> gently

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
so your body is a string and gently

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.650 
so your body is a string and gently
stretch<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:40.059> but<00:00:40.989> not<00:00:41.260> being<00:00:41.620> things<00:00:42.660> fit

stretch it but not being things fit

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.509 
stretch it but not being things fit
together<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.960> universe<00:00:47.559> started<00:00:48.280> it

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
together when the universe started it

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.229 
together when the universe started it
was<00:00:48.970> in<00:00:49.239> one<00:00:49.629> in<00:00:50.079> dying<00:00:51.040> they<00:00:51.309> separate<00:00:51.850> into

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
was in one in dying they separate into

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.810 
was in one in dying they separate into
yin<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.839> yang<00:00:53.110> so<00:00:53.860> we're<00:00:54.070> going<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.339> separate

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
yin and yang so we're going to separate

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.069 
yin and yang so we're going to separate
our<00:00:55.000> feet<00:00:55.379> let<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.680> left<00:00:56.890> foot<00:00:57.190> up<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:58.079> then

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
our feet let the left foot up and then

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.090 
our feet let the left foot up and then
bring<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.589> left<00:00:59.829> foot<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.320> both
