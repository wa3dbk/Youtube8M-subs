00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello my name is svetlana i 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.000
 personal trainer 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.050
 Today I would like to tell everyone 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.670
 women how to remove the stomach after childbirth 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.099
 I just want to warn you right away 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.070
 after childbirth do not rush to rock 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 press it is fraught with consequences 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.789
 wait 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.369
 from one and a half to three months in order 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 to recover and abdominal wall for 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.300
 to be pulled together 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 muscles stretched during pregnancy and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.340
 internal organs all become on their 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.219
 places only after that can 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.079
 gradually start classes first 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 exercise that we wanted to show 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.800
 it is the simplest is the bike all 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.329
 probably everyone knows him 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 some few school in the classroom 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.960
 physical education 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 to start with it go to the floor you 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 rotate your legs a little work 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 press can do this for a while 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.989
 until you become hard ie 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.149
 too 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.360
 start planning yourself to do through 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.910
 force is not necessary this is the very first possible 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 do it let's say a week 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.210
 Well, 5 minutes they have several approaches 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.030
 to large does not matter 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.940
 perhaps it will be very easy for you therefore 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.540
 you can try to do the following 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540
 exercise 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 inhale exhale exhale exhale in this exercise 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.439
 the muscles are already working much more 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.750
 here you bring and foot you bring 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.640
 upper body after we 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 tried to do our second 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 exercise you need to move on 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.700
 next she has a little more 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:06.330
 harder we will simultaneously raise 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:11.880
 tighten your arms and legs again inhale 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:15.970
 exhale inhale exhale do this exercise 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.890
 several approaches can be increased 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 the number of repetitions that is, if 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.750
 let's say the first time you could 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.690
 make 10 try next time 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.140
 make 12-15 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.660
 and so on if you are already too easy 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.870
 you understand that you already have your muscles 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.220
 a little pumped here and let's say 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.310
 well, 150 and 300 times it's 7 long and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.200
 tiring then we turn still in 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.109
 more complex technology 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.320
 This exercise is also good because 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.780
 which will show now that we are more 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.750
 we will stress on 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.470
 the lower part of the press as a rule it is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 the most problem 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:07.230
 lie on your back raise your legs and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.920
 raise the pelvis tightened 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:16.740
 how to hip and we cut our press 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 at the same time the load falls the most 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:28.620
 the lower part can be the same exercise 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:36.660
 do with lifting spirit again exhale 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:38.130
 inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale inhale following 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.959
 exercises that I want to show you 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.360
 one of the most severe 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.760
 right away you won't be able to perform but when 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.540
 you will go through all the stages i think you yourself 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.459
 can handle 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.730
 she's good at working 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.010
 completely all the rectus abdominis muscle and gives 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.190
 very good exercise 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.470
 twisting note i 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.760
 I lift not only the shoulder blades I lift 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.090
 body while the hips do not break away from 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.090
 sex 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.359
 I'll just show how much it cuts 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:20.609
 muscle arm this is exactly the muscle 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.790
 which we are working on which will help 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.220
 make our belly flat and slim these 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.040
 exercise is best done daily 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.440
 because any process is important 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.860
 regularity and you will be slim 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.860
 beautiful healthy and attractive 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.860
 is always
