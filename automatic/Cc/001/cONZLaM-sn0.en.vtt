00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.949
 the encouragement they have between 16 and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.920
 19 years old and form the team of France who 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.140
 will compete in the next Olympic Games 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 without individual sport we have a lot 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.330
 it's team spirit and at the same time 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 the 24 hours finally almost 24 hours 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.740
 over 24 years are so it's true that it has 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 created links elegance and grace 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.850
 combined with the performance determination 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 yes that's right and gymnastics 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 artistic complex discipline made of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.880
 rigor and versatility in competition 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.130
 four events the uneven bars 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.260
 the beam the ground and the horse vault 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.500
 different universes and qualities 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 good tone is quite technical 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.909
 must be that at the same time enough 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 muscular gymnasts where trains 30 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.469
 hours each week of the sequences 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 and jumps to reproduce for 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.789
 bring closer to perfection 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.219
 there is the artistic aspect necessarily he 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.780
 is the acrobatic st is a factor 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.880
 that we often forget is like taking 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 huge risks make a double somersault 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 soil is not given to everyone 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.380
 looks like it's a bit like the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 downhill skiers who know that if they 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.780
 fall it's cash so you have to get 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.399
 pick up and start again tirelessly 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.619
 still elongated is found in his 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.399
 repeated efforts a pattern of 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 satisfaction 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.730
 a form of pleasure that we look 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.350
 because 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.510
 so a sensation that we do not have in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.010
 real life so it feels good to 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.690
 failure to feel for example in the air 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.630
 the table a feeling of flying 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.980
 support to remobilize for not 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.690
 miss the Olympic rendezvous 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.300
 because it may be for these young people 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.800
 women the last tribute not the piece 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.090
 every workout where we 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.940
 counted in the quest for a medal 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.160
 everything against the discipline the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.390
 determination even tenderness and one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.740
 wish them medals anyway 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.180
