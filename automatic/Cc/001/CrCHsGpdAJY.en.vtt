00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 good morning today we present one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 actually wakes up a digital clock with 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.070
 a hidden audio-guide micro-camera 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 inside as you can see the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.049
 appearance of a classic watch 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.779
 digital for anyone when they activate 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 here the date and time will appear and the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.720
 device temperature has a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 internal micro-camera with an opening 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 Wide-angle of 120 degrees to a crown 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 modified audio arriving at a distance 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 of about 10 meters 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 gives me the opportunity to insert 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 inside a microsd card up to 32 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 gb 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 as you can see you then open eter 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.820
 you have the memory input up to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 32gb one lever to activate e 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.309
 disable the micro camera an input 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.680
 microusb to upload and download that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.570
 that you have registered two batteries per 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 lithium that give you a great capacity 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 about 10 days of stand by and of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.320
 use based on how to use networks 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.900
 several days and here are the rates 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.700
 to set the date and time a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.270
 device is very simple to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 use and obviously can also be 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 then permanently connected to the current 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 you can also put it who knows 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 without having battery problems 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.690
 using a 32GB memory 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.730
 did not continue me one day 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.130
 movement even several days 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.800
 Simple to use device you have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 this supplied remote control that you 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 from the possibility of recording or col 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.480
 movement 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.990
 so when a forward face passes 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.070
 device records when it is not there 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.900
 no one stops or you can record 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 continued then start off decide 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.860
 you how much to stop you can register 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.990
 only wish therefore you have one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.920

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.400
