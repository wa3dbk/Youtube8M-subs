00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so the first thing I'm going to do with

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.830 
so the first thing I'm going to do with
this<00:01:33.450> file<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:35.360> image<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this file with this image is to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.820 
this file with this image is to
rasterize<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.490 

and<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.720> will<00:01:41.720> set<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.050> background<00:01:42.230> ass

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
and I will set the background ass

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800 
and I will set the background ass
transplant<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.850> resolution<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.510> very

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
transplant and the resolution is very

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
transplant and the resolution is very
fine<00:01:45.500> at<00:01:45.680> 300<00:01:46.640> PPI<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.470> hit<00:01:48.470> okay<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:50.440> on<00:01:51.440> top<00:01:51.680> of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
fine at 300 PPI I hit okay and on top of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.800 
fine at 300 PPI I hit okay and on top of
this<00:01:52.010> layer<00:01:52.280> I'm<00:01:52.520> going<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.880> create<00:01:53.120> a<00:01:53.300> second

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
this layer I'm going to create a second

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.470 
this layer I'm going to create a second
layer<00:01:54.640> let's<00:01:55.640> change<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.000> color<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.270> this

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
layer let's change the color of this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.660 
layer let's change the color of this
layer<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.920> blue<00:01:58.090> okay<00:01:59.440> and<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:01.040> will<00:02:01.280> block<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
layer to blue okay and I will block the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.760 
layer to blue okay and I will block the
first<00:02:01.820> layer<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.360> make<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.230> second<00:02:03.620> layer

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
first layer and make the second layer

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.889 
first layer and make the second layer
active<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:07.000> will<00:02:08.000> use<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.300> pencil<00:02:08.660> tool<00:02:08.869> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
active and I will use the pencil tool to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.910 
active and I will use the pencil tool to
create<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:13.480> stroke

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.470 

over<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.240> snowboarder<00:02:20.460> because<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:22.240> will

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
over the snowboarder because this will

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.010 
over the snowboarder because this will
dictate<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.200> way<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.980> video<00:02:24.430> scribe

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
dictate the way the video scribe

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.900 
dictate the way the video scribe
software<00:02:26.020> will<00:02:26.200> render<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.860> image<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.620> let's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
software will render this image so let's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.809 
software will render this image so let's
just<00:02:31.110> make<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.590> stroke<00:02:33.220> over<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
just make this stroke over the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.810 
just make this stroke over the
snowboarder<00:02:34.600> I'm<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.470> randomly<00:02:36.040> drawing

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
snowboarder I'm just randomly drawing

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.690 
snowboarder I'm just randomly drawing
over<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:38.280> okay<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.220> needed<00:02:42.430> to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
over this okay and I just needed to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.310 
over this okay and I just needed to
cover<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.300> entire<00:02:43.750> image<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
cover the entire image of the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.380 
cover the entire image of the
snowboarder<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:46.620> will<00:02:47.620> also<00:02:48.040> change<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
snowboarder I will also change the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.290 
snowboarder I will also change the
stroke<00:02:49.930> cap<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.590> corners<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.650> this

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.970 

is<00:02:59.810> pretty<00:03:00.290> good<00:03:00.800> almost<00:03:01.310> there

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.009 

you<00:03:05.519> need<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.730> make<00:03:05.909> sure<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.510> entire<00:03:06.629> image

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
you need to make sure the entire image

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.199 
you need to make sure the entire image
is<00:03:08.030> really<00:03:09.030> well<00:03:09.239> covered<00:03:09.569> by<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.700> stroke

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
is really well covered by the stroke

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.729 
is really well covered by the stroke
because<00:03:13.819> if<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.000> isn't<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.690> will<00:03:15.720> look<00:03:16.470> bad

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
because if it isn't it will look bad

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.690 
because if it isn't it will look bad
when<00:03:17.250> imported<00:03:17.849> inside<00:03:18.000> videoscribe<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
when imported inside videoscribe and the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.699 
when imported inside videoscribe and the
last<00:03:20.909> thing<00:03:21.150> we'll<00:03:21.299> do<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.290> change<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
last thing we'll do is to change the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.039 
last thing we'll do is to change the
opacity<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.549> stroke<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.690> make<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.650> zero

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
opacity of this stroke and make it zero

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.800 
opacity of this stroke and make it zero
or<00:03:28.049> fully<00:03:28.470> transparent<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.400> now<00:03:30.239> let's<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
or fully transparent and now let's just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.780 
or fully transparent and now let's just
save<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.470> image<00:03:33.140> save<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.709> inside

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
use for the image location in bed

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.619 
use for the image location in bed
because<00:03:57.950> when<00:03:58.950> we<00:03:59.099> rasterized<00:03:59.609> this<00:04:00.060> image<00:04:00.390> we

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
because when we rasterized this image we

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.400 
because when we rasterized this image we
created<00:04:01.079> an<00:04:01.940> PNG<00:04:02.940> file<00:04:03.180> which<00:04:04.019> will<00:04:04.230> be

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
created an PNG file which will be

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.869 
created an PNG file which will be
embedded<00:04:04.680> inside<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:06.750> SVG<00:04:07.410> file<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.849> now

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
embedded inside this SVG file so now

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.860 
embedded inside this SVG file so now
just<00:04:09.299> hit<00:04:09.569> OK<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.139> leave<00:04:10.530> everything<00:04:10.859> else<00:04:11.130> to
