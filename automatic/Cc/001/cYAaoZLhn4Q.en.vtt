00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
won't walk do hakuna graph so you would

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.979 
won't walk do hakuna graph so you would
try<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> graph<00:00:50.010> passing<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.640> anymore<00:00:51.030> yeah

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
try to graph passing this anymore yeah

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.590 
try to graph passing this anymore yeah
there<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.409> go

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.599 
pocket shot marshmallow chronograph test
take<00:00:56.519> one

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.020 

215<00:01:02.609> feet<00:01:02.969> per<00:01:03.600> second<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.220> marshmallow<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
215 feet per second with a marshmallow I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.150 
215 feet per second with a marshmallow I
don't<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.360> it'll<00:01:06.660> be<00:01:06.720> hit<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.460> yeah

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
don't think it'll be hit with it yeah

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.230 
don't think it'll be hit with it yeah
let's<00:01:11.160> try<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.460> again<00:01:12.470> take<00:01:13.470> two<00:01:16.970> 225<00:01:17.970> feet

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
let's try that again take two 225 feet

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.440 
let's try that again take two 225 feet
per<00:01:18.450> second<00:01:18.870> cool<00:01:19.440> in<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.620> marshmallow<00:01:20.300> okay<00:01:21.300> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
per second cool in a marshmallow okay so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.030 
per second cool in a marshmallow okay so
we're<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.660> see<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.260> this<00:01:22.350> mini<00:01:22.620> boat<00:01:22.830> can

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we're gonna see what this mini boat can

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.250 
we're gonna see what this mini boat can
do<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> coronagraph

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.810 

nothing<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:28.800> nothing<00:01:31.490> yeah<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> don't

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
nothing it did nothing yeah I don't

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
nothing it did nothing yeah I don't
think<00:01:32.940> that's<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.180> register

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
think that's gonna register

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.990 
think that's gonna register
I<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.370> maybe<00:01:37.100> seven<00:01:38.100> feet<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I think we got maybe seven feet out of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
I think we got maybe seven feet out of
it<00:01:39.120> distance<00:01:39.840> wise<00:01:40.080> yeah<00:01:40.610> alright<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it distance wise yeah alright so you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
it distance wise yeah alright so you
probably<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.480> want<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.990> shot<00:01:43.230> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020 
probably don't want to get shot with
this<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:43.980> it'll<00:01:44.250> hurt<00:01:44.400> even<00:01:44.670> though<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
