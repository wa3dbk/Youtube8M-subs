00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 big bigger Biggest 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 that is the motto of planetside 2 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.710
 be that if one out immediately 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 then stands out in scale on which we in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.730
 Sony's online free to play game battles 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.930
 deliver 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.580
 however, the unusual stuff 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 multiplayer shooter as well some 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 problemchen his progress all 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 inaccessibility at the end of our test 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 However, everyone should watch videos 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:36.690
 have understood what it is in the core in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 planetside 2 is yes planetside 2 has 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.710
 a background story that plays 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.579
 but absolutely no role for that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.320
 game happen 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 who cares anyway 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.920
 may the official planetside 2 please 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 wiki to rate pull 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.899
 Gameplay, please, in principle 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 small time two is different 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.460
 not great of games like 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 Battlefield 3 on foot in vehicles or 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 In the air we kill battles 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.360
 important node points that can be so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.530
 be small outpost like here or 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.760
 huge bases like this biolab 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.619
 depending on the size, there is one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 or more points we in 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.490
 battlefield manner must take 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.700
 stand next to it then changes the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.350
 Checkpoint slowly the owner 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 Let's keep enough checkpoints going 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.369
 slowly but surely the complete base 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 in our possession and we can 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.540
 to use it as a starting point in the future 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.880
 and at special terminals driving and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.390
 board planes and where they are 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 then on to the next base to the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.450
 next and eventually back 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 for the first because that's the special 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 distant time 2 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.490
 the battle never stops we fight 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.040
 Constantly on the control over 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.470
 more areas than ours 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.750
 there should only be a rounding 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.310
 smear server times 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.050
 every one of us controlled facility 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.000
 can also be taken again 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.580
 with the exception of our headquarters 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 which of the three fractions planetside 2 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.630
 just what dominates areas 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.130
 simply by looking up 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.030
 the practical overview card 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 determine 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.250
 red colored areas are under the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.260
 control of teran republic blue heard 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.050
 to the new conglomerate and purple is the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.820
 color of train station every fraction 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.130
 has the same six 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.160
 infantry classes 1 saw them 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.050
 engineer at the core of rocket launcher that 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.740
 usual just here there are no big ones 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.709
 surprises 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.530
 only the max units stand out 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.380
 These are big mac tanks that much 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.030
 endure and hand out immortal 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.600
 but they are not like us 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.730
 Impressively put under proof 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.100
 the biggest problem of planetside 2 is 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.650
 currently the entry will be new players 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.550
 for such a complex game far too little 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.470
 taken to the hand 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.510
 with a newly created character 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.820
 we will just like that without a comment 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.519
 Apart from this little video that 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.019
 ask more questions than answered 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.300
 thrown over a battle 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.640
 the only help can be 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.860
 youtube or find in the official forum 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.200
 but mostly in English and sometimes 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.880
 honestly who once left alone 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.820
 Feel uninstalled a free to play 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.360
 he title as i about youtube help too 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.000
 search 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.400
 why we have one basis after the other 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.989
 fighting has a simple reason every 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.209
 Facility promotes one in three 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.700
 resources and we need them again 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.769
 to buy us driving and planes or 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.750
 even such essential things as grenades 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.290
 the fraction with the most resources 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.880
 So has the best cards in the fight 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.220
 and when she plays that out in the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.110
 support something like from above 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.880
 hunt flyer and bomber armor and 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.190
 troop transporter in their foray 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.200
 a support point behind it is the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.239
 infantry he will find such attacks 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.530
 a time two regularly and 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.840
 It is always awe 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.910
 commanding sight in things butchering 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.000
 atmosphere there are few games the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.800
 can compete with planetside 2 one 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.900
 because of the beta phase 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.910
 not so easy meanwhile has sony 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.069
 online but some mechanisms built in 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.290
 to ease the way to the fight 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.810
 One possibility is the direct entry 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.709
 but only every 15 minutes to 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.200
 available 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.480
 we will be comfortable with that 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 thrown off the front line and can 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.169
 us right in the battle to overthrow 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.389
 find out where exactly the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.040
 Most opponents stop there 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.470
 some hidden option on the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.840
 Survey card there can be namely 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.820
 turn on two different modes 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.220
 it will be the area control 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.590
 displayed or this extremely 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.660
 practical heat card the redder the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.560
 appropriate area the more enemies 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.540
 frolic around there 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.340
 and where most enemies are 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.800
 usually also happens right now 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.780
 fought city ​​and finally the 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.729
 Perhaps the most important note one should 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.130
 be sure to join a squad 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.620
 the best one is the teamplay or something 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.300
 First of all it is a light one 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.250
 to find the fight by simply 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.380
 running after his sports mate 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.500
 second, there are more points and 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.000
 third, one is reasonably in one 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.750
 organized group significantly more effective 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.910
 as alone 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.830
 that these outposts are ours 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.800
 Above all, it is the merit of ours 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.360
 Quads if you only have a few hours 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.310
 spent in planetside 2 and 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.630
 everything starts to look 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.330
 then it starts with these 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.250
 unforgettable planetside moments like 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.900
 the one time as we on the way to 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.820
 an outpost suddenly submerged 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.620
 hit by a bomber and only 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.110
 but the basis is scarcely escaped 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.419
 still have taken or 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.250
 lately, as we up with our dropout 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.740
 landed as a bomber 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.450
 what kills the bomber crew though 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.320
 also and also something fun 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.940
 or how stupid 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.770
 Soldier our hunting flyer almost 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.320
 but then escape would be the 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.260
 has drawn shorter still remains a 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.750
 unpleasant topic to deal with in 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.580
 Game shop takes place since two is free to 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.390
 play and somehow it must be safe 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.940
 finance 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.190
 beforehand all game relevant 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.210
 Items therefore about new arms armor 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.220
 improvements or weapons 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.720
 Modifications can also be done without 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.820
 free play real money 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.500
 but that takes quite a bit longer than that 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.870
 prices are currently very high 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.330
 Given categories can be small 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.890
 time two so do not blame the 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.960
 Prices in the shop should, however 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.260
 still regulated a bit 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.260
 become 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.100
 whether during the day or at night 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.830
 sunrise or sunset no matter on 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.170
 which continent sees planetside 2 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.550
 great 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.290
 especially at night unfolds in 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.140
 big battles a veritable 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.300
 effect thunders who are high in one 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.190
 plane gets its round pulls from 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.320
 the whole graphic splendor but not 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.960
 so much with the game dazzles in the 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.330
 Distant a lot of details out too 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.820
 soundtechnisch dense planetside 2 forth 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.520
 All vehicles and weapons 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.590
 Projectiles have their own easily 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.420
 again had noticeable effect at first 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.910
 to fight the game with strong leaks 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.710
 what about such floating soldiers 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.600
 In the meantime, these are 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.610
 problems but largely history 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.610
 and everything works as it should 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.350
 his time 2 currently has one 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.410
 big problem 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.600
 the entry into the online a bit 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.730
 that could make it more intuitive 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.980
 be very successful for it 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.200
 Doing so much right in slaughter 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.740
 each scale different driving and 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.020
 aircraft 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.980
 three different factions and that 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.140
 everything for free 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.520
 fans of multiplayer should shoot 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.270
 the title in any case once 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.270
 take a closer look
