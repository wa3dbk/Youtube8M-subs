00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:15.240
 hi hi hi guys came and shoot a non video 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.150
 Lucas did not hit me in this makeup. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 Did you see some artists on the internet? 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 posted the photos with the black eye 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 is a form of manifest in relation to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 to police violence 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 I live in the city of 75 thousand inhabitants who 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 do not have transportation because she will not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 stop then we find a way to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 try to help in protest 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.770
 so I decided to put something together and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.399
 I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.960
 I look at the last one for whoever wants it too 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 participate in the protest and also take 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.629
 Photograph 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 so I never left my booth power 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 so I 'm going to use this word I had to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 from catharine hill or if you have 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.079
 can be any other shadow 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.549
 basically it will need a shade 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.920
 purple wine half a black shadow one 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.390
 yellow and green there may be 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 You want but you do not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.000
 have caused you to have 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.799
 so I'll start with the purple shadow with 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 a normal eye shadow brush I 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.560
 I'll start right here in the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.560
 inner corner of the eye 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.360
 how to avoid a black eye 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.579
 does not need to be very perfect 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.420
 and there you go doing around the eye 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.580
 arriving mainly this part had 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:00.600
 here at the very beginning and then you see 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.060
 with your finger and you are giving a 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.060
 faded to kind of soften and stay more 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 Natural 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 There with the same shadow today I'm going to make a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 little here in the corner of the eye but the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
 format is at the discretion of each 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.450
 so not in a very accurate way 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.190
 around with the black shadow I'll get I 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.700
 choose a little more here in the beginning 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 of the eye 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.359
 that in the end it's all the same now 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:56.040
 in those spaces that did not stay with 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:58.950
 shadow you come with the yellow shadow and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.469
 pass and then follow the green and go 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.299
 completing the spaces making type 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.939
 a gradient because they killed so they have 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:15.569
 half purple yellow green a little bit of 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:17.870
 You can play with these subjects. 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.870
 Colors 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.880
 before hit with affection 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.910
 and if you want, you can spend a 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.020
 little of the shadow here touches the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.970
 side of the other because it considers 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.330
 A punch but it will pass lighter just to 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.330
 stay 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.580
 diet with a lot of stick face 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.180
 Look respect is only to use eye couple 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.520
 purple 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.410
 There you go and play with the color you do not have 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.510
 a lot of rules of how to do it in me 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.180
 You guys do your makeup after you 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.640
 take your photo and buggy on the nets 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.640
 wherever you want 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.480
 and that's it until the next video until the 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 next portals in ja√∫
