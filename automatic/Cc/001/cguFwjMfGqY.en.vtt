00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
six five six five six seven and now this

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:45.630 
six five six five six seven and now this
is<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.069> Big<00:02:45.250> Finish

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
is the Big Finish

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240 
is the Big Finish
okay<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:46.989> we<00:02:47.140> go<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.860> you're<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.190> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
okay so here we go what you're going to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.589 
okay so here we go what you're going to
do<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.640> you're<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:48.910> going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.299> two

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
do is you're actually going to do two

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.930 
do is you're actually going to do two
triple<00:02:49.989> let's<00:02:50.140> into<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> five<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.370> they're<00:02:51.730> all

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
triple let's into a five and they're all

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.630 
triple let's into a five and they're all
going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.390> start<00:02:52.629> with<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> clump<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.489> you're

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
going to start with a clump so you're

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.470 
going to start with a clump so you're
going<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.819> go<00:02:55.079> 1<00:02:56.079> 2<00:02:56.350> 3<00:02:56.530> 1<00:02:57.519> 2<00:02:57.760> 3<00:02:57.910> 1<00:02:58.690> 2<00:02:58.900> 3<00:02:59.290> 4<00:03:00.190> 5<00:03:00.579> so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
going to go 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 so

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.140 
going to go 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 so
right<00:03:01.690> after<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.989> do<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.260> 5<00:03:02.620> right<00:03:02.980> here

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
right after you do that 5 right here

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.240 
right after you do that 5 right here
what<00:03:04.150> you're<00:03:04.269> going<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.569> is<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> double<00:03:05.250> into

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
what you're going to do is a double into

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.080 
what you're going to do is a double into
a<00:03:06.280> Handclap<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.380> then<00:03:08.380> we're<00:03:08.560> done<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.940> it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
a Handclap and then we're done so it

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.920 
a Handclap and then we're done so it
goes<00:03:13.299> five<00:03:14.019> six<00:03:14.709> seven<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.760> one<00:03:16.269> two<00:03:16.599> three

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
goes five six seven and one two three

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.949 
goes five six seven and one two three
one<00:03:17.500> two<00:03:17.650> three<00:03:17.950> one<00:03:18.519> two<00:03:18.700> three<00:03:18.970> four<00:03:19.660> five

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
one two three one two three four five

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.339 
one two three one two three four five
double<00:03:20.620> five<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:22.239> we<00:03:22.359> do<00:03:22.510> after<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
double five what we do after this if you

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.099 
double five what we do after this if you
just<00:03:23.590> start<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.160> step<00:03:24.340> over<00:03:24.549> again<00:03:25.060> okay<00:03:25.870> so

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
just start to step over again okay so

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.069 
just start to step over again okay so
after<00:03:26.829> we<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.639> we<00:03:28.030> begin<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.540> step<00:03:28.720> we

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
after we do this we begin to step we

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.460 
after we do this we begin to step we
loop<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.500> okay<00:03:30.069> so<00:03:30.579> it's<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:30.910> go<00:03:31.090> 1<00:03:31.660> 2<00:03:32.019> 3<00:03:32.049> 1

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
loop it okay so it's going to go 1 2 3 1

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:46.670 
loop it okay so it's going to go 1 2 3 1
2<00:03:33.040> 3<00:03:33.160> 1<00:03:33.819> 2<00:03:34.150> 3<00:03:34.299> 4<00:03:35.019> 5<00:03:35.669> 5<00:03:36.669> again

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.170 

heymy<00:03:47.680> what<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:51.430> finished<00:03:51.760> off<00:03:51.910> with<00:03:51.940> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
heymy what we finished off with that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.920 
heymy what we finished off with that
stage<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.670> okay<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.780> how

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
stage just like that okay and that's how

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.230 
stage just like that okay and that's how
we're<00:03:56.080> going<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.490> let's<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.910> slow

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
we're going to do it so let's do it slow

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.750 
we're going to do it so let's do it slow
and<00:03:58.570> then<00:03:59.560> me<00:03:59.740> and<00:03:59.860> ask<00:04:00.040> we'll<00:04:00.310> do<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.490> little

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
and then me and ask we'll do a little

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160 
and then me and ask we'll do a little
bit<00:04:00.880> more<00:04:00.910> fast<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.420> little<00:04:01.570> bit<00:04:01.660> more<00:04:01.780> flavor<00:04:02.050> a

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
bit more fast a little bit more flavor a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.830 
bit more fast a little bit more flavor a
little<00:04:02.350> more<00:04:02.470> fallout<00:04:02.770> five<00:04:03.760> six<00:04:04.480> get

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
little more fallout five six get

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:29.460 
little more fallout five six get
grounded<00:04:05.320> here<00:04:05.530> we<00:04:05.680> go<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:28.200> now<00:04:29.200> we're<00:04:29.320> gonna

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
grounded here we go and now we're gonna

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:53.130 
grounded here we go and now we're gonna
do<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.560> fallout<00:04:29.800> five<00:04:30.660> six<00:04:31.890> five<00:04:32.890> six<00:04:33.190> five<00:04:33.760> six

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.150 

and<00:04:54.140> that's<00:04:54.800> how<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.160> do<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.900> step<00:04:57.160> influenced

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
and that's how you do a step influenced

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.430 
and that's how you do a step influenced
by<00:04:59.120> Latin<00:05:00.430> movement
