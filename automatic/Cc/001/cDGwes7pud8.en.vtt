00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
taiko drumming so they mix it with an

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
taiko drumming so they mix it with an
element<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.180> music<00:01:18.180> simulation<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> grade<00:01:18.930> 21

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.580 
Japan so this game works on a bunch of
sensors<00:06:20.400> above<00:06:21.000> you<00:06:21.180> which<00:06:21.690> react<00:06:22.050> to<00:06:22.229> sensors

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
sensors above you which react to sensors

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.779 
sensors above you which react to sensors
below<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:22.919> so<00:06:23.159> when<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:23.310> stand<00:06:23.550> in<00:06:23.669> the

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
below you so when you stand in the

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.270 
below you so when you stand in the
center<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.539> replicate<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.590> patterns<00:06:26.039> it

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
center and you replicate the patterns it

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.649 
center and you replicate the patterns it
will<00:06:26.400> great<00:06:26.639> join<00:06:26.819> your<00:06:27.000> accuracy<00:06:27.330> because<00:06:27.569> it

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
will great join your accuracy because it

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.540 
will great join your accuracy because it
knows<00:06:27.780> where<00:06:28.020> what<00:06:28.229> arm<00:06:28.440> should<00:06:29.009> be<00:06:29.190> at<00:06:29.400> what

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
knows where what arm should be at what

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.459 
knows where what arm should be at what
point<00:06:29.819> and<00:06:30.060> that<00:06:30.090> way<00:06:30.599> over<00:06:30.750> H<00:06:30.930> on<00:06:31.110> how<00:06:31.259> well

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
point and that way over H on how well

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:32.719 
point and that way over H on how well
you're<00:06:31.590> actually<00:06:31.740> following<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.430> routine

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
you're actually following the routine

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.610 
you're actually following the routine
correctly<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.690> course<00:06:33.990> if<00:06:34.139> you<00:06:34.229> don't<00:06:34.259> want<00:06:34.469> to

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
correctly of course if you don't want to

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.779 
correctly of course if you don't want to
learn<00:06:34.710> the<00:06:34.860> routine<00:06:35.159> you<00:06:35.370> can<00:06:35.490> actually<00:06:35.610> just

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
learn the routine you can actually just

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.730 
learn the routine you can actually just
follow<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.210> arrows<00:06:36.419> on<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.569> screen<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.560> you

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
follow the arrows on the screen and you

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.499 
follow the arrows on the screen and you
can<00:06:37.860> great<00:06:38.129> join<00:06:38.370> your<00:06:38.550> accuracy<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.270> it<00:06:39.389> does

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
can great join your accuracy and it does

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.809 
can great join your accuracy and it does
have<00:06:39.659> a<00:06:39.690> mode<00:06:39.900> just<00:06:40.110> for<00:06:40.439> for<00:06:41.039> PA<00:06:41.250> for<00:06:41.610> people

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
have a mode just for for PA for people

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.950 
have a mode just for for PA for people
to<00:06:41.879> want<00:06:41.939> to<00:06:42.060> do<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.240> routines<00:06:42.539> but<00:06:42.659> they<00:06:42.779> want

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
to want to do the routines but they want

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.450 
to want to do the routines but they want
to<00:06:43.020> play<00:06:43.139> and<00:06:43.379> be<00:06:43.409> greater<00:06:43.680> on<00:06:43.860> accuracy<00:06:44.189> so

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
to play and be greater on accuracy so

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.649 
to play and be greater on accuracy so
they<00:06:44.550> do<00:06:44.610> have<00:06:44.909> a<00:06:45.840> lot<00:06:46.740> of<00:06:47.180> votes<00:06:48.180> for<00:06:48.360> that<00:06:48.389> so

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
they do have a lot of votes for that so

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.209 
they do have a lot of votes for that so
that<00:06:48.779> people<00:06:49.110> will<00:06:49.319> be<00:06:49.379> able<00:06:49.560> to<00:06:49.979> play<00:06:50.099> without

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
that people will be able to play without

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:52.010 
that people will be able to play without
learning<00:06:50.460> the<00:06:50.639> routines<00:06:50.969> all<00:06:51.479> the<00:06:51.690> music<00:06:51.930> in

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.629 
notice that all the music and initial d
is<00:07:00.779> zero<00:07:00.960> beat<00:07:01.169> so<00:07:01.379> initial<00:07:01.800> d<00:07:01.889> fans<00:07:02.159> will

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
is zero beat so initial d fans will

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.920 
is zero beat so initial d fans will
immediately<00:07:02.819> recognize<00:07:03.150> the<00:07:03.539> music<00:07:03.810> in<00:07:03.900> this

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
immediately recognize the music in this

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.639 
immediately recognize the music in this
game<00:07:04.080> and<00:07:04.319> the<00:07:04.409> 2-2<00:07:04.740> tie<00:07:04.949> in<00:07:04.979> together<00:07:05.279> nicely
