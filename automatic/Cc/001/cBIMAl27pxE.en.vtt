00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
let's change straight away I had more

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.100 
let's change straight away I had more
power<00:01:28.640> than<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.790> we

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
power than what we

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.650 
power than what we
so<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.610> certainly<00:01:31.850> takes<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.330> box<00:01:32.540> that

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
so that certainly takes the box that
