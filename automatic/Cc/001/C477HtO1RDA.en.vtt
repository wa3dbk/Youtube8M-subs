you fold it back into a book mode this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
you fold it back into a book mode this
is<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> look<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:03.240> too

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is what it's going to look like not too

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
is what it's going to look like not too
much<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> bulk<00:02:04.110> department<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
much in the bulk department and it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.649 
much in the bulk department and it
certainly<00:02:05.399> isn't<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.210> your<00:02:06.360> device

to<00:02:06.689> sleep<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.369> open<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to sleep this will open up like this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
to sleep this will open up like this
you've<00:02:09.390> got<00:02:09.420> full<00:02:09.810> back<00:02:10.050> coverage<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
way that this works is it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.320 
way that this works is it
kind<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.190> relies<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.790> weight<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
kind of relies on the weight and the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.479 
kind of relies on the weight and the
stand<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.019> kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.709> texturized

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
stand and kind of this texturized

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.509 
stand and kind of this texturized
interior<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.900> hold<00:02:19.140> itself<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.860> place<00:02:20.129> now

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519

whereas<00:02:21.390> I've<00:02:21.720> reviewed<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> ipad<00:02:22.950> air

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
whereas I've reviewed the ipad air

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 
whereas I've reviewed the ipad air
version<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.480> falls<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.989> of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
version of this and it falls out of

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.649 
version of this and it falls out of
place<00:02:25.500> probably<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.220> its<00:02:26.489> size<00:02:26.760> this

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
place probably because of its size this

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.420 
place probably because of its size this
one<00:02:27.900> actually<00:02:28.049> holds<00:02:28.590> its<00:02:28.769> place<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> lot

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
one actually holds its place a lot

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.089 
one actually holds its place a lot
better<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:31.019> know<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> lot<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.440> tapping<00:02:31.980> on

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
better now you know a lot of tapping on

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.860 
better now you know a lot of tapping on
it<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.430> some<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.760> these<00:02:32.849> smaller<00:02:33.209> positions

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it and some of these smaller positions

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110 
it and some of these smaller positions
will<00:02:34.170> cause<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.709> slip<00:02:35.280> slightly<00:02:35.910> out<00:02:36.090> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
will cause it to slip slightly out of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.150 
will cause it to slip slightly out of
position<00:02:36.450> that's<00:02:36.930> still<00:02:37.230> an<00:02:37.410> issue<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.920> this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
position that's still an issue with this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
position that's still an issue with this
case<00:02:38.430> especially<00:02:39.060> as<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.569> go<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.720> little<00:02:39.930> bit

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
case especially as you go a little bit

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.740 
case especially as you go a little bit
lower<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.190> nothing<00:02:41.459> too<00:02:41.940> terrible<00:02:42.239> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
lower but it's nothing too terrible and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
lower but it's nothing too terrible and
certainly<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.129> pick<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.489> case<00:02:44.790> up

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
certainly if you can pick this case up

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
certainly if you can pick this case up
for<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.750> price<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.019> about<00:02:46.319> 699<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.700> it's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
for the price of about 699 I think it's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.390
