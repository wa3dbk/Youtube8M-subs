00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
kind of have some things that need to be

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.849 
kind of have some things that need to be
addressed<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.029> off<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> bat<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.769> know

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
addressed right off the bat and you know

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
addressed right off the bat and you know
for<00:00:26.070> an<00:00:26.369> adventure<00:00:26.849> ride<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
for an adventure ride and we're going to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.210 
for an adventure ride and we're going to
see<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:28.590> dirt

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
see some dirt

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.269 
see some dirt
probably<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.029> dirt<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.269> pavement<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.279> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
probably more dirt than pavement and so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
probably more dirt than pavement and so
we've<00:00:32.460> made<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.850> changes<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
we've made some changes and some of the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
we've made some changes and some of the
changes<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.350> made<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> bike<00:00:35.010> obviously

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
changes we made to this bike obviously

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020 
changes we made to this bike obviously
the<00:00:36.120> tires<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:37.350> running<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.710> Pirelli<00:00:38.340> Mt

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the tires we're running some Pirelli Mt

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.139 
the tires we're running some Pirelli Mt
21s<00:00:39.750> front<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.140> rear<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.980> heavy-duty<00:00:41.640> tube<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
21s front and rear a heavy-duty tube is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
21s front and rear a heavy-duty tube is
also<00:00:42.480> important<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> heavy-duty

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
also important so we have a heavy-duty

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.139 
also important so we have a heavy-duty
tubes<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:46.170> also<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> rim<00:00:47.610> lock<00:00:47.820> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
tubes in them we also have a rim lock on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
tubes in them we also have a rim lock on
the<00:00:48.360> rear<00:00:48.570> tire<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> wider<00:00:50.010> rim<00:00:50.340> lock<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the rear tire it's a wider rim lock it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.819 
the rear tire it's a wider rim lock it
keeps<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> tire<00:00:51.360> from<00:00:51.629> spinning<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> rim

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
keeps the tire from spinning on the rim

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.930 
keeps the tire from spinning on the rim
and<00:00:54.110> flatting<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.260> tube<00:00:55.670> some<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> other

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and flatting your tube some of the other

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840 
and flatting your tube some of the other
things<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.449> bike<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.800> s<00:00:59.219> wmo

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
things on this bike we put some s wmo

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.009 
things on this bike we put some s wmo
tech<00:01:00.120> crash<00:01:00.719> bars<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
tech crash bars on it just because the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
tech crash bars on it just because the
shrouds<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:05.220> expensive<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.090> there's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
shrouds are pretty expensive and there's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
shrouds are pretty expensive and there's
a<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.750> chance<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> bike<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.830> get

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a good chance that the bike will get

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
a good chance that the bike will get
laid<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> side<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:08.939> point

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
laid on the side at some point

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
laid on the side at some point
another<00:01:10.830> important<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.670> bikes<00:01:11.880> were

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
another important thing these bikes were

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
another important thing these bikes were
pretty<00:01:12.240> low<00:01:12.390> slung<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.409> skid<00:01:13.770> plate<00:01:13.799> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pretty low slung so a skid plate is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.810 
pretty low slung so a skid plate is
really<00:01:14.310> important<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
really important we actually have a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.190 
really important we actually have a
we've<00:01:17.820> been<00:01:18.119> talking<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> ricochet<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.080> we've

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we've been talking to ricochet and we've

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
we've been talking to ricochet and we've
we've<00:01:19.619> carried<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> new

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we've carried one but they have a new

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
we've carried one but they have a new
one<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> work<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> SW<00:01:22.350> MO<00:01:22.500> tech

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
one out to the work with the SW MO tech

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.410 
one out to the work with the SW MO tech
crash<00:01:23.490> bars<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.420> we'll<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:25.140> having<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.619> soon

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
crash bars so we'll be having that soon

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.760 
crash bars so we'll be having that soon
something<00:01:27.420> else<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> foot<00:01:28.140> pegs<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.590> this

something else is the foot pegs on this
bike<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.610> IMS<00:01:30.180> foot<00:01:30.479> pegs<00:01:30.720> give<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> really
