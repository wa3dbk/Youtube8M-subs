00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.059
 many people come to a farm 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.120
 of horses or at an auction with the goal 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.120
 to buy a beautiful and gentle horse 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.650
 regardless of the price you can 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 getting to pay is important to understand 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.489
 that is not always a well-trained animal 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.519
 it is sufficiently meek and that i 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.400
 Meek horses are not always well 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.560
 tamed 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.380
 we believe it is useful to clarify this 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.960
 point because often those who enter the world 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.140
 of riding with a great desire to 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.430
 you can own your first horse 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.690
 feel confused about it when there 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.490
 we refer to a well tamed horse 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.430
 we are talking about an animal capable of understanding 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.430
 orders that subtly i 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.270
 imparts the knight to whom 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 responds with the corresponding movements 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.300
 different rhythms and considerable variations 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.270
 of energy a horse could have 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.030
 even participated in having won 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.410
 great competitions but we still have to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 be careful not a well tamed horse 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.440
 needs a powerful impulse of the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.600
 leg to gallop these 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.670
 animals advance with a light one 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.340
 calf pressure 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.100
 the inexperienced rider could do 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.520
 strength on the side of the horse because 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.120
 loses balance and fear of falling 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.750
 that way he tries to avoid it if the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.610
 horse and well trained can 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.310
 interpret this pressure as one 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.760
 stimulus to go faster 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 and the reaction to the stimulus will therefore be 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.420
 opposite to that desired by the rider 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.430
 a horse curves slightly 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.469
 he feels a slight pressure from the reins 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.120
 on the neck 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.359
 if the rider shows him the direction 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.370
 of the time abruptly and with both 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.379
 the reins in one hand 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.379
 the horse feels that the reed in the outside 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.280
 leans on the neck while the inside 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.620
 stays in the air without going down this 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.439
 conduction form can cause two 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.540
 possible reactions 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.819
 the first is a violent turn on the side 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.859
 internal which could in turn a 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.760
 determine the fall of the rider 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.760
 inexperienced 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.290
 the second possible reaction is due 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.109
 to the fact that the horse feels that the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.900
 external rein leans on the neck 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.620
 without keeping the curve with that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.620
 then will move the head towards 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.120
 the outside and generates in the opposite direction 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.150
 compared to the will of the rider 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.290
 certainly thinking of a mistake of the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.940
 horse 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 the rider will increase the pressure 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.280
 on the reins to force him to change 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.409
 direction 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.780
 a new knight does not realize 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.650
 who is he to make mistakes and have to 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.959
 correct the indication when yes 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.069
 increases the pressure in a well horse 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.150
 tamed to which moreover it was 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.459
 taught the surge exercise can 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.799
 happen that in the moment in which center 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.209
 action of the reins on his neck e 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.709
 On the mouth 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.709
 you think you have to commit yourself 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.810
 it is not necessary to explain fright 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.810
 that this could give to the poor 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.060
 knight who gets a reaction like that 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.700
 different from what one would be 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.980
 waited 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.500
 a well tamed horse does not need 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.519
 be pulled forcefully from the mouth to 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.590
 curb the inexperienced rider is not 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.650
 able to regulate the strength of the hands 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.620
 to give indications in general i 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:33.320
 beginners stick to the reins e 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.320
 they give sharp and dry tears 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.030
 if a horse is properly trained 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.240
 he feels that a lot is being applied to him 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.910
 force on the mouth raises the head e 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.580
 even shakes her to get rid of 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.790
 off this exaggerated pressure on 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.800
 gums 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.440
 this reaction could be 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.870
 dangerous for the rider because 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.860
 could get a shot in the face either 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.710
 fall due to braking when 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.620
 a rider begins to mount must 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.350
 use the tame horses not finely 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.020
 trained by a gentle horse there 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.550
 expects to be docere in departures at 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.630
 trotting at a gallop but must not 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.760
 be excessively sensitive 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.389
 in these conditions the rider can 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.330
 manage cadences without surprises too 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.960
 if due to lack of sensitivity 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:41.910
 transitions may not be seen in 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.030
 clear and clear way it is preferable that 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.580
 the gentle horse is prepared to 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:51.419
 bear the incorrect indications of the 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.210
 his new rider for this will have to 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.000
 having a slightly hard mouth i 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.199
 very sensitive horses cannot stand 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.160
 driving errors a horse 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.289
 meek must be calm in the movements 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.560
 allowing his rider to 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.300
 to accompany someone without problems 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.449
 might think that it is 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.740
 laziness or slowness when it is instead one 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.900
 virtue with a gentle horse must 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.470
 insist with the leg to do it 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.389
 move forward and probably won't brake with 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:33.560
 precision but not so important 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:36.740
 although these horses are not perfect 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.810
 they will offer the knight the first weapons 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.730
 the affection and security he has 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.740
 need 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.139
 the important thing is to have fun without 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.820
 accidents 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.820
 there will be time to compete
