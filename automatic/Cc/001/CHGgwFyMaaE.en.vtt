00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.669
 A good book accompanies you many times 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.669
 it saves you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.129
 willing to be placed must be 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.710
 safe walk in trouble just setting 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.329
 around I think that literature serves to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.940
 many other things it serves so that 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.129
 let's know better our language so that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.979
 know say all the riches 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.149
 possibilities that our language has 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.370
 development us a critical spirit 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.219
 Reading is a form of happiness 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.160
 and if they do not read they are missing something 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.600
 very important and I believe that the end 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.359
 lesson place where can you find 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.980
 many reasons for happiness in 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.140
 Guadalajara would be from one of the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.210
 main cultural moments in the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.360
 broader meaning of the word and in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.440
 where the writers stay with their 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.210
 readers and there are few fairs the size to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.369
 although they have a turnover 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.800
 maybe older have a cultural festival 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.110
 and a capacity of that size but that 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.260
 always know what others do 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.260

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.439
 a very important fair for
