00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
up again and fold each into that crease

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.040 
up again and fold each into that crease
I<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:25.000> think<00:01:25.060> standing<00:01:25.330> up<00:01:25.810> in<00:01:25.960> these

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
I don't think standing up in these

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.930 
I don't think standing up in these
videos<00:01:26.259> is<00:01:26.410> very<00:01:26.770> good<00:01:26.950> i<00:01:27.160> just<00:01:27.490> started

standing up so i'm not going to keep
doing<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.369> though<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.759> then<00:01:31.000> fold<00:01:31.300> each

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
doing that though and then fold each

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:46.209 
doing that though and then fold each
corner<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.259> middle

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.919

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
then you're going to take each edge like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
then you're going to take each edge like
that<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.500> Bend<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> mail<00:01:57.020> make<00:01:58.020> sure

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that and Bend that to the mail make sure

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.760 
that and Bend that to the mail make sure
when<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> overlaps<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.869> yes<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.439> supposed<00:02:01.709> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
when it overlaps it yes it's supposed to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.919 
when it overlaps it yes it's supposed to
overlap<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> overlaps<00:02:03.209> on<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.659> same

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
overlap that it overlaps on the same

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.660 
overlap that it overlaps on the same
each<00:02:04.170> side<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.859> if<00:02:04.979> you're<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> overlap

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
each side so if you're going to overlap

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
each side so if you're going to overlap
this<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.209> on<00:02:06.359> to<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.719> window<00:02:07.049> make<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this one on to that window make on this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.970 
this one on to that window make on this
side<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.239> overlap<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:11.629> yeah

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
side this one overlap on this one yeah

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:27.589 
side this one overlap on this one yeah
okay<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:25.730> sure<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.209> can<00:02:27.329> be<00:02:27.480> kind

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
okay so just do that sure it can be kind

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.259 
okay so just do that sure it can be kind
of<00:02:27.720> confusing<00:02:28.129> overlapping<00:02:29.129> them<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.579> then

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
of confusing overlapping them and then

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:40.240 
of confusing overlapping them and then
fold<00:02:30.750> these<00:02:31.590> parts<00:02:33.200> into<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> middle<00:02:34.500> again

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.449 

hmm<00:02:41.250> okay<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.109> then<00:02:43.620> you've<00:02:43.739> got<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.190> I'm

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
hmm okay so then you've got this I'm

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.780 
hmm okay so then you've got this I'm
