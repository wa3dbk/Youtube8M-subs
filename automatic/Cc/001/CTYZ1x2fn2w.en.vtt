00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.539
 today I will explain how to get the 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.050
 Neodymium magnet inside a 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:10.050
 hard disk 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.020
 for this we need a hard drive 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.780
 that some hard disk already given does not work 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.070
 low 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.070
 like these that I have here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.730
 the hard drives are closed by a 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.480
 series of screws that are usually 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.870
 of tor type that are these screws that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.579
 they have a star shape 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.520
 then we will need a screwdriver 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.520
 or a torque wrench 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.910
 we look for the right size 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.910
 and we are removing the screws 1 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.940
 just to see another screw that is here 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.940
 hidden under the label 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.119
 and they do so to protect the guarantee 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:14.939
 that is, in case someone came up with the idea 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 try to open it because it is already marked 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 and now it is handy but with a small 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.100
 screwdriver we pry 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.100
 and we can remove the lid 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 and here we have the hard drive open 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.710
 this is the disk those are the heads 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710
 readers 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.799
 and the magnet is here below 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.210
 therefore the first thing that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.210
 we will need is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.930
 Remove this screw also with a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.930
 thorax key 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.209
 it is a neodymium magnet is a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.150
 magnet small but very powerful therefore 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.349
 you have to take into account a series of 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.349
 of precautions 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.040
 and here below we have another 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.100
 Now with a flat screwdriver 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.030
 let's remove this shaft screw 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.030
 of the head 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 If you look here you carry a coil is 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.730
 this coil when electricity circulates 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.760
 for her to be in the presence of the field 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.180
 magnetic of these two magnets 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.250
 generates a force 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.739
 so that controlling the current 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.050
 that reaches the coil we can control 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.870
 the movement 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.849
 of the reading heads 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.849
 again with the torch key 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.060
 we remove 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.290
 the two screws 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.160
 and we already have the other magnet 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.980
 the magnet is just the little horseshoe that 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.110
 is stuck in the metal frame 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.180
 according to what type of hard drive or what 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.250
 then maybe we can have the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.720
 lucky to find us magnets more 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.720
 thick and stronger like this 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.540
 this is not bad either 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.430
 this is a magnet that has taken off 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.530
 of the iron that holds it 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.270
 to release a magnet from the plate where 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.090
 is attached 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.669
 we should not do it with a screwdriver 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.699
 leveraging since they are very magnets 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.069
 fragile and it would be pretty easy to be 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.370
 break to release what 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.520
 we need is to fold this plate according to 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.759
 the thickness will be easier or harder to 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.849
 hand of course we will not be able to 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.129
 well at least I can not 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.550
 then we will use either two 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.939
 pliers or a vise and 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.939
 a plier 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.850
 we hold the plate 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.850
 a pliers at each end 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.590
 and now all flat plate 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.210
 already looms 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.940
 the magnet now we could carefully 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.840
 try it but we can not load it there 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.190
 to be very careful if you resist not 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.260
 you have to do force you do not have to force it 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.409
 you have to try to continue doubling the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.939
 license plate 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.939
 we already have a separate magnet 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.310
 we must remember a series of 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.620
 precautions when working with 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.000
 neodymium magnets never leave them at 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.220
 reach of children who can 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.800
 work not bring them closer to people who 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.900
 have pacemakers if two are released 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.000
 magnets to attract with so much force 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.850
 they can break and the pieces can 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.490
 jump into the eyes danger of pinching or 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.920
 crushing according to the size of the magnet and 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.110
 as always we see each other on Mondays 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.010
 life science 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.010
 i 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.789
 do not
