oh I'll tell you in a second when I
anyway<00:00:13.800> that's<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> apparatus<00:00:14.550> uh<00:00:17.029> it's<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
anyway that's the apparatus uh it's a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.560 
anyway that's the apparatus uh it's a
whole<00:00:18.240> bunch<00:00:18.450> of<00:00:18.540> wires<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.080> else<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
whole bunch of wires what else is it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
whole bunch of wires what else is it
there's<00:00:21.570> no<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.320> metal<00:00:22.590> wires<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.520> positive

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
there's no the metal wires the positive

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640 
there's no the metal wires the positive
is<00:00:24.240> attached<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> double<00:00:25.200> wire<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is attached to the double wire and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
is attached to the double wire and
there's<00:00:25.770> two<00:00:25.950> there's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> double<00:00:26.550> wire<00:00:26.669> in<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
there's two there's a double wire in a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.370 
there's two there's a double wire in a
single<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.300> uh-huh

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
single one uh-huh

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.279 
single one uh-huh
one<00:00:28.890> being<00:00:29.099> positive<00:00:29.520> one<00:00:29.669> being

this<00:00:30.859> tube<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.339> runs<00:00:31.400> down<00:00:31.730> here<00:00:31.960> I'm<00:00:32.960> not

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
this tube that runs down here I'm not

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.799 
this tube that runs down here I'm not
entirely<00:00:33.800> sure<00:00:33.980> why<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.149> plans<00:00:35.420> call<00:00:35.750> for

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
entirely sure why but the plans call for

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.500 
entirely sure why but the plans call for
some<00:00:36.350> air<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:37.129> be<00:00:37.219> let<00:00:37.489> into<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.000> mixture<00:00:38.270> as

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
some air to be let into the mixture as

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.479 
some air to be let into the mixture as
well<00:00:38.690> at<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:38.989> bottom<00:00:39.260> Center<00:00:39.500> oxygen<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:40.430> you

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
well at the bottom Center oxygen so you

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.939 
well at the bottom Center oxygen so you
let<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.180> few<00:00:41.510> bubbles<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.500> has<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.769> little

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
let a few bubbles this has a little

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.920 
let a few bubbles this has a little
valve<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.550> here<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.390> sucks<00:00:44.660> in<00:00:44.839> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
valve on it here and it sucks in the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.280 
valve on it here and it sucks in the
tiny<00:00:45.170> bit<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.440> air<00:00:45.589> into<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.219> bottom<00:00:47.050> well<00:00:48.050> it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
tiny bit of air into the bottom well it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.840 
tiny bit of air into the bottom well it
would<00:00:48.440> be<00:00:48.589> worth<00:00:48.739> miss<00:00:48.980> myth-busting<00:00:49.729> now

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
would be worth miss myth-busting now

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.829 
would be worth miss myth-busting now
wouldn't<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.620> or<00:00:51.620> proving<00:00:52.390> screaming<00:00:53.390> miss

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
wouldn't it or proving screaming miss

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.540 
wouldn't it or proving screaming miss
proving<00:00:55.420> all<00:00:56.420> right<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:56.809> that's<00:00:56.930> fresh<00:00:57.260> water

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
proving all right so that's fresh water

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.670 
proving all right so that's fresh water
which<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.699> apparently<00:00:59.180> not<00:00:59.629> so<00:00:59.960> good<00:01:00.440> for<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
which is apparently not so good for the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.490 
which is apparently not so good for the
battery<00:01:00.949> maybe<00:01:01.399> or<00:01:01.790> not<00:01:02.089> as<00:01:02.269> good<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:03.019> conductor

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
battery maybe or not as good a conductor

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.679 
battery maybe or not as good a conductor
that<00:01:03.710> is<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:04.339> not<00:01:04.610> fresh<00:01:05.089> water<00:01:05.420> it's

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
that is it's not fresh water it's

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.810 
that is it's not fresh water it's
distilled<00:01:06.470> water<00:01:06.680> mixed<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:07.220> baking<00:01:07.640> soda

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
distilled water mixed with baking soda

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.359 
distilled water mixed with baking soda
oh<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.110> there's<00:01:09.290> already<00:01:09.470> baking<00:01:09.979> soda<00:01:10.189> in<00:01:10.340> it

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
oh so there's already baking soda in it

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.920 
oh so there's already baking soda in it
okay<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.820> makes<00:01:11.000> sense<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.659> have

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
okay that makes sense this is I have

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.630 
okay that makes sense this is I have
this<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:12.259> my<00:01:12.290> car<00:01:12.590> because<00:01:12.710> if<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.250> need<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.490> fill

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
this in my car because if I need to fill

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.530 
this in my car because if I need to fill
it<00:01:13.729> up<00:01:13.790> what<00:01:13.970> I'm<00:01:14.090> out

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
it up what I'm out

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.950 
it up what I'm out
I<00:01:14.570> can't<00:01:16.000> it's<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.090> close-up<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.780> you'll

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
I can't it's a close-up of this you'll

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.260 
I can't it's a close-up of this you'll
see<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> bubbles<00:01:18.560> form<00:01:18.890> on<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.790> wires<00:01:20.000> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
see the bubbles form on the wires and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.210 
see the bubbles form on the wires and
then<00:01:20.360> start<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.720> travel<00:01:20.930> like<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.890> bubbles

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
then start to travel like the bubbles

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.679 
then start to travel like the bubbles
the<00:01:22.460> hydrogen<00:01:22.880> bubbles<00:01:23.150> will<00:01:23.240> form<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
the hydrogen bubbles will form on the

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.990 
the hydrogen bubbles will form on the
single<00:01:23.990> ones<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.890> oxygen<00:01:25.340> bubbles<00:01:25.640> form<00:01:25.850> on

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
single ones the oxygen bubbles form on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.090 
single ones the oxygen bubbles form on
the<00:01:26.090> double<00:01:26.329> one<00:01:26.450> huh<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.439> that's<00:01:27.890> why<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
the double one huh and that's why the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.469 
the double one huh and that's why the
double<00:01:28.490> one<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.759> rusting<00:01:29.149> because<00:01:29.329> it

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
double one is rusting because it

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.910 
double one is rusting because it
attracts<00:01:30.079> me<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.710> oxygen<00:01:31.399> which

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.580 

oxygen<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.010> why<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.190> get<00:01:35.400> old<00:01:35.580> man<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:37.470> also

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
oxygen is why you get old man it's also

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430 
oxygen is why you get old man it's also
why<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.830> live

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.710 

double-edged<00:01:42.440> sword<00:01:42.710> s<00:01:42.830> yes<00:01:43.310> yeah<00:01:44.350> wait

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.860 

yo

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.740 

that<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.830> pretty<00:01:59.190> cool<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.970> gas<00:02:00.120> forming<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that is pretty cool the gas forming and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
that is pretty cool the gas forming and
the<00:02:00.810> hydrogen<00:02:01.110> gases<00:02:01.410> forming<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.160> on<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the hydrogen gases forming on the on the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
the hydrogen gases forming on the on the
sink<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.470> single<00:02:04.740> wires<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.310> oxygen

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
sink off the single wires and the oxygen

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
sink off the single wires and the oxygen
is<00:02:05.820> forming<00:02:06.180> off<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.540> double<00:02:06.840> line<00:02:06.990> okay<00:02:07.740> yeah

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is forming off the double line okay yeah

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.940 
is forming off the double line okay yeah
and<00:02:08.070> that's<00:02:08.160> why<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.520> look<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:09.390> rested<00:02:10.350> Hey

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and that's why they look more rested Hey

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.890 
and that's why they look more rested Hey
yeah<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.340> start<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> hooked<00:02:12.720> up

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
yeah now start it up this is hooked up

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.270 
yeah now start it up this is hooked up
to<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> engine<00:02:13.290> through<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.650> vacuum<00:02:14.100> hoses

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
to the engine through the vacuum hoses
