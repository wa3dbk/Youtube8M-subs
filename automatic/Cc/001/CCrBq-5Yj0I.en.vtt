00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
inside the law but I think you can like

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.180 
inside the law but I think you can like
if<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.780> hit<00:02:57.990> if<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.680> hit<00:02:58.800> by<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> lava

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
if you hit if you get hit by the lava

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.470 
if you hit if you get hit by the lava
and<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.490> get<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.330> die<00:03:00.450> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and you get out of it and then you die I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.210 
and you get out of it and then you die I
think<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.870> works<00:03:01.050> fine<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.410> i<00:03:01.860> found<00:03:02.070> that

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
think that works fine but i found that

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.550 
think that works fine but i found that
fireworks<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> best<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.480> obviously<00:03:03.960> mobs

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
