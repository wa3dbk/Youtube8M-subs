00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
pretty sure this is a spruce tree here

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.250 
pretty sure this is a spruce tree here
and<00:02:46.610> yep<00:02:47.510> pretty<00:02:47.989> much

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and yep pretty much

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.340 
and yep pretty much
hide<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> leaves<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.880> spruces<00:02:50.420> does<00:02:51.140> work

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
hide in the leaves of spruces does work

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.560 
hide in the leaves of spruces does work
obviously<00:02:51.590> very<00:02:52.220> good<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:52.880> bases<00:02:53.390> maybe

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
obviously very good for like bases maybe

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.760 
obviously very good for like bases maybe
high<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.050> trees<00:02:54.260> anything<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:54.739> that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
moving through the trees of spruce trees

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.360 
moving through the trees of spruce trees
because<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.510> get<00:02:56.630> those<00:02:56.750> big<00:02:56.959> forests<00:02:57.500> very

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
