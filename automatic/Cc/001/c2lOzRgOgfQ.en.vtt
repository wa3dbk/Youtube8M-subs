 It costs 350 30,000 yen when I try to calculate the horsepower unit price 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:41.430
 For this car with a maximum output of 150 horsepower, the price per hp is 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:45.120
 In the 10,000 yen into contact with the reverse yen 235 303 you can get a 0.42 field force 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.920
 The price per torque 1 kgm after the next 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:57.950
