mention and we're going to be charging a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.789 
mention and we're going to be charging a
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> try<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> charge<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.210> ipad<00:01:03.719> using<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
going to try to charge a ipad using the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.030 
going to try to charge a ipad using the
eye<00:01:05.010> epc<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.960> i'll<00:01:07.049> plug<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> I've

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
eye epc so i'll plug it in and I've

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
eye epc so i'll plug it in and I've
actually<00:01:08.220> hooked<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> power<00:01:09.260> cable<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
actually hooked up the power cable to a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
actually hooked up the power cable to a
power<00:01:11.010> meter<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.270> show<00:01:12.450> us<00:01:12.570> how

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
power meter so this will show us how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
power meter so this will show us how
many<00:01:12.780> amps<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.799> delivered<00:01:14.220> through

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
many amps is actually delivered through

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.350 
many amps is actually delivered through
the<00:01:14.490> USB<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.430> it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the USB so as we can see here it's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
the USB so as we can see here it's
delivering<00:01:19.159> 0.47<00:01:20.159> amps<00:01:22.850> not<00:01:23.850> charging<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.250> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
delivering 0.47 amps not charging so I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
delivering 0.47 amps not charging so I
guess<00:01:26.610> quickly<00:01:26.970> i'll<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.540> show<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.140> demo

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
guess quickly i'll just show you a demo

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.590 
guess quickly i'll just show you a demo
of<00:01:28.560> us<00:01:29.070> charging<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> show<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
of us charging just to show that we can

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
of us charging just to show that we can
unplug<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> gigabyte<00:01:36.619> p55<00:01:37.619> aud<00:01:38.189> 5

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
unplug it this is a gigabyte p55 aud 5

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.600 
unplug it this is a gigabyte p55 aud 5
port<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> USB<00:01:40.920> ports<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.430> work

even though USB 3 ports but to the blue

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700 
even though USB 3 ports but to the blue
ones<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> blue<00:01:45.930> ones<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
ones right which are the blue ones but

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.810 
ones right which are the blue ones but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
since this device is only a USB 2 we'll

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.280 
since this device is only a USB 2 we'll
just<00:01:51.000> plug<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> into<00:01:51.509> USB<00:01:51.840> 2<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> said

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
just plug it into USB 2 so as I said

let me show you the power cord and we'll

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080 
let me show you the power cord and we'll
show<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:19.740> much<00:02:19.980> power<00:02:20.580> you're

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
show you just how much power you're

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.390 
show you just how much power you're
actually<00:02:21.270> able<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.080> get<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.740> using<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually able to get up and using the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.680 
actually able to get up and using the
power<00:02:24.030> adapter<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.750> apple<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.420> hook<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.540> up<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
power adapter for apple so hook it up to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.600 
power adapter for apple so hook it up to
our<00:02:27.810> power<00:02:28.140> meter<00:02:28.350> again<00:02:28.680> plug<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:30.410> as<00:02:31.610> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
our power meter again plug it in as you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.200 
our power meter again plug it in as you
hear<00:02:32.820> it's<00:02:32.970> charging<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.320> at<00:02:34.700> 1.57<00:02:35.700> amps

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
hear it's charging so it's at 1.57 amps

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
hear it's charging so it's at 1.57 amps
so<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.440> little<00:02:37.560> bit<00:02:37.770> higher<00:02:37.950> than

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980
