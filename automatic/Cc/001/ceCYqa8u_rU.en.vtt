00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
roasting Brussels sprouts so I washed my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
roasting Brussels sprouts so I washed my
Brussels<00:00:26.670> sprouts<00:00:26.700> under<00:00:27.180> some<00:00:27.360> cold<00:00:27.690> water

Brussels sprouts under some cold water

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
Brussels sprouts under some cold water
gave<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.350> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.620> rinse<00:00:28.860> then<00:00:29.430> I<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.700> sure

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
gave them a good rinse then I was sure

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.119 
gave them a good rinse then I was sure
to<00:00:30.060> dry<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.320> well<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.770> you<00:00:31.860> don't

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
to dry them off really well if you don't

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.680 
to dry them off really well if you don't
dry<00:00:32.460> them<00:00:32.730> they're<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.449> end<00:00:33.600> up

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
dry them they're going to end up

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.509 
dry them they're going to end up
steaming<00:00:34.230> instead<00:00:34.499> of<00:00:34.589> roasting<00:00:35.039> so<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> have

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
steaming instead of roasting so you have

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.549 
steaming instead of roasting so you have
to<00:00:35.640> make<00:00:35.789> sure<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.149> them<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.839> dry
