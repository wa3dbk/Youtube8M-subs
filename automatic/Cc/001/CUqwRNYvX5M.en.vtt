that<00:03:01.440> way<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.650> know<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> pull

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
that way you know it's going to pull

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.930 
that way you know it's going to pull
free<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> plug<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:04.640> you'll<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.670> you've

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
normal pressure take a small short test

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.789 
normal pressure take a small short test
ride<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.609> make<00:03:35.209> sure<00:03:35.239> it's<00:03:35.629> good<00:03:35.689> most<00:03:36.590> of

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
ride on it make sure it's good most of

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.410 
ride on it make sure it's good most of
the<00:03:36.890> times<00:03:37.129> I'll<00:03:37.340> hold<00:03:37.519> just<00:03:37.790> fine<00:03:37.969> a<00:03:38.209> lot<00:03:38.390> of

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the times I'll hold just fine a lot of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.539 
the times I'll hold just fine a lot of
people<00:03:38.510> like<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> take<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.349> tire<00:03:39.530> off<00:03:39.560> do<00:03:40.430> an

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
people like to take the tire off do an

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.300 
people like to take the tire off do an
internal<00:03:40.879> plug<00:03:41.409> that's<00:03:42.409> a<00:03:42.500> good<00:03:42.620> idea<00:03:42.680> it's

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
internal plug that's a good idea it's

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.339 
internal plug that's a good idea it's
probably<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.760> better<00:03:43.909> idea<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.109> road

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
probably a better idea out on the road

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.299 
probably a better idea out on the road
this<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.590> fine<00:03:46.299> thanks
