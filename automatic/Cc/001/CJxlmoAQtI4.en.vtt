big<00:01:49.000> star<00:01:49.240> Wars<00:01:49.270> fan<00:01:49.479> but<00:01:49.960> Lucas<00:01:50.290> managed<00:01:50.560> to

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
big star Wars fan but Lucas managed to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.800 
big star Wars fan but Lucas managed to
completely<00:01:51.130> ruin<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:51.880> me<00:01:52.149> yeah<00:01:52.450> this

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
completely ruin that for me yeah this

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.749 
completely ruin that for me yeah this
remains<00:01:53.259> true<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.920> know<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.340> well<00:01:54.580> and

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
remains true you know so well and

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.210 
remains true you know so well and
arguably<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.210> would<00:01:55.299> be<00:01:55.420> difficult<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:56.220> to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
arguably it would be difficult to to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.880 
arguably it would be difficult to to
rebuild<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:58.210> Death<00:01:58.420> Star<00:01:58.590> alright<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.710> there's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
rebuild a Death Star alright so there's

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.310 
rebuild a Death Star alright so there's
like<00:02:00.009> what<00:02:00.490> 10<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.940> 20<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.450> these<00:02:01.600> yeah<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.140> mean

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
like what 10 to 20 of these yeah I mean

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.810 
like what 10 to 20 of these yeah I mean
there's<00:02:02.740> more<00:02:02.860> all<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> time<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.610> makes

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
there's more all the time what makes

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.580 
there's more all the time what makes
them<00:02:03.970> different<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.479> comes<00:02:04.750> down<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.930> accuracy

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
them different it comes down to accuracy

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.870 
them different it comes down to accuracy
that's<00:02:05.770> what<00:02:05.950> you're<00:02:06.070> looking<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
that's what you're looking for the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
that's what you're looking for the
problem<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.539> is<00:02:07.899> just<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.470> first

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
problem with this is just in the first

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.690 
problem with this is just in the first
movie<00:02:08.920> alone<00:02:09.100> there<00:02:09.310> were<00:02:09.399> three<00:02:09.580> different

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
movie alone there were three different

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
movie alone there were three different
cars<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.989> becomes<00:02:11.110> very<00:02:11.500> difficult<00:02:11.739> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
cars it's it becomes very difficult to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.559 
cars it's it becomes very difficult to
really<00:02:12.280> decide<00:02:12.610> which<00:02:12.849> part<00:02:13.150> was<00:02:13.300> right

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
really decide which part was right

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.940 
really decide which part was right
because<00:02:13.870> every<00:02:14.140> car<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.500> slightly<00:02:14.709> different

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
because every car was slightly different

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.890 
because every car was slightly different
let's<00:02:15.459> go<00:02:15.550> ahead<00:02:15.610> get<00:02:15.819> inside<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.510> check<00:02:16.720> out

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
let's go ahead get inside and check out

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.539 
let's go ahead get inside and check out
what's<00:02:17.110> going<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.380> there<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.940> okay

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
what's going on there right okay

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.979 
what's going on there right okay
so<00:02:24.549> obviously<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> first<00:02:25.299> thing<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
so obviously the first thing I see in

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.960 
so obviously the first thing I see in
here<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.200> Einstein<00:02:26.769> actually<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.790> is

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
here is Einstein actually and this is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
here is Einstein actually and this is
the<00:02:28.120> screen<00:02:28.420> accurate<00:02:28.600> stopwatch<00:02:29.290> got<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.860> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the screen accurate stopwatch got up so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.479 
the screen accurate stopwatch got up so
you<00:02:30.280> turned<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> time<00:02:31.060> circuit<00:02:31.420> switch<00:02:31.690> here

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
you turned the time circuit switch here

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.490 
you turned the time circuit switch here
which<00:02:33.489> powers<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> time<00:02:34.269> circuits<00:02:34.720> as

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
which powers on the time circuits as

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500 
which powers on the time circuits as
well<00:02:35.799> as<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.100> plutonium<00:02:36.880> chamber<00:02:37.209> indicator

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
well as the plutonium chamber indicator

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
well as the plutonium chamber indicator
there<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.610> like<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.910> movie<00:02:41.400> there

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
there and just like in the movie there

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.890 
there and just like in the movie there
you<00:02:42.489> go<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:43.239> have<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.690> flux

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
you go you have to have the flux

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.780 
you go you have to have the flux
capacitor<00:02:44.049> yes<00:02:44.650> what's<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.489> on<00:02:45.579> with<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
capacitor yes what's going on with the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.819 
capacitor yes what's going on with the
detailing<00:02:46.239> here<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.900> had<00:02:47.109> gary<00:02:47.350> build<00:02:47.560> me<00:02:47.709> this

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
detailing here I had gary build me this

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.690 
detailing here I had gary build me this
car<00:02:48.070> as<00:02:48.250> his<00:02:48.400> intention<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.940> detail<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.690> just

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
car as his intention to detail is just

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.160 
car as his intention to detail is just
insane<00:02:51.700> there's<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.209> shot<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> making<00:02:53.049> of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
insane there's a shot in the making of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.569 
insane there's a shot in the making of
where<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.530> actually<00:02:53.829> read<00:02:54.100> what<00:02:54.130> these

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
where you can actually read what these

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.370 
where you can actually read what these
label<00:02:54.940> said<00:02:55.209> okay<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:55.840> pretty<00:02:55.870> sure<00:02:56.260> he

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
label said okay and I'm pretty sure he

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.900 
label said okay and I'm pretty sure he
printed<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.829> out<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.220> traced<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.790> in

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
printed that out and traced it in

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.539 
printed that out and traced it in
anyways<00:02:58.720> Kyle<00:02:59.320> put<00:02:59.530> some<00:02:59.650> plutonium<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.340> the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
anyways Kyle put some plutonium in the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.360 
anyways Kyle put some plutonium in the
car<00:03:00.730> could<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.030> actually<00:03:01.410> yeah<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:03.040> guess<00:03:03.190> it's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
car could I actually yeah I guess it's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.830 
car could I actually yeah I guess it's
enough<00:03:03.790> yeah<00:03:04.030> we<00:03:04.150> got<00:03:04.269> some<00:03:04.450> over<00:03:04.570> here<00:03:04.690> once

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
enough yeah we got some over here once

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:20.839 
enough yeah we got some over here once
you<00:03:04.930> come<00:03:05.049> around<00:03:05.140> we'll<00:03:05.440> get<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.010> out

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.819 

we<00:03:21.849> go<00:03:21.970> no<00:03:22.569> more<00:03:22.599> threat<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.049> radiation<00:03:23.200> no

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
we go no more threat of radiation no

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.399 
we go no more threat of radiation no
we're<00:03:24.250> good<00:03:24.400> alright<00:03:24.840> alright<00:03:25.840> now<00:03:26.019> now<00:03:26.230> that

do<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.019> though<00:03:44.859> these<00:03:45.010> are<00:03:45.159> fabricated

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
do you get though these are fabricated

made to be this backhoe yeah this is
welded<00:03:48.459> together<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:49.030> lot<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.390> aircraft

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810

parts you basically can't get anymore

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.660 
parts you basically can't get anymore
because<00:03:52.150> since<00:03:52.510> 9/11<00:03:53.280> they<00:03:54.280> don't<00:03:54.430> want<00:03:54.549> any

interesting even stuff that would just
be<00:03:58.810> junk<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:01.810> right<00:04:01.989> now<00:04:02.170> we're<00:04:02.349> in<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.620> we're

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
be junk all right now we're in if we're

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:03.990 
be junk all right now we're in if we're
gonna<00:04:02.920> take<00:04:03.129> it<00:04:03.220> on<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.370> interstate<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.849> see

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
gonna take it on the interstate and see

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.670 
gonna take it on the interstate and see
if<00:04:04.060> we<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.209> get<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.359> up<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.540> 88<00:04:05.019> miles<00:04:05.260> an<00:04:05.530> hour

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
if we can get it up to 88 miles an hour

if we can get it up to 88 miles an hour
and<00:04:05.950> make<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.129> ripple<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.790> space-time

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
and make a ripple in the space-time

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.460 
and make a ripple in the space-time
continuum<00:04:07.329> that's<00:04:08.230> good

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470
