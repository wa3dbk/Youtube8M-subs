00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello in this video we're going to talk about 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.319
 all the characteristics and rumors of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.570
 nexus 5 the phone created by the axis in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.090
 collaboration of the google software that 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.190
 comes to happen to the current nexus 4 that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.279
 so many successes has given and that was also 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 manufactured by lg a year ago so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.270
 let's see in this video all the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.369
 characteristics and all the rumors like that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 as the technical specifications that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.650
 today there was October 7, 2013 they have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 filtered and it seems that they will be 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 really what is going to be presented in the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
 phone within a week so 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 let's start with the screen the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 screen would increase in size if in this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.570
 model the nexus 4 has a screen 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 47 inches the screen will increase 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.670
 up to 497 that is practically five 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.149
 inches conserving technology 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 current 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.850
 ips with a tfc panel but improving the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.750
 resolution until you reach full hd is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 say 1920 x 1080 pixels as it presents 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.879
 most screens of this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.040
 generation of the year 2013 the processor 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.600
 It would also be renewed until incorporated 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 a qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 800 which is specifically the model ms 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 89 74 four-core grade 400 to one 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 frequency of 2 to 4 gigahertz from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 then a true beast and without a doubt 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 a big update regarding the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.810
 current processor that is the snapdragon 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.570
 s4 and also ram memory that does 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.789
 I would keep would have 2 gigs coming 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 to be a more than decent amount for 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.649
 move most applications 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 Current versions of storage 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.090
 this time they would change we would be talking 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.610
 of 16 gb in its model with minor 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 capacity and 32 gigs also obviously 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 without the ability to expand through 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.250
 microsd cards like ya have us 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.740
 accustomed google the camera will 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.479
 would retain the number of megapixels 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.789
 but a great innovation that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.030
 would incorporate would be the stabilizer 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.159
 optical that in addition to helping us reduce 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 the vibrations while we record video 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.569
 or we make photographs would also allow 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.760
 that the camera captures much greater light 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.010
 besides improving 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.930
 the nexus 4 because it would incorporate a 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.269
 optical glass that was one of the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.220
 major flaws of the chamber of 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.659
 nexus 4 and what it did that despite 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.700
 have a good amount of megapixels 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.610
 they did not look very well 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.170
 photographs in terms of front camera 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.930
 we would be talking about which would incorporate 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.579
 1.3 megapixels with the possibility of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.620
 record video at 720p the battery would be 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.900
 2300 milliamperes an amount more than 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.310
 decent though maybe he would stay a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.379
 little bit considering that the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.959
 processor and full hd resolution 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.959
 they consume a little more than normal and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.840
 lastly as wireless charging nfc and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.870
 possibility to connect to 4g lte networks 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.879
 as it already has available nexus 4 current 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.739
 but that would not be finished factory 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.500
 as it has been in the previous 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.780
 model as you are watching on screen 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.329
 the images are quite reliable 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.209
 has something that if we must highlight here 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.420
 regarding its appearance is that it has the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.579
 nexus logo in horizontal format something 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.340
 that many can give of what to think and 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.690
 that incorporates the tablet in nexus 7 of the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.900
 2013 version 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.420
 that also incorporates the same module 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.730
 camera that despite having a lens 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.800
 So big does not mean I'm going to have 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.680
 higher quality to the camera simply 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.300
 they have decided to do so 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.970
 simply by visual aspect besides 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.460
 this nexus 4 as well as any other 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.110
 Nexus device would be presented with a 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.330
 new android version concretely 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.180
 we are talking about android 4.4 kitkat 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.220
 that is already known by many and according to 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.070
 some rumors and according to donald in 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.170
 some filtering android 4.4 together 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.770
 to lexus 5 would be presented on 14 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.200
 October is to say today would a week and 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.720
 it is assumed that the device is going to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.060
 present as you see the leaks and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.240
 the rumors are already more than confirmed 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.730
 all that remains is for the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.430
 device but of course there's no 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.950
 to expect more news would come 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.500
 to be a renewal of the current nexus 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.570
 4 that is currently exhausted and 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.150
 what many of us hope is that 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.010
 nexus 5 follow the line of a price 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.620
 really economic like the one 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.150
 introduced the nexus 4 of its beginnings 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.490
 and that really hit the table 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.560
 all manufacturers obviously 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.660
 hope that this device does not cost 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.490
 three hundred euros because with the hardware 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.919
 it is impossible but also 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.860
 everyone said the same thing about the nexus 4 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.570
 and there you see the success that he had however 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.330
 it is expected that this model has a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210
 starting price of 400 euros or at least 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.699
 is what we all wish would be a price 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.979
 according to the google policies of 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.330
 sell more software than hardware is 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.970
 say sell a phone with some 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.760
 incredible specifications at a price 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.590
 more than decent and hopefully continue like this 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 the thing so good that's been all 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.100
