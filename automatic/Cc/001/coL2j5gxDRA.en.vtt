00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
every now and then any stuff like that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
every now and then any stuff like that
is<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.579> moving<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> new

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is going to be moving on to the new

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590 
is going to be moving on to the new
channel<00:00:40.050> huzi<00:00:40.530> IRL<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.030> real<00:00:42.329> life

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
channel huzi IRL which is in real life

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.470 
channel huzi IRL which is in real life
and<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.710> deem<00:00:44.010> stuff<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and that's what I deem stuff that you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
and that's what I deem stuff that you
know<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.840> camera<00:00:46.260> talking<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> guys

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
know I'm on camera talking to you guys

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.260 
know I'm on camera talking to you guys
so<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.550> probably<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so this is probably going to be one of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.639 
so this is probably going to be one of
the<00:00:48.390> last<00:00:48.539> times<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.469> just
