00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.570
 section as a study yes I have already studied 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.140
 immediately stone age 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.480
 bronze age all his research and already 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 almost studied all studies of iron 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 century as you can see and yet I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.630
 achieved the goal that set in 10 9 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 parts and this is the study of mathematics with a view 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 already build a master ballist as 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.670
 I did not want to make a stone thrower, I'm all 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.600
 put it on the ballista's my dream 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 fulfilled 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.580
 yes guys by the way I built the first 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 first workshop ballist and already started 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.759
 production of their first ballista yes 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.590
 guys i did this here i did it i 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.200
 very happy well these three are left 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 research bunny plow and team goal 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.100
 until already 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.110
 the early middle ages I don't know maybe 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 be i start right with the frame house 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.140
 most likely possible and high-rise plaque 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 carved high-rise see here for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 four hours I love this type 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:00.340
 residential buildings because i can't always 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:04.299
 be here well, not every hour I can shoot 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.030
 taxes on these houses so for four 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.160
 hours I think it is very good so 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.899
 but let's go back to the city and see 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.849
 how I arranged everything here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.440
 I have already spent three more extensions which 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.799
 actually helped me hold and here 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.549
 this here is the master ballist and 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.489
 jeweler before jeweler I built that 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.750
 will be engaged in the production of jewelry 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.680
 products for receptions and goods 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.860
 I raised a marble here and raised a stone 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.780
 raised paint at the expense of wine and wood 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 which I somehow were somehow 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.049
 priority 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.400
 but in strategic resource is not 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.579
 also raised ebony to 10 but i 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.239
 already spent it on research which 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.810
 need to expand and already raised fabric 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.519
 at the expense of wood 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.980
 the ambulance will probably like iron but 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:05.019
 I didn't need it for now but 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.850
 most likely will be and I watch 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.130
 destroyed the barracks 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.290
 these lancers because I wanted to accommodate 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
 all other buildings that are here now 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.099
 is the most important this already 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.400
 ballistic workshop and jeweler as well as 2 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.959
 triumphal arches which are in any way but 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.940
 help with extra happiness like 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.430
 this bonus performance up to 120 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.380
 percent I really like well 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.709
 our guild is developing very fast 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.989
 already the first level is reached, see 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.209
 here we are now now here 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.669
 of current bonuses this add 25 cache 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.359
 reputation go to the daily reputation 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:51.099
 guild bonus reserves as well as acceleration 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.930
 hiring that is required for hiring and 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.900
 unit treatment by 2 percent 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.419
 reduces the time already at the next level 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.919
 will be available reputation bonus add 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.959
 50k guild qi daily experience and 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:07.989
 add 300 reserve and so on 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.170
 probably already in the following levels 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.950
 at 3 4 or so on even acceleration 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.650
 research 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.890
 daily produces 0 strategic 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.620
 points well, probably more will be at least 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.300
 probably start with 1 and also decreases 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.050
 cost of construction of all buildings in 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.200
 coins and resources at zero percent well 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.320
 Okay, discounts are good, so we will 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.789
 go in this direction as in the treasury 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.840
 I have a treasury I added limestone 15 and brought 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.340
 jewelry up to 20 pieces soon i 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.180
 I think to assign to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.020
 very responsible posts very well here 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.229
 such here is the result of the guild also at me 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.460
 there are a lot of friends as well as friends 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:59.500
 Ok acquaintances who have already moved to 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:05.530
 the early middle ages and build and build 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.539
 of course I already have great buildings 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.360
 I help them so little but advance 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.490
 far less 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.159
 I need shalt deliver on bystrenkomu already 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.440
 early middle ages 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:21.550
 I want to quickly all these 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.690
 extensions under the recession to collect too 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.729
 As for the results of my my rankings 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.159
 Iron Age Towers and Bronze 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.969
 switched completely to the Iron Age so 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.770
 how here give much more of it more 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.900
 medals 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.930
 so I focused my attention here 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.520
 what is the exchange actually my neighbor to 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:49.090
 you need to get a neighbor in this game so 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.250
 I will work well , you see him 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.120
 exchange even attacked but was able to repel the attack 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.289
 I he just gave up there apparently did not want 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.529
 lose your people here about this garrison 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:05.289
 so I don't miss either i'll fight back 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:09.909
 that's why me as unless the barracks and 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:12.400
 2cos barely archery shooting ranges 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.740
 I'm not going to do anything yet 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.920
 barracks of warriors and and shooting range with 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.020
 slingers 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.260
 but soon being causing me to have 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.790
 do it because i need 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.180
 evolve to evolve need 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.490
