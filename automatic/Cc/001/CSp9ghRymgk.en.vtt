I think a lot about accents because it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.760 
I think a lot about accents because it
seems<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.640> least<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:48.090> sum<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.500> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
seems at least a sum of your is that I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.279 
seems at least a sum of your is that I
have<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.309> accent<00:00:50.820> I've<00:00:51.660> certainly<00:00:51.989> never

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
have an accent I've certainly never

noticed<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.980> I'd<00:00:53.190> sense<00:00:53.610> develop<00:00:54.090> because

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
noticed it I'd sense develop because

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
noticed it I'd sense develop because

rhetoric accents so pod has a hard-r
so<00:01:57.980> it<00:01:58.070> makes<00:01:58.280> sense<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.790> accents<00:01:59.330> in

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
so it makes sense that accents in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960 
so it makes sense that accents in
countries<00:01:59.840> colonized<00:02:00.320> later<00:02:00.680> like<00:02:01.190> Australia

countries colonized later like Australia

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.220 
countries colonized later like Australia
are<00:02:02.270> non-recurrent<00:02:03.230> like<00:02:03.980> this<00:02:04.310> one<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.230> the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
are non-recurrent like this one and the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.380 
are non-recurrent like this one and the
