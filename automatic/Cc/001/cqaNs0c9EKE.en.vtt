 Hi everyone, Saturday, June 23 , 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 2013 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.250
 I just saw on social networks a video 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.740
 posted by ricardo lopes concerning 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.440
 manifestation occurred yesterday near 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 atleticanos house in the arena of the bajada 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.150
 and just as he liked to do the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 my record of what happened in the north is 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.390
 seamstress to arrive first that there 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.980
 several years the organized fan 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 I 'm not ashamed of this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.410
 and for several years we fanatics 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 we carried the brazilian flag on our chest 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 showing that we love our country and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.790
 we also do not look at much 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.270
 there these manifestations are yes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.260
 vacancies all indications are great 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 nothing to take away, it's great that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 continue that defeating will be good for the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 our country 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 however I would like to report here some 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 facts 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.590
 first since the beginning of the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 protests in Brazil as it is known 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.540
 the organization's staff does not disclose 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.240
 Where do these walks go? 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.189
 goes the manifestation 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.549
 so if this manifestation of yesterday was 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.860
 peaceful and did not know where to go as 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.880
 that a day before a facebook network 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 called redd communication channel is already 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.470
 I knew she was going there downloaded 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.470
 I knew she was going home to the Mexicans. 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.729
 this manifestation really had the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.590
 peaceful intent 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.310
 I would like to report on 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.110
 Yesterday is a photographer that I 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.049
 I also found on facebook a profile 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 called photographs by what 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.250
 I could see a boy that several days ago 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 is taking several protest photos that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 It happens in Curitiba 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.890
 in one of the photos he took yesterday in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 low sand arena 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.320
 it reports the following in the description of the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.479
 photo hugs confrontation between supporters 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.119
 of the athletic paranense protesters 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.340
 I witnessed when the fans started. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.450
 was next strip of sand in formula 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.880
 1 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.039
 cordon when some demonstrators 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.140
 They began to play there was a stones save 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.950
 if you can and photographers for whom 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.010
 be able to close the accounts 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.319
 I say more yesterday, probably 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 he is a little bit away from the beginning of 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.830
 could be another means of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.330
 did not see this initial aggression 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.640
 It happened in the front 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.590
 It's okay, it 's not a crime. It's normal when a 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 if you want to walk in the middle in the middle 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.069
 And in the end 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.930
 The important thing is for you to participate if she 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.470
 There's a lot of it to 5 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 now where this manifestation really 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.760
 also had people of goods 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.190
 we can check this when these 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.560
 people who did not want violence with 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.760
 first sign of violence that occurred 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.090
 they ran down the side streets 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 meaning street iguaçu also took refuge 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.920
 lateral mirrors of the two cases at cgu 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.140
 getúlio vargas how can you see 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.819
 residents there opened their gates and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.459
 to welcome these people 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.180
 But even so, Ricardo 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.160
 probably saw that there was 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.310
 confrontation five then there were people 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.329
 that they wanted violence and were not 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.150
 Good 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.450
 so much so that our contention movement 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 lasted about an hour until 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.780
 ceased 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.260
 this insistence and go after the arena of 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.260
 downloaded 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.500
 I say more also yesterday when we 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.420
 we were there defending our house to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.160
 people did not kill anyone 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.510
 We did not rob anyone we did not. 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.910
 we chase nobody 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.859
 who followed what happened, saw that the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.310
 The athletic crowd was from the front 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.079
 from your stadium to the side entrance that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.099
 the stage has for the avenue getúlio 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.170

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.150

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.889
 simply this 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.130
