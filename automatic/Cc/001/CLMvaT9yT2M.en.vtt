00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
a brief crash course on sodium what it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
a brief crash course on sodium what it
does<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.880> help<00:00:18.119> us<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> how<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.020> can

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
does how it can help us and how it can

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
does how it can help us and how it can
hurt<00:00:19.500> us<00:00:19.710> let's<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> done<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.789> what

that's because both the sodium attracts
and<00:02:45.570> holds<00:02:45.840> water<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.290> your<00:02:46.440> blood<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.860> going

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and holds water so your blood is going

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.260

enough<00:03:18.750> sodium<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.320> first<00:03:19.890> thing<00:03:20.040> is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
enough sodium is first thing is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.880 
enough sodium is first thing is
dehydration<00:03:20.840> second<00:03:21.840> thing<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.110> cramping

third<00:03:23.459> thing<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> actually<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.750> won't<00:03:24.930> be

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
third thing is actually you won't be

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
blood to get in there you've got to have

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.610

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
muscle just say is flat and you really

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.730 
muscle just say is flat and you really
can't<00:03:42.690> feel<00:03:42.870> those<00:03:43.050> contractions<00:03:43.590> when

can't feel those contractions when
you're<00:03:43.860> working<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.250> another<00:03:44.610> thing<00:03:44.820> that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you're working out another thing that

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
you're working out another thing that
can<00:03:45.000> happen<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.420> opposite<00:03:46.110> spectrum<00:03:46.410> what

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
can happen on the opposite spectrum what

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.260 
can happen on the opposite spectrum what
you<00:03:46.800> wouldn't<00:03:47.100> think<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.760> actually<00:03:48.060> will

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
you wouldn't think is it actually will

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.390 
you wouldn't think is it actually will
increase<00:03:48.540> your<00:03:48.930> blood<00:03:49.470> pressure<00:03:49.740> without

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
increase your blood pressure without

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.790 
increase your blood pressure without
enough<00:03:50.850> sodium<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> system<00:03:51.930> over<00:03:52.110> time

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
enough sodium in the system over time

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.980 
enough sodium in the system over time
that<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.400> has<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.550> tremendous<00:03:54.060> effect<00:03:54.209> on

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
that just has a tremendous effect on

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.600 
that just has a tremendous effect on
your<00:03:55.260> heart<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.709> pumping<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.370> blood

through your arteries in your veins

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.290 
through your arteries in your veins
you<00:03:58.620> use<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:58.890> sodium<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.430> an<00:03:59.760> assistant<00:04:00.180> for

you use the sodium as an assistant for

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.120 
you use the sodium as an assistant for
transport<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.930> without<00:04:01.290> enough<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.920> your

recipes at home you can actually take a
lot<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.200> sodium<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.010> calls<00:04:54.220> for<00:04:54.340> in

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580

some<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.460> these<00:04:57.580> recipes<00:04:57.820> have<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.420> using<00:04:58.810> a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
some of these recipes have you using a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.260 
some of these recipes have you using a
quarter<00:04:59.890> of<00:05:00.040> a<00:05:00.100> cup<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.370> third<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.880> cup<00:05:01.030> of

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
quarter of a cup a third of a cup of

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.480 
quarter of a cup a third of a cup of
salt<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.870> that's<00:05:01.990> very<00:05:02.440> very<00:05:02.710> high<00:05:03.070> in<00:05:03.130> sodium

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
salt and that's very very high in sodium

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.340 
salt and that's very very high in sodium
so<00:05:03.820> again<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.630> can<00:05:04.750> either<00:05:04.840> pull<00:05:05.140> some<00:05:05.320> of

so again you can either pull some of

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.930 
so again you can either pull some of
that<00:05:05.440> sodium<00:05:05.830> out<00:05:06.040> or<00:05:06.400> use<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.700> sodium

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
that sodium out or use this sodium

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.490 
that sodium out or use this sodium
replacement<00:05:07.600> hopefully<00:05:07.870> by<00:05:07.990> now<00:05:08.140> you<00:05:08.200> have<00:05:08.470> a
