 Are not you recognizing us? 

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:56.644
 It's looking like "facial blindness" ... 

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.891
 -... Every time you look at someone's face, it's like you've never seen them before ... 

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.334
 -... Including the face of a loved one ... 

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.764
 "... Including your own reflection. 

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:07.295
 - That was found on the bridge ... 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 "No purse, no cell phone." 

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:17.239
 "You look stunning tonight, Anna.

 - It's him, he's here ... 

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.555
 - It could be anyone ... 

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.592
 "You really do not recognize me?" 

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:28.123
 - It has another face ... 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.879
 IN WHAT TO TRUST 

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:30.597
 - The guy is a sadist ... 

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.465
 "She's the one who saw you ..." 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040
 ... and does not recognize anyone 

00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:35.112
 ... His voice does not come out of my damn head! 

00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:37.518
 WHEN THE KILLER 

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:39.286
 - I know your face ... 

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.210
 - ... I've seen her before ... 

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:41.750
 - Not! You do not know my face ... 

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.200
 - ... You do not remember anything! 

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:44.820
 CAN BE ANYONE 

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:46.910
 "I did not expect to see you ..." 

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.680
 I do not remember your name 

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.410
 "You've been a strong, bold woman. 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.190
 - You know who I am. 

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:53.930
 - We can stop this ... 

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:56.300
 - I remember the faces in my dreams ... 

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:02.140
 You're the only people I do not need to hide ... 

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.990
 You're the only one can stop this!
