00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.890 

I<00:00:05.920> think<00:00:06.920> that<00:00:07.130> the<00:00:07.940> brands<00:00:08.330> been<00:00:08.540> around<00:00:08.750> now

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
I think that the brands been around now

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.500 
I think that the brands been around now
for<00:00:08.930> 10<00:00:09.260> years<00:00:09.530> and<00:00:09.950> it<00:00:10.219> has<00:00:10.400> evolved<00:00:11.150> in<00:00:11.240> lots

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
for 10 years and it has evolved in lots

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.660 
for 10 years and it has evolved in lots
of<00:00:11.629> ways<00:00:11.690> I<00:00:11.840> think<00:00:12.200> the<00:00:12.320> biggest<00:00:12.670> evolution

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
of ways I think the biggest evolution

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.710 
of ways I think the biggest evolution
for<00:00:14.179> me<00:00:14.330> is<00:00:14.690> just<00:00:16.000> you<00:00:17.000> know<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.180> learn<00:00:17.480> so

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
for me is just you know you learn so

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.570 
for me is just you know you learn so
much<00:00:17.779> along<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.320> way<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:18.860> like<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:19.310> think<00:00:19.490> the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
much along the way and like I think the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.339 
much along the way and like I think the
biggest<00:00:19.759> thing<00:00:20.000> I've<00:00:20.119> learned<00:00:20.420> is<00:00:20.689> with<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
biggest thing I've learned is with the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.010 
biggest thing I've learned is with the
disappointments<00:00:22.190> some<00:00:23.119> really<00:00:23.390> great<00:00:23.690> like

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
disappointments some really great like

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.750 
disappointments some really great like
things<00:00:24.529> have<00:00:24.710> been<00:00:24.859> born<00:00:25.130> out<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.430> like

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
things have been born out of that like

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.090 
things have been born out of that like
when<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:26.330> have<00:00:26.510> like<00:00:27.170> kind<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.470> limitations

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
when you have like kind of limitations

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.740 
when you have like kind of limitations
sometimes<00:00:28.550> or<00:00:28.789> disappointments<00:00:29.359> you<00:00:29.449> kind<00:00:29.660> of

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
sometimes or disappointments you kind of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.660 
sometimes or disappointments you kind of
have<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:29.960> be<00:00:30.080> extra<00:00:30.560> creative<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.250> I've

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
have to be extra creative and I've

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.520 
have to be extra creative and I've
learned<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.269> not<00:00:32.300> get<00:00:32.689> upset<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.290> really

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
learned to not get upset and to really

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.259 
learned to not get upset and to really
like<00:00:33.769> look<00:00:34.280> at<00:00:34.400> those<00:00:34.580> things<00:00:34.820> those<00:00:35.030> kind<00:00:35.210> of

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
like look at those things those kind of

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.700 
like look at those things those kind of
opportunities<00:00:35.900> to<00:00:35.930> make<00:00:36.260> things<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:36.559> are

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
opportunities to make things that are

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.620 
opportunities to make things that are
great<00:00:36.949> but<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.489> also<00:00:37.670> learned<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:38.270> know<00:00:38.390> I've

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
great but I also learned you know I've

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.360 
great but I also learned you know I've
just<00:00:38.809> learned<00:00:39.050> like<00:00:39.260> what<00:00:39.469> works<00:00:39.710> sometimes

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
just learned like what works sometimes

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.760 
just learned like what works sometimes
and<00:00:40.670> what<00:00:40.760> doesn't<00:00:41.090> work<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.660> like<00:00:41.840> lamb<00:00:42.530> has

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
and what doesn't work and like lamb has

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.030 
and what doesn't work and like lamb has
evolved<00:00:43.600> slowly<00:00:44.600> over<00:00:45.050> these<00:00:45.200> years<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:45.890> know

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
evolved slowly over these years you know

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.250 
evolved slowly over these years you know
I<00:00:46.070> think<00:00:46.340> I've<00:00:46.579> learned<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:46.940> lot<00:00:46.969> about

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
I think I've learned a lot about

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.510 
I think I've learned a lot about
designing<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.559> about<00:00:48.829> what<00:00:49.100> works<00:00:49.309> what

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
designing and about what works what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.029 
designing and about what works what
doesn't<00:00:49.579> work<00:00:49.879> I've<00:00:50.750> learned<00:00:51.140> how<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.559> handle

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
doesn't work I've learned how to handle

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.920 
doesn't work I've learned how to handle
disappointments<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.030> turn<00:00:53.360> them<00:00:53.510> into<00:00:53.600> like

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
disappointments and turn them into like

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.850 
disappointments and turn them into like
creative<00:00:55.059> opportunities<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:57.620> just

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
creative opportunities and it's just

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.680 
creative opportunities and it's just
been<00:00:58.039> like<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.489> growing<00:00:58.850> process<00:00:59.210> because<00:00:59.570> I'm

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
been like a growing process because I'm

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.150 
been like a growing process because I'm
not<00:00:59.809> trained<00:01:00.199> like<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.440> didn't<00:01:00.710> go<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.860> school<00:01:01.010> I

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
not trained like I didn't go to school I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.319 
not trained like I didn't go to school I
don't<00:01:01.250> know<00:01:01.460> what<00:01:01.579> I'm<00:01:01.670> doing<00:01:01.850> I'm<00:01:01.969> really

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
don't know what I'm doing I'm really

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.119 
don't know what I'm doing I'm really
just<00:01:02.480> doing<00:01:02.750> everything<00:01:03.050> from<00:01:03.320> feeling<00:01:03.890> and

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
just doing everything from feeling and

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520 
just doing everything from feeling and
from<00:01:04.280> my<00:01:04.399> heart<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.690> inspiration<00:01:06.259> for<00:01:06.410> this

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
from my heart the inspiration for this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.680 
from my heart the inspiration for this
spring/summer<00:01:07.160> collection<00:01:07.670> was<00:01:07.850> really<00:01:08.270> this

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
spring/summer collection was really this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.780 
spring/summer collection was really this
presentation<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.649> think<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.100> at<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.520> end<00:01:10.549> of

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
presentation I think that at the end of

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.420 
presentation I think that at the end of
the<00:01:10.880> day<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.540> was<00:01:11.720> doing<00:01:12.470> music<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:13.189> had

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
the day like I was doing music I had

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.469 
the day like I was doing music I had
worked<00:01:13.670> really<00:01:13.760> hard<00:01:13.909> on<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.330> no<00:01:14.420> doubt

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
worked really hard on the no doubt

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.340 
worked really hard on the no doubt
collection<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.350> was<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:16.490> know<00:01:16.520> kind<00:01:17.210> of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
collection I was you know kind of

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.510 
collection I was you know kind of
exhausted<00:01:18.350> from<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.530> writing<00:01:18.950> process<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
exhausted from that writing process and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.399 
exhausted from that writing process and
ready<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.820> dive<00:01:20.210> right<00:01:20.479> back<00:01:20.540> into<00:01:20.930> designing

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
ready to dive right back into designing

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.810 
ready to dive right back into designing
and<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.740> really<00:01:22.009> wanted<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.280> breathe<00:01:22.610> new<00:01:22.790> life

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
and I really wanted to breathe new life

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
and I really wanted to breathe new life
into<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.200> lamb

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
into the the lamb

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.740 
into the the lamb
around<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.370> just<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
around again and just I think that you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.230 
around again and just I think that you
know<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.200> didn't<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> exactly<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.090> would

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
know I didn't know exactly that it would

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560 
know I didn't know exactly that it would
end<00:01:30.510> up<00:01:30.630> being<00:01:30.690> as<00:01:31.140> bright<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> colorful<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
end up being as bright and colorful and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
end up being as bright and colorful and
graphic<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> ended<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.229> turning<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.950> like

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
graphic as it ended up turning out like

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
graphic as it ended up turning out like
I<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.470> really

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I just was like I I think that I really

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.230 
I just was like I I think that I really
wanted<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.190> do<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.760> that<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> felt

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
wanted to do something that just felt

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.540 
wanted to do something that just felt
fresh<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.080> I'm<00:01:40.680> always<00:01:40.890> striving<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> make

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
fresh and I'm always striving to make

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.040 
fresh and I'm always striving to make
something<00:01:41.910> that<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> wear<00:01:42.720> every<00:01:42.930> day

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
something that I want to wear every day

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.410 
something that I want to wear every day
but<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.470> still<00:01:43.560> feel<00:01:44.250> comfortable<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.940> it's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
but I still feel comfortable in it's
