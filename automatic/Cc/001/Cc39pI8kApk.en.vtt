00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.410
 champions give and champions come motors 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.450
 champions that seem to always be 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 there but it seems that the ones do not go through 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 them and this is the case of rambo but 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 that has a special direction and why it is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 so powerful the current goal to break that is 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 a champion that practically always 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.890
 is in the competitive in many 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.720
 Sometimes it happens practically 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.610
 unnoticed during the season 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 regular but the world always 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.690
 appear and with front row tickets 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 in baby and backstage 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.420
 he is a champion that because of his 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
 skills is a real pain of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 head the phase of lines mainly 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 after at 7 to 9 which is when 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.190
 if everything goes as it should go 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.589
 gets its first basic object the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.149
 disguise or charmed if in itself it is already 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.920
 a somewhat frustrating encounter in the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770
 low levels from now on it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.600
 turns into a nightmare 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.610
 analyze two skills we can give us 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 realize why it is so strong explained 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.510
 trombone does not use manna what already of by 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.150
 yes it is a point in your favor about 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.710
 mana characters dependent but has 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.570
 a limitation which is the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 overheating every skill that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
 let's use we will start to generate heat 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 when 50% of this bar arrives we enter 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.240
 in the risk zone and this is where 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.710
 we want to stay since being in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 risk zone all your skills 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 they have improvements their cv allows us to do 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.440
 damage an area and due to the current goal the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 100 percent of the tops that are played 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.009
 they are melee so we can 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.720
 spend perfectly to the rival 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.369
 the w gives us a shield and speed of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.800
 excellent movement to escape the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.750
 ambush that allows us to inform and 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.340
 harass from a distance at the same time that we 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 can help escape in a moment of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 danger and finally we will analyze the r 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.720
 its last and the final one is why 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.490
 rhombuses is always in the competitive the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 definitively does a damage incredibly 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
 high and constant for 5 seconds 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.399
 apart from being a damage in area and thanks 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.470
 to the composition of teams that 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.750
 currently play with tons of this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 and things like that is very complicated 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.709
 the power to escape stability damage 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.010
 course he has always been known due 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.200
 to what 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.360
 well positioned can make a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.840
 fight that seems lost turns to its 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.940
 favor 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.920
 apart from that although we go a bit bad 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.050
 online thanks to this skill is very 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.610
 easy to recover we remember that the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.800
 compensation is very dependent on the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.110
 departure but the most common in rhombus is what 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.150
 next the basic diamond damage is already 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.740
 already high because of this that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.540
 you look in rhombus is to accumulate the greatest 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.520
 amount of magical penetration possible 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.320
 to bring our damage closer 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.540
 possible to the actual damage apart from being a 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.890
 incredibly explosive damage that's why 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.600
 that ron ball is built objects 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.990
 like the torment of and andrey center 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.940
 abyssal 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.410
 and quite the emptiness likewise only 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.120
 accompanies almost always with an object 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 defensive which is the hourglass 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 de sonia is the hat of death and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.340
 the striped glass scepter are objects 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.990
 that are built depending on the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.820
 departure the boots are very 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.350
 circumstantial also being able to 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.240
 put on sorcerer's boots we were going 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.890
 pretty fit or something more defensive like 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.870
 the mercury boots with these objects 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.910
 we accumulate too much magic penetration 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.590
 just like ability power thank you 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 to our defensive objects as they are 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.220
 the visual center and the hourglass 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.720
 we become a not so 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.310
 fragile and that can do harm 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.200
 hellish in the fights 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.520
 that's why rambo is almost always 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.250
 in all compositions equipment 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.680
 has very few weaknesses and many 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.840
 many advantages good friends I hope that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.730
 you liked it, remember that 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.080
 can share it and like me 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.209
 like to leave in the comments 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.340
 your experiences playing with rhombuses or 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.810
 even playing against the subject them 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.280
 I remember that I am a 'break' and see you 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.459
 until next time 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.459
 bye
