00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
add to it for example the display is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.460 
add to it for example the display is
coated<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.909> anti-smudge<00:01:27.840> coating<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.380> is

also made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
also made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and
the<00:01:31.200> entire<00:01:31.530> device<00:01:31.829> has<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.280> coated<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the entire device has been coated in a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
the entire device has been coated in a
material<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.229> p2i<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.100> allows<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> have

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
material from p2i that allows it to have

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
material from p2i that allows it to have
some<00:01:36.000> water<00:01:36.210> resistance<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.680> you'll

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
some water resistance as well so you'll

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
some water resistance as well so you'll

quite good in terms of its sharpness and
after<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.880> threw<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.810> couple<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.320> videos

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
after that I threw on a couple of videos
in<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.220> case<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> Transformers<00:02:09.420> trailer

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
in this case the Transformers trailer

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
in this case the Transformers trailer
and<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.349> still<00:02:10.560> found<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.670> enjoyable

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and I still found that it was enjoyable

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.920 
and I still found that it was enjoyable
even<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
even if

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
even if

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I was more used to larger screens that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.059 
I was more used to larger screens that
still<00:02:15.239> was<00:02:15.390> enjoyable<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.049> use<00:02:16.079> even<00:02:16.799> if<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.950> had

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
to squint a little bit because the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.080 
to squint a little bit because the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
the Moto X but that's perfectly fine

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.430 
the Moto X but that's perfectly fine
because<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.389> Moto<00:04:15.569> e<00:04:15.659> is<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:16.079> really
