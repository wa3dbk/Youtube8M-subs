 Hello dear friends with you jiva 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.670
 This is my first video in which I tell you 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.380
 I'll tell you how to make a helmet 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.420
 iron man from the mold and so here 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.810
 did something for those who don't know what 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.500
 such forms this here is cardboard from such here 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:29.779
 boxes 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:35.329
 well, or a living example is such a thing well 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:37.420
 Understandably, I think, so the computer cannot 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.409
 to distinguish 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:47.269
 Yes, so here and in the description will be 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:51.459
 a reference to 3 falco more precisely to links to 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.819
 downloading these two programs this or 

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:57.069

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:13.689
 leaf format well or there like this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.729
 do and here it is if it somehow 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.929
 the scale is where it includes here too 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:25.399
 scale and how would it be responsible for what 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:27.049
 if you want to consider and so everything 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.759

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.659
 changing the link go you can follow 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.659
 VKontakte group 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:58.659
 so first we run bark type u 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.859
 p 3 so 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.479
 the hand is already tired to lie normal 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.909
 why did you not just on the computer 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.379
 Records we take this file 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.290
 and do not worry that he is like this 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:16.390
 It looks like this I installed the theme and so 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.360
 we bring it acura 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 you should be like this 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.879
 on the left we see a 3d model of what 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 It turns out for a sweep here all this then 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:37.870
 that we will print at least for you 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.519
 warn that he would like you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:48.640
 warn that this is card is 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:52.500
 phone and to do this to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.440
 make a model in general need to consider 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.329
 what parts are here 3d what what 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.359
 see where is the part 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.690
 on the 3d model is worth and just click on 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:08.019
 her example we want to know where is this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:14.799
 thing is it where we want to learn about the trouble 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:19.900
 Even here, this little thing that's that's it then 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:23.130
 everything is just enough and so now 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.690
 you print it out 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.889
 here we press the seal 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.380
 you print i have already printed everything also 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.450
 you can download only one of these programs 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.269
 and if you print it right away 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.079
 You can also run this pepakura 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.650
 designer have can use 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.750
 almost nothing has changed here 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.040
 just can not consider clicking on 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.489
 any kind of detail 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.040
 you can only go out or dots 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.560
 if your boss has some 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.879
 another bo3 format or some other 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.300
 fix formats on 4 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:08.840
 generally have to redistribute 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.500
 I think now tell you what we like 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:21.230
 as if for 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:25.580
 already for work already and so that's what 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.620
 printed out that is here tsiferki that 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.450
 can it be convenient to take 6 leaves 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.270
 can be printed if none of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.850
 print then you need to go 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:44.840
 all but if no printer can be left 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:48.040
 I have such a thing in my house there almost 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:53.500
 printed out how he called it forgot 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.500
 here that is, here is all the details here 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.030
 it can be put immediately say 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.940
 scissors do not need that is now I will tell 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.510
 that we will need it in order 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.460
 to cut and make models 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:15.130
 scissors wrong or not manicure 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.430
 perfect don't use 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.960
 they just ruin the waves and so 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:27.800
 throw them away better somewhere and 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.800
 love and clean in general is also necessary 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.920
 stock up a little bit 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.720
 in money but no one and a half thousand but 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.790
 Strovsky 500 rubles so far only got 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.700
 one and a half thousand materials have exactly 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.250
 it is necessary well maybe a little bit smaller as 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:52.220
 material costs 150 rubles somewhere 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:55.430
 baffin can fail somewhere so that's all 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.650
 that we need to get started and 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.520
 forgot to say also we will need 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.940
 glue gun and not writing pen books 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:12.420
 is it already for use 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:14.070
