00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello and welcome the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.779
 friends to another short channel 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.660
 update one or the other has 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 maybe already noticed that today 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.660
 or yesterday so depending on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 one does not appear this video now 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 empire was totally park came the lay 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.830
 because I did not make it anymore 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 to record empire as currently extremely 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 difficult for me I have to go 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.609
 I have to take a little break 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 Right now I just have it like that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.500
 an incredible amount of work that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.120
 difficult is this lps really 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.350
 to plan through you know I give myself 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.820
 always a bit hard at the planning stage 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.219
 and try to pay attention 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 that is also reasonably stringent 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.820
 and play correctly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 and you also have me very many 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 tips are given so great first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.500
 thank you but for a short break 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.329
 I have to do it anyway 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.629
 this also applies to heroes of might and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.940
 magic 5 I'll have a break too 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.280
 have to do 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 there is still missing a single campaign 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 we will play and me too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.039
 will in any case but also make 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 for heroes i need a short 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 Unfortunately, pause is currently not possible 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 that's why I have that right now 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.909
 made that I always spontaneously as a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 short livestream with europe universalis 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.240
 four organizers because I currently too 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 wants to relax a bit while gambling 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.360
 and right now it's just there 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.040
 a few games that we are currently 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.080
 a tiny bit too 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.549
 exhausting that has nothing to do with the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.299
 quality of the games to do in the very 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.540
 opposite 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 but at the moment I go that way 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.400
 currently totally on europe universalis 4 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 from and sox or or afternoon and moved 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.560
 so just like it and if I am 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.579
 the gamble because I stream which is also the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.470
 co project manager test and with marvin and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.149
 egon son will definitely be 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.689
 progress that is so far everything 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.310
 No worries nothing happens 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.079
 so it will continue to fold the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.509
 currently only affects the current 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 empire project and running heroes 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.509
 of might and magic 5 project lines 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.659
 storm is not affected 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.880
 that means also his storm will be 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.930
 appear regularly 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.549
 otherwise very big again 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.200
 thank you first to you for yours 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.200
 understanding for the many positive 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.700
 feedback what i got 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.020
 and I ask again 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.489
 sorry for all those who 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.080
 I met at gamescom and 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.840
 with which I made small info videos 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 I have not uploaded yet 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.390
 I do not have that myself yet 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.950
 managed and that is totally open to me 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.900
 ghost but unfortunately it is currently possible 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.489
 just not different 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.530
 and you know i run this channel 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.959
 seriously and I will seriously them 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.190
 but I have to do that too 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.200
 I noticed and I have 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.660
 especially on vacation I have to remember one 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.670
 a bit shorter two to three 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.110
 Videos partially more per day that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.549
 I just can not do that anymore 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.390
 currently not more and before 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.620
 I'm collapsing here and here on the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.340
 on the last chair together fold 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.290
 I concentrate and focus 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 rather again a let's play but 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.620
 you know i do my projects in 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.840
 the rule to the end and it should be 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.130
 Of course, stay and then thank you 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.769
 First of all, I warmly welcome you 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.459
 for watching 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.170
 Now I still wanted to a few 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.239
 ask you a little moment 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.530
 please so there I am again I have me 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.060
 thought I could just completely 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.019
 Quickly seize the opportunity 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 couple of viewers ask to answer the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.989
 somehow I always order again 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.980
 get put and then I can 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.660
 Maybe now quickly 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.889
 that's the first thing you can do 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.480
 Processor user and what kind of one 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.069
 graphics card and so on and immediately 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.540
 Do you use me go up for a moment 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.130
 my hardware is an exception for me 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.269
 I've already said sometime but 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.639
 many wanted to know that 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.889
 i run my system with an intel 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:35.660
 i7 37 70 cpu so that's the seven 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:40.010
 quad core with 34 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.790
 slash 3.9 ghz I have 16 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.410
 gigabyte ram I really like it 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.489
 corsa so I have actually good 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.540
 I had some experience 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.610
 broken ram latch but 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.500
 which then have the have the then 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.379
 relatively unproblematically swapped the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.650
 actually worked fine and 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.599
 16 gb is more than every human needs 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.239
 but that is somehow cheaper than just 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.560
 8gb strangely enough in 64 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.019
 bit operating system that you need 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.909
 Of course, this one more than 4 gb 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.209
 even at some point 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.989
 can exploit properly and then became 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.519
 i still asked what i was for one 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.320
 video card user in the context 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.090
 be it directly , it is an asus 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.449
 geforce alone in one in via chip 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:32.229
 So a nvidia graphics chip installed in 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:34.599
 an asus model asus gtx 560 ti 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.919
 this is a relatively old model 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.849
 actually there are now 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.800
 much better graphics cards but that 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.810
 Part still works fine 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.490
 and meanwhile it is clear too 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.500
 quieter than in my old apartment there 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.000
 was always kind of strange loud 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.349
 and the acoustics here are now 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.699
 a little better but there is 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.960
 now definitely better 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.729
 graphics cards so now I'll take a look 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.050
 further what is even beginning've had 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.580
 only one question which mote me around here 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.409
 two users or can recommend 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.330
 for rom two I do not use mods 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.760
 That's why I can not recommend it 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.289
 in addition, mod and I can 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.970
 definitely recommend for empire was totally 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.680
 there are also other advantage is dead 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.360
 actually always quite well done 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.190
 Of course you can have a look 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.199
 use at your own risk and so on 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.820
 and so on then there was a bit 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.470
 mess with a stalemate of mine 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.430
 johanniter let's play there is me there 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.289
 unfortunately I have the part eight anyway 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.300
 the lease what do I think I have there 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.530
 loaded an outdated game 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.120
 I forgot to help 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
 just have a game gone out then 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.870
 loaded the old score and then there 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.919
 just played normally that was 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.960
 kinda weird and somehow 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.949
 I'm worried about confusion 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.539
 the place also again 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.050
 excuse me but you have humor 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.720
 took 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.120
 which has then that was actually still 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.130
 very funny then again completely 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.470
 big thank you to my audience i 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.720
 So everybody had a look at all of you 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.490
 of course I had the last one 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.919
 two weeks almost every day more than 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.820
 15,000 video calls this is a new one 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.550
 record mark 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.340
 I'm actually on 6 now 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.380
 millions of video views came up 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.880
 and it is one 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.900
 the absolute madness and there I want 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.310
 me at the place also completely again 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.410
 Thank you very much 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.790
 19,000 subscribers are now 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.220
 Meanwhile we cracked already 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.150
 move to the 20,000 mark to the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.830
 magic border 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.870
 that is definitely the absolute 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.210
 madness and I thank you simply yet 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.350
 sometimes quite so much for so if you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.550
 just ask and have the video 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.080
 I write there under it 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.310
 indicated that put it again 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.650
 it was asked you play 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.450
 again ftl yes I've even been in 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.380
 let's play and it is 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.180
 completed me 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.730
 on the hard disk, it is pegged me 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.290
 I have no question but I watch 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.120
 if I still have the livestream somehow 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.490
 can upload there has been somehow lately 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.870
 a little something hailed again 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.610
 that's what I could say so ftl 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.990
 is in planning there will be something else 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.370
 that has not died for me yet 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.810
 pixel piracy will be over again 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.710
 At some point but there I have to 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.360
 wait a bit longer 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.070
 maybe there are also again so 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.120
 typical livestream games I still have 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.890
 let's do it and maybe 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.900
 I'll take it again sometime 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.520
 I have a weekend just for you 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.220
 time I have to look what time it is 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.270
 maybe even this month 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.040
 then I'll take a weekend 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.420
 for you time after again nice live 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.550
 stream together and a little bit longer 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.380
 then and of course I quit that 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.160
 You can also go to the other side 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.780
 So you herded my table channel 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.340
 may still know my side of the table 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.400
 not me maximum otherwise here in the 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.140
 video description could take a look 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.220
 and there you can get lost you can 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.290
 also just then on the website 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.320
 sometimes it will stay automatic 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.270
 Updated when the stream goes live 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.250
 At least I think follow it is 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.600
 so you can have a look and if so 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.220
 then you hear me at once and then hear 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.470
 you know that the stream is live or 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.850
 you'll just get an email or something 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.470
 similar if the stream then stop 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.790
 I usually do it online 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.190
 so a quarter of an hour before I go 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.360
 really start learning that I'm with 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.680
 the stream go online that the people 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.330
 then still get something directly 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.840
 and get a mail and so on and so on 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.590
 immediately 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.330
 but yes okay well , everybody knows that 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.820
 then again many thanks for your 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.660
 understanding and do not worry me 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.430
 well so far 

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.050
 I just have so much to do 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.340
 do and thank you for your help 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.110
 we'll see each other in 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.360
 any of the upcoming videos again 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.710
 and no concern empire will be too soon 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.380
 I'll say I'll say goodbye 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.380
 until then pax vobis com walid disco
