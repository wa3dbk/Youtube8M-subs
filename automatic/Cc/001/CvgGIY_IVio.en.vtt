two<00:00:27.710> things<00:00:27.980> for<00:00:28.189> us<00:00:28.250> first<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.090> all<00:00:29.180> the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
two things for us first of all the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.910 
two things for us first of all the
isolate<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.840> microphone<00:00:30.200> from<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.439> preamps

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
isolate the microphone from the preamps

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.659 
isolate the microphone from the preamps
so<00:00:31.010> you<00:00:31.070> don't<00:00:31.220> have<00:00:31.279> problems<00:00:31.640> with

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
so you don't have problems with

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.010 
so you don't have problems with
impedance<00:00:32.119> loading<00:00:32.390> like<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:32.750> would<00:00:32.870> have

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020

now<00:01:53.150> we<00:01:53.210> place<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.630> microphones<00:01:54.050> at<00:01:54.230> about

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
now we place the microphones at about

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.900 
now we place the microphones at about
the<00:01:54.500> fourteenth<00:01:54.890> fret<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.340> aiming<00:01:55.610> slightly
