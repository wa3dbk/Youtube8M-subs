00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.280
 video we will teach you to update what 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.950
 which is the new version of the 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.990
 past playstation or the previous version 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.059
 some still have this version 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.879
 but good in this video we will try 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.490
 of let's teach them to install what 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.769
 is the new version ok then what 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.380
 first that we must do then it is 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.230
 download a freckle in which you can 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.570
 find from my facebook or in 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.949
 my blog then then once the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.290
 have downloaded so we're going to 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.760
 install ok I remind you that for 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.020
 install applications because you already know that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.570
 you must mark the origins option 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.300
 unknown since adjustments and then 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 they can now install a pk that is 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.539
 off the track or not ok then well 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 let's explore my files to achieve it 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.899
 I have here in download is this version 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.039
 good is this apk that says with point 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.780
 android dot see vending 4 026 that the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.129
 latest version of the gun 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.629
 so what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:07.680
 install it will throw me this little 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.840
 notice that I do wish to write it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.540
 then once there is already 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.630
 installed I will simply give it in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.050
 open ok and then we would have what is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.760
 the new version of the place to be most 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.790
 is the new version the new interface 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.970
 and then, as we can see, there are both 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.920
 the icons a little bigger than in the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.460
 previous version 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 it's still very fast in fact, because if 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.580
 you leave this sport on your phone 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.040
 then this one 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.080
 let's check what the version is 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.010
 they go in configuration and here we can 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.720
 find it is version 4.0 point 26 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.180
 It is the new version 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.960
 so how do I tell them if they are not yet 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 they are updated to you then install 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.430
 through this apk and they will have 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.190
 what is the new the new version that 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.290
 is this is how you see then as I say 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.020
 the slightly larger icons form 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.940
 to order from also of the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.690
 applications as they are in this way 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 thus 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.260
 is very very very good what is this 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.870
 this new new update some 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.110
 Well, they have already updated and so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.910
 some not ok then as I say 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.270
 then there is that this little video 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.100
 I hope you serve them remember this one the p 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.680
 can be found from the tablet or 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.980
