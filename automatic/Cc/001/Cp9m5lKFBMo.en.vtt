00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.050
 minutes before starting the match between são caetano and são paulo team 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.720
 referee checks the nets analyzes the lawn again together in the middle of the 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.150
 field we hope clubs come into the game someone from the outside shouting 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.130
 good luck paulo caesar or maybe congratulations before the draw of the coin 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.930
 union of the referees of são paulo paid tribute to paulo césar de 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.670
 oliveira for his hundredth performance in the series a-1 of the Paulista championship is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.720
 a homage from São Paulo without water 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.180
 for all sides they are paulo because it is very difficult 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.220
 complete 100 games in São Paulo 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.370
 the average performance the rector gave eight to ten games 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 So when will we be in office? 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.120
 is complete without it because at least ten years of career he has I'm in 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 selection since 97 is ten years 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.520
 despite this number in the first division 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.270
 in the six games then 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.940
 is a really quite important question mark reaching that I 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 I reached in 2007, I hope, who knows when I have another 12 years of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.050
 career can reach 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.780
 teachers who know 311 in the first edition come back very much 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.880
 Now yes 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 the game started 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.480
 end of game fulfilled for the players but not for the team of 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.440
 arbitration 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.050
 after the end of the match the fans still remain in the stadium by at 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.490
 minus another two hours 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.100
 after 90 minutes of play 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.470
 the work of arbitration continues out of the field 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.750
 of course it's time to rest if you hydrate have taken away the radio communicator 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 and discuss some bids of the match 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.440
 but in the big locker room return and the objective of the refereeing team is 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.939
 in completing the scoresheet and now 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.959
 It's the third time, it's for us. 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.859
 here that will be portrayed everything that happens from then on people 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.939
 have to do 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.939
 What did we have to take care of? 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.889
 we have to have to see that fall in the locker room as well as the 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.779
 report is not ready 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.579
 the referees talk and 13 make the match analysis 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.329
 we try 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.829
 It's meeting after game to make a movie right here and that's very important. 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.779
 apostolic 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:42.690
 have to do 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.499
 that's what we agreed that we went wrong 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.329
 and so we have to improve with our partners that we will 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.169
 my shelf life 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.489
 it is difficult for the referee had to hear that he erred in some decisions in the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.240
 match 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.850
 but they guarantee that soon after the game did not care much about it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.679
 gave today is a 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.769
 I feel more relaxed doing the best in the beginning, we have to 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.409
 learn 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.829
 merkel today with 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.150
 all technological resources are used in the transmission 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.399
 as well as for sure it will show some situation that I could not 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.919
 watching during the game the television stations may have picked up 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.590
 I can get the word today 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.269
 I told him I was trying to do my own thing. 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.430
 better and that if everything did not come out 100% as it should but I would head off if a lot 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.820
 Calm down, that's right. 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.659
 what happened happened 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.269
 it is up to the referees to always learn from the mistakes not to lower their heads and 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.370
 to perfect myself, do my self-criticism here, then put the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.629
 cassette tape 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.890
 I'll pass steps missed plays 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.410
 I give more importance to the game 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.700
 I can do my improvement the step in relation to arthur the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.069
 virtual knowledge 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.269
 it was arbitrary 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.170
 people understand that it is only worth so that our heritage with the 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.230
 and very sensibly in a balanced way that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.089
 we feel that we have done the best
