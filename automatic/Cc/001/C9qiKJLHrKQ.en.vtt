00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello my name is gay bunch of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.919
 lime technical adviser to the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.420
 French federation of the mountain and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.190
 of escalate and today I'm going 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 explain how it achieves its 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.280
 bust rings to go perform 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.039
 mountaineering races 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 so I start by making another 8 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.900
 to give me the end of the rope 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.210
 so I 'm doing a half turn a second 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 half turn so a complete turn I take 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.670
 the end of the rope and I pass it in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.449
 the loop 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.590
 and there I induced well simple 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 now to realize my still of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 man I will take the end of the rope 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 the past in the county of the shoulder belt and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.780
 achieve my eight doubles by following the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.780
 rope 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.149
 so here is my intuit and so is there 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.070
 well two bodies everywhere two bodies from here 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.019
 two bodies from here the two bodies get 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.210
 follow everywhere so she comes back here and 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.920
 they come out here to close the knot 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.960
 I do not forget to make small our 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.970
 stop to check that the rope is 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 long enough 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.070
 so now to realize but 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.070
 another goal I'm going to surround the rope 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 around the bust so this way so 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 I make a meal game vader the head 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.190
 see the important thing 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.190
 the bus rings must arrive at 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.860
 brace of the shoulder belt when I arrive 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.819
 at this level actually i'm going to realize a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:39.440
 loop that I will spend in ponte du 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:41.090
 taste driller in my teens so there I 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.810
 pull the loop to have a little bit 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:54.049
 of body and there I will realize a 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 double fishermen to close the halos 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.689
 so the rings have closed is blocked 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.310
 on the laying of the harness and that's it 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.289
 now you know to achieve your 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.799
 nine busts and block them on spawn the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.689
 sling 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.009
 this technique is used for 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.410
 races to stop snow races 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.500
 where we do not need to change the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 length in cordemans by no means it 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.100
 must be used on a hike 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.540
 glacial where we would need the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.540
 rope to take out his companion
