00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.360
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.519
 I come share a new application 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.730
 to watch or download movies 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.740
 series and others from our device 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.600
 blood this new application or 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.400
 update is called play view 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.900
 so then quickly we're going to 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.640
 happen to open here we have them 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.770
 I remember that this type of applications 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.150
 we do not find it in the place thor like that 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.219
 that in the description where it says all 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.750

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.999
 to download it from my blog 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.589
 spot and once I better said the first 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.469
 Once they open this application they will 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.300
 need to login with either your account 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.940
 from 'twitter' on facebook or google + 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.679
 then once we have already done it 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.449
 here we find what is the interface 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.010

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.199

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.680
