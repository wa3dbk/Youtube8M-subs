okay this is my second attempt and let's
hope<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.740> looks<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.160> little<00:00:05.279> better

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
hope that this looks a little better

this<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:05.940> just<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.720> full<00:00:07.080> ivory<00:00:07.649> my<00:00:08.639> way

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
this is just the full ivory my way

like<00:00:12.650> some<00:00:13.650> artists<00:00:14.070> prefer<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.179> very

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
like some artists prefer to do it very

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
like some artists prefer to do it very
evenly<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:20.660> sometimes<00:00:21.660> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
evenly like this but then sometimes it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.630 
evenly like this but then sometimes it's
nice<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.650> work<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.039> piece<00:00:23.390> quite<00:00:24.390> unevenly<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
nice to work a piece quite unevenly so

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.060 
nice to work a piece quite unevenly so
it's<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.060> matter<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.470> how<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.500> slap<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it's just a matter of how you slap it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's just a matter of how you slap it
together<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.880> trim<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.390> I'll

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
together and how your trim it and I'll

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.340 
together and how your trim it and I'll
show<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.630> my<00:00:33.630> formula<00:00:34.320> for

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
show you how I do it my formula for

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
show you how I do it my formula for
ivory<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:37.140> half<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.980> part<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
ivory is as you can see half a part of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
ivory is as you can see half a part of
cadmium<00:00:39.270> yellow<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.930> working<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.410> primo

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
cadmium yellow I'm working with primo

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.410 
cadmium yellow I'm working with primo
and<00:00:41.660> half<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:43.680> piece<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.789> burnt<00:00:45.660> umber<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.370> then

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
and half a piece of burnt umber and then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
and half a piece of burnt umber and then
21<00:00:48.500> pieces<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> white<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
21 pieces of white so that would be a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.619 
21 pieces of white so that would be a
ratio<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:52.129> one<00:00:53.129> cadmium<00:00:53.760> yellow<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.390> burnt

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
ratio of one cadmium yellow one burnt

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.110 
ratio of one cadmium yellow one burnt
umber<00:00:54.899> 240<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.070> white<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> ivory

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
umber 240 to white so this is the ivory

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
umber 240 to white so this is the ivory
that<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> prefer<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> lighter<00:01:01.680> or

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that I get if you prefer a lighter or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
that I get if you prefer a lighter or
darker<00:01:02.010> ivory<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.969> adjust<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.420> colors

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
darker ivory just adjust your colors

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.039 
darker ivory just adjust your colors
accordingly<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.369> piece<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
accordingly then I do a piece of

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.570 
accordingly then I do a piece of
translucent<00:01:07.049> that's<00:01:07.650> approximately<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
translucent that's approximately the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.320 
translucent that's approximately the
same<00:01:08.939> width<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:10.970> make<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:13.100> approximately

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
same width and I make it approximately

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.350 
same width and I make it approximately
the<00:01:15.330> same<00:01:15.540> length<00:01:16.549> I'm<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> worry

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the same length I'm not going to worry

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.649 
the same length I'm not going to worry
about<00:01:18.770> being<00:01:19.770> too<00:01:20.040> exact<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.299> simply<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
about being too exact and it's simply a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
about being too exact and it's simply a
matter<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.189> putting<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
matter of putting one on top of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.050 
matter of putting one on top of the
other<00:01:25.100> I'm<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> roll<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> through<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
other I'm going to roll it through the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
other I'm going to roll it through the
pasta<00:01:27.509> machine<00:01:28.549> on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.299> thickest<00:01:30.689> set<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> now

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pasta machine on the thickest set so now

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
pasta machine on the thickest set so now
I've<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> piece<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:35.159> going

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
I've got a piece like this and I'm going

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.190 
I've got a piece like this and I'm going
to<00:01:35.520> cut<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> into<00:01:37.130> relatively<00:01:38.130> even<00:01:38.520> pieces

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
to cut it into relatively even pieces

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.600 
to cut it into relatively even pieces
let's<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.380> I'll<00:01:40.530> do

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.980 

like<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:47.000> nice<00:01:47.210> thing<00:01:47.240> about<00:01:47.510> doing

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
like that and the nice thing about doing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.720 
like that and the nice thing about doing
it<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.290> way<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.340> worry<00:01:49.550> about

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
it this way is you have to worry about

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.250 
it this way is you have to worry about
how<00:01:50.030> accurately<00:01:50.600> you're<00:01:50.810> putting<00:01:51.140> it

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
how accurately you're putting it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.380 
how accurately you're putting it
together<00:01:52.900> when<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:54.280> put<00:01:55.280> them<00:01:55.460> on<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:56.180> just

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
together when I put them on I just

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.660 
together when I put them on I just
slightly<00:01:56.630> stagger<00:01:57.290> them<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:57.670> they're

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
slightly stagger them so they're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.460 
slightly stagger them so they're
slightly<00:01:58.970> offset<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:03.050> one<00:02:03.260> might

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
slightly offset and this one might

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.200 
slightly offset and this one might
offset<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.340> again<00:02:04.910> like<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:06.820> okay<00:02:07.820> maybe

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
offset it again like that okay maybe

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.800 
offset it again like that okay maybe
I'll<00:02:08.390> offset<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.229> little<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.540> this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I'll offset it a little more do it this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.800 
I'll offset it a little more do it this
way<00:02:15.050> again<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:17.740> whatever<00:02:19.420> okay<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.480> now<00:02:20.720> I've

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
way again and whatever okay so now I've

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.650 
way again and whatever okay so now I've
got<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> sandwich<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:26.750> don't<00:02:27.080> worry<00:02:27.440> about

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
got a sandwich and I don't worry about

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.020 
got a sandwich and I don't worry about
edges<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:30.140> anything<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:33.400> find<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.670> when<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.910> do

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
edges or anything I find that when I do

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.610 
edges or anything I find that when I do
it<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.510> way<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:36.170> get<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.700> best<00:02:38.590> possible

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.650 

I've<00:02:44.069> come<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.940> very<00:02:45.360> random<00:02:46.140> full

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
I've come for very random full

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.500 
I've come for very random full
fossilized<00:02:48.660> bone<00:02:49.550> I'm<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.790> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.120> turning

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
fossilized bone I'm just kind of turning

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.360 
fossilized bone I'm just kind of turning
it<00:02:51.630> into<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.989> square<00:02:54.590> okay<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.920> those<00:02:56.160> are

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it into a square okay now those are

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.460 
it into a square okay now those are
quite<00:02:56.670> thick<00:02:57.270> those<00:02:57.510> stripes<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.080> see<00:02:58.290> these

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
quite thick those stripes you see these

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.940 
quite thick those stripes you see these
stripes<00:02:58.800> are<00:02:59.040> thinner

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
stripes are thinner

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.990 
stripes are thinner
okay<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> basically<00:03:04.769> now<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.790> matter

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
okay so basically now it's just a matter

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.350 
okay so basically now it's just a matter
of

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.140 

this<00:03:14.230> plastic<00:03:14.560> sheet<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.190> moving<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:15.970> makes

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
this plastic sheet is moving so it makes

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.130 
this plastic sheet is moving so it makes
it<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> little<00:03:16.480> more<00:03:16.630> difficult<00:03:17.440> for<00:03:17.710> me<00:03:19.140> little

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
it a little more difficult for me little

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.790 
it a little more difficult for me little
bit<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.910> going<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> roll<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.540> out<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:23.020> bit

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
bit I'm going to roll it out a bit

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.180 
bit I'm going to roll it out a bit
lengthwise<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:26.260> cut<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.680> tacit

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
lengthwise and probably cut this tacit

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.340 
lengthwise and probably cut this tacit
one<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:27.640> time<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.940> can<00:03:34.090> pull<00:03:34.450> on<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.900> really

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
one more time you can pull on it really

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.540 
one more time you can pull on it really
doesn't<00:03:35.710> matter<00:03:35.830> just<00:03:36.250> gets<00:03:36.460> very

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
doesn't matter just gets very

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.590 
doesn't matter just gets very
interesting<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.300> they're

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
interesting and you can see they're

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.590 
interesting and you can see they're
still<00:03:43.930> fairly<00:03:44.260> thick<00:03:45.060> relative<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.450> other

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
still fairly thick relative to the other

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.750 
still fairly thick relative to the other
one<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:48.010> I'm<00:03:48.250> going<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:49.680> flip<00:03:50.680> them<00:03:51.100> now<00:03:51.340> so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
one so I'm going to flip them now so

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.030 
one so I'm going to flip them now so
that<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:55.360> translucent<00:03:56.320> up<00:03:56.470> here<00:03:56.860> is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that I get the translucent up here is

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.320 
that I get the translucent up here is
now<00:03:57.250> down<00:03:57.550> here<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:59.670> that's<00:04:00.670> going<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.150> give

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
now down here and that's going to give

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.800 
now down here and that's going to give
me<00:04:02.190> some<00:04:03.190> more<00:04:03.430> randomness<00:04:04.090> I'm<00:04:04.600> going<00:04:04.750> to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
me some more randomness I'm going to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.350 
me some more randomness I'm going to
roll<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.110> out<00:04:05.200> one<00:04:05.440> more<00:04:05.530> time<00:04:09.239> you're<00:04:10.239> going

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
roll it out one more time you're going

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.660 
roll it out one more time you're going
to<00:04:10.450> get<00:04:10.630> some<00:04:10.870> movement<00:04:11.080> on<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.980> edges<00:04:12.430> since

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
to get some movement on the edges since

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.920 
to get some movement on the edges since
the<00:04:12.850> edges<00:04:13.239> were<00:04:13.420> not<00:04:13.630> totally<00:04:14.290> flat

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.350 

one<00:04:19.930> more<00:04:20.109> time<00:04:22.919> at<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.129> stage<00:04:24.610> some<00:04:24.970> artists

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
one more time at the stage some artists

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.070 
one more time at the stage some artists
prefer<00:04:25.599> to<00:04:26.050> even<00:04:26.409> up<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.710> edges<00:04:27.129> but<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:28.080> don't

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
prefer to even up the edges but I don't

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.580 
prefer to even up the edges but I don't
I<00:04:30.150> kind<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.479> what<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.750> get<00:04:32.550> when<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.580> do<00:04:33.729> this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
I kind of like what I get when I do this

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.950 
I kind of like what I get when I do this
and<00:04:35.590> I've<00:04:35.830> got<00:04:36.039> a<00:04:36.069> very<00:04:36.490> fine<00:04:36.849> stripe<00:04:37.389> on<00:04:37.659> this

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and I've got a very fine stripe on this

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.770 
and I've got a very fine stripe on this
one<00:04:38.199> this<00:04:38.349> one<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.940> quite<00:04:39.940> fine

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
one this one is quite fine

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.580 
one this one is quite fine
so<00:04:41.620> it'd<00:04:41.770> be<00:04:41.800> interesting<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.789> can<00:04:43.750> compress<00:04:44.319> it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
so it'd be interesting I can compress it

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.969 
so it'd be interesting I can compress it
a<00:04:44.680> little<00:04:44.919> bit<00:04:45.159> I<00:04:45.960> don't<00:04:46.960> want<00:04:47.379> it<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.620> be<00:04:47.770> that

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
a little bit I don't want it to be that

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.230 
a little bit I don't want it to be that
long<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.900> I'm<00:04:49.900> going<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.340> continue<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.580> shape

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
long and I'm going to continue to shape

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.790 
long and I'm going to continue to shape
it<00:04:52.449> again<00:04:53.069> being<00:04:54.069> very<00:04:54.130> scientific<00:04:55.000> here<00:04:55.800> and

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
it again being very scientific here and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.870 
it again being very scientific here and
this<00:04:57.610> will<00:04:57.849> give<00:04:58.030> me<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.210> really<00:04:58.599> nice<00:04:58.960> random

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
this will give me a really nice random

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.140 
this will give me a really nice random
pattern<00:05:01.169> pretty

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:16.019 

very<00:05:06.960> interesting

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:38.750 

okay<00:05:19.539> just<00:05:20.539> gently<00:05:22.059> even<00:05:23.059> it<00:05:23.180> out

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.440 

okay<00:05:40.650> so<00:05:41.650> now<00:05:41.860> I'm<00:05:42.130> going<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.640> trim<00:05:43.030> off<00:05:43.090> the

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
okay so now I'm going to trim off the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:52.500 
okay so now I'm going to trim off the
piece<00:05:43.720> and<00:05:44.050> see<00:05:44.470> how<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:44.890> looks<00:05:50.670> if<00:05:51.670> you<00:05:52.270> cut

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
piece and see how this looks if you cut

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.930 
piece and see how this looks if you cut
this<00:05:52.720> way<00:05:53.020> you're<00:05:53.830> moving<00:05:54.010> a<00:05:54.220> lot<00:05:54.400> of<00:05:54.520> clay<00:05:54.790> at

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
this way you're moving a lot of clay at

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.020 
this way you're moving a lot of clay at
once<00:05:55.180> but<00:05:55.510> if<00:05:55.660> you<00:05:55.690> cut<00:05:56.020> sort<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.500> like<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:59.520> on<00:06:00.520> an

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
once but if you cut sort of like a on an

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.820 
once but if you cut sort of like a on an
angle<00:06:01.630> like<00:06:01.780> this<00:06:01.840> as<00:06:02.260> though<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.800> a

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
angle like this as though you have a

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.560 
angle like this as though you have a
fulcrum<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:03.640> you<00:06:03.730> move<00:06:03.910> it<00:06:04.060> down<00:06:04.090> you're

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
fulcrum and you move it down you're

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.420 
fulcrum and you move it down you're
moving<00:06:04.960> through<00:06:05.170> less<00:06:06.810> distance<00:06:07.810> and<00:06:08.310> here<00:06:09.310> is

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
moving through less distance and here is

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.670 
moving through less distance and here is
our<00:06:09.610> ivory<00:06:09.850> although<00:06:10.630> it's<00:06:10.750> very<00:06:10.840> close<00:06:11.380> now

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
our ivory although it's very close now

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.920 
our ivory although it's very close now
to<00:06:11.740> this<00:06:12.070> but<00:06:12.430> nice<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.670> random<00:06:14.970> and<00:06:15.970> you<00:06:16.750> see

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
to this but nice and random and you see

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.740 
to this but nice and random and you see
you<00:06:17.080> can<00:06:17.260> mess<00:06:17.470> up<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:18.420> patterning<00:06:19.420> just<00:06:19.600> by

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
you can mess up the patterning just by

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.600 
you can mess up the patterning just by
throwing<00:06:19.960> in<00:06:20.260> some<00:06:20.440> translucent<00:06:20.980> into<00:06:21.490> the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
throwing in some translucent into the

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.950 
throwing in some translucent into the
middle<00:06:21.880> but<00:06:22.060> this<00:06:22.180> gives<00:06:22.420> you<00:06:22.540> some<00:06:22.720> really

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
middle but this gives you some really

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.000 
middle but this gives you some really
nice<00:06:23.290> ends<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.250> can<00:06:24.430> overlap<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.680> I'll

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
nice ends that you can overlap so I'll

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.060 
nice ends that you can overlap so I'll
do<00:06:27.550> some<00:06:27.610> cutting<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.620> wrapping<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.740> things
