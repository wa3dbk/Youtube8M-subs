stitch<00:00:25.590> pattern<00:00:27.199> Melonie<00:00:28.199> question<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:30.410> how

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
stitch pattern Melonie question is how

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
stitch pattern Melonie question is how
to<00:00:31.439> increase<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> end<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.850> stitch<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.510> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to increase at the end of stitch so that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.639 
to increase at the end of stitch so that
it<00:00:33.899> looked<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.860> knit<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> purl<00:00:36.079> in<00:00:37.079> every

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it looked like it knit and purl in every

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.160 
it looked like it knit and purl in every
stitch<00:00:38.180> every<00:00:39.180> row<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
stitch every row that you have to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.729 
stitch every row that you have to
increase<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.870> Melanie<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> found<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> best

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
increase so Melanie I found the best

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
increase so Melanie I found the best
method<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.390> without

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
method of doing this without

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
method of doing this without
interrupting<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.550> last<00:00:47.820> stitch<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.010> just

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
interrupting the last stitch so you just

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
interrupting the last stitch so you just
go<00:00:51.210> ahead<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.719> work<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.199> row<00:00:52.469> until<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> end

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
go ahead and work your row until the end

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.880 
go ahead and work your row until the end
and<00:00:54.289> once<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.590> come<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:57.239> end<00:00:57.890> you're

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and once you come to the end you're

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.360 
and once you come to the end you're
going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> increase<00:00:59.550> a<00:01:00.079> stitch<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.350> casting<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
going to increase a stitch by casting on

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.520 
going to increase a stitch by casting on
so<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:04.040> just<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.220> single<00:01:06.229> cast<00:01:07.229> on

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so I'm using just a single cast on

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.960 
so I'm using just a single cast on
method<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> some

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
method so what you have to do it is some

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.080 
method so what you have to do it is some
get<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.270> index<00:01:13.020> finger<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> wrap<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.060> yarn

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
get your index finger and wrap the yarn

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
get your index finger and wrap the yarn
around<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:17.509> make<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> loop<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
around it and then make a loop at the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.870 
around it and then make a loop at the
end<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:22.350> needle<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:24.290> pull<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.610> way

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
end of your needle and pull so this way

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
end of your needle and pull so this way
you<00:01:26.939> gain<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> stitch<00:01:27.900> without<00:01:28.350> interrupting

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you gain a stitch without interrupting

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
you gain a stitch without interrupting
your<00:01:29.340> last<00:01:29.640> seed<00:01:30.270> stitch<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
your last seed stitch and then you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
your last seed stitch and then you
turned<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.930> seed

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
turned and you just work your seed

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.999 
turned and you just work your seed
stitch<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.530> usual<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> where<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> lot

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
stitch as usual and this is where a lot

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.840 
stitch as usual and this is where a lot
of<00:01:41.070> people<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.939> mixed<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.450> including<00:01:43.079> me

Piper

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.290 

and<00:02:14.360> then<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.950> part<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> important<00:02:17.060> pulled

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and then this part is important pulled

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.110 
and then this part is important pulled
it<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.570> little<00:02:17.870> tight<00:02:18.170> than<00:02:18.680> usual<00:02:19.220> because

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
it a little tight than usual because

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.950 
it a little tight than usual because
your<00:02:20.360> cast<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.470> going<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.160> loose<00:02:22.460> and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
your cast on is is going to be loose and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.870 
your cast on is is going to be loose and
then<00:02:23.960> net<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:26.710> then<00:02:27.710> pull<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.370> back<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
then net and then pull so you go back to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.410 
then net and then pull so you go back to
your<00:02:32.500> normal<00:02:33.500> sees<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.400> pattern<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.680> then

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
your normal sees this pattern and then

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.780 
your normal sees this pattern and then
go<00:02:38.420> back<00:02:38.750> until<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.230> end<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.800> do<00:02:40.220> increase

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
go back until the end and do increase

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.260 
go back until the end and do increase
the<00:02:41.000> same<00:02:41.240> way<00:02:41.480> again<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.730> how<00:02:43.970> my

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
the same way again and this is how my

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.890 
the same way again and this is how my
look<00:02:45.130> at<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.280> end<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.420> best<00:02:53.630> way

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
look at the end so this is the best way

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.930 
look at the end so this is the best way
I<00:02:53.930> file<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.270> keep<00:02:56.270> your<00:02:56.600> C<00:02:56.810> stitch<00:02:57.200> looking

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
I file and keep your C stitch looking

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.460 
I file and keep your C stitch looking
neat<00:02:59.410> rather<00:03:00.410> than<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.390> know<00:03:02.420> knit<00:03:02.960> one<00:03:03.200> purl

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
neat rather than you know knit one purl

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.350 
neat rather than you know knit one purl
one<00:03:03.710> knit<00:03:03.890> one<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> back<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.240> front

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
one knit one in the back in the front

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
one knit one in the back in the front
and<00:03:05.900> make<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.470> little<00:03:06.920> bit<00:03:07.220> messy<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.900> hope

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
and make it a little bit messy so I hope
