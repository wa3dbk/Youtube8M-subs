00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
second advantage what I believe it's

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.830

better<00:04:15.189> on<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.340> info<00:04:15.699> on<00:04:15.729> card<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.209> he<00:04:16.449> speed

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
better on the info on card is he speed

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.990 
better on the info on card is he speed
the<00:04:17.320> Norton<00:04:17.590> form<00:04:17.769> cards<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.280> know<00:04:18.400> wasn't

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
the Norton form cards you know wasn't

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.539 
the Norton form cards you know wasn't
exactly<00:04:19.269> laggy<00:04:19.810> or<00:04:20.139> lat<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.889> know<00:04:21.039> lacking

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
exactly laggy or lat you know lacking

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.120 
exactly laggy or lat you know lacking
behind<00:04:21.699> in<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.330> speed<00:04:22.599> but<00:04:23.080> his<00:04:23.500> inform<00:04:23.889> card

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
behind in the speed but his inform card

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.540 
behind in the speed but his inform card
is<00:04:24.340> dramatically<00:04:25.090> better<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:26.250> expect<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.400> if

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
is dramatically better so expect that if

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.080 
is dramatically better so expect that if
you<00:04:27.700> do

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
you do

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.110
