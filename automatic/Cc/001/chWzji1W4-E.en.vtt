00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.650
 The landmarks I have to say are 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.519
 forget that you're all in the same 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.910
 situation 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 This does not mean that 90% of you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 do not know my college 90% you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.330
 go different speed 90% you do not 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.519
 have to pitch have no problems 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.529
 to give the first twist and talk to the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 people introduced these people and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 try to make friends 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.460
 No one is going to make a strange face or 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 You want a place, and you do not have 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 Everybody was inspired. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 For arranging friends, they are all alone. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 You want me not to want to use a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 belly hurts and I 'm not ashamed to be 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 This is a primary friend at the same time. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 take into account that you all in the same 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.329
 situation 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 I'm not ashamed of the praxes. 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
 are the praxes that the first immense and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 and I think it was because I do not feel 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 shame that I needed to do all the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.589
 we have to go through the same 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.689
 everyone will go through the same and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.700
 no history gives to you usually 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.220
 God who's always given to do not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.320
 Everybody is going to give it to you, you know that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 more likely it will happen to them 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.159
 and they too are ashamed do not have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.659
 Talk, I'm not ashamed to go to 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.520
 up'm ashamed to do things 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 historical or ask things 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.939
 other second tip i tried this one 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.680
 because you are going to do the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 first mix will not be required to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 interact with other people 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.930
 from then on we'll release their name from them 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 and let's start walking with them for 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.579
 the great example to integrate 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.150
 I want to tell you who the mind set is. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.150
 not liking not messi was not nothing 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 tron 12 or anything of rape or anything 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.770
 Let's go clinically easily there 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.320
 because it's the best place to do n 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.750
 third tip to seven people with whom 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.880
 You're going to walk initially are not going to be 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.930
 the same with whom you will give in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.270
 end of semester 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.840
 You will meet people and we will 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.340
 have people complete more in 35 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 eventually the amount spent recognized 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 initially and will pass other 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.640
 feel the police are completely normal 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.080
 You are not alone 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.420
 Let's call the first one. 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.160
 ahead and even knew that the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 people you're giving yourself 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.630
 are most appropriate for you we 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.050
 You worry you'll get there and there is no 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.650
 symptom when they move 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.560
 completely normal 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.380
 another tip that goes from the university are 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.510
 you yourself because you honestly do not 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.300
 values ​​no one cares what 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 you dress look like for rossi champion 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.460
 What do you do differently than you do? 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.260
 do this apply to the situations of the day 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.960
 to the day and the situations of presentations 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.390
 Nobody cares, no one cares. 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.710
 comment on other mentalities and this 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.959
 really does anyone comment 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.510
 stupid is having a mentality 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.100
 extremely childish and does not seem 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 really our attention three have to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 perfect opportunity for you 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 embraced in what I can really be 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.450
 accurate with 12 to his style and even 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.130
 hear that hotels do and accuses ps 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.650
 not worry about criticism is not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.610
 because I will not see criticism of the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.140
 what do you think? 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.090
 I think the need is a very 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400
 but remembered that you found much more 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.080
 easily site thing that I continue 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 scolari because there was always that I had 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.980
 with different people at college 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.800
 which has an added value consisting of 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.380
 So take advantage of this and leave. 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.000
 our own values ​​to be ashamed is 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.790
 unnecessary character will be in the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.850
 same situation other that go 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.010
 people even if it was not the name 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.900
 It's a mid- week mention and you do not 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
 want to keep up with classes and not with 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.870
 I have be home and back to 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.910
 classes or how you will sleep on the street 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.070
 but do not worry because when you 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.050
 there's no going to be someone else at the end of the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.970
 night will offer a house even not 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.970
 I can get a house ready for people. 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.420
 my house because nobody is sleeping in 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.610
 street so go to the parties, not even 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 I have not even slept the last time I want 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.040
 I do not want to seem an influence here. 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.859
 We 're leaving the holidays, you do not like it. 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.650
 you are not in front of you. 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.410
 get worried you'll know 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.780
 but nothing pb obviously a but you do not 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.910
 will believe 4 euros in a white bible 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.350
 when wine and 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.090
 beer 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.910
 I'm going to make another video today of 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 Back to school lesson and today goes 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.190
