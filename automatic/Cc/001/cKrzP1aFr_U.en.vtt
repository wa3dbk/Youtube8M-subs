battlefield<00:00:55.379> 3<00:00:55.620> anymore<00:00:55.859> because<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
battlefield 3 anymore because it's so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.069 
battlefield 3 anymore because it's so
laggy<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.239> bumpy<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
laggy and it's really bumpy it's just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.729 
laggy and it's really bumpy it's just
kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> awkward<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> game<00:01:03.420> did<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:03.989> design

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
kind of awkward the game did not design

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
kind of awkward the game did not design
itself<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.670> let<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> come<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:06.870> out

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
itself to let you come all the way out

itself to let you come all the way out
here<00:01:07.440> on<00:01:07.620> this<00:01:07.860> island<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.350> out

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
here on this island but when you're out

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.069 
here on this island but when you're out
here<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.400> island<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.270> go<00:01:12.540> ahead<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
here on this island you can go ahead and

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.050 
here on this island you can go ahead and
stand<00:01:13.829> at<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> top<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.240> pull<00:01:15.869> out

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
stand at the top of it and just pull out

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
stand at the top of it and just pull out
scope<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> entire<00:01:18.600> map<00:01:18.900> probably<00:01:19.590> hit<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
scope the entire map probably hit one of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
scope the entire map probably hit one of
the<00:01:20.070> world's<00:01:20.340> longest<00:01:20.549> headshots<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the world's longest headshots if you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200 
the world's longest headshots if you
felt<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.079> but<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:23.790> won't<00:01:24.090> hit

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
felt like it but I'm probably won't hit

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.020 
felt like it but I'm probably won't hit
one<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.899> not<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.200> worry<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
one so I'm not gonna worry about that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
one so I'm not gonna worry about that

now if you walk to the very end of the
island<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.759> glitch<00:01:33.299> yourself

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
island you can glitch yourself

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.160 
island you can glitch yourself
underneath<00:01:34.579> this<00:01:35.630> island<00:01:36.630> which<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.140> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
straight into and through the island

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.260 
straight into and through the island
because

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
because

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.150 
because
the<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.900> did<00:02:16.110> not<00:02:16.140> design<00:02:16.560> itself<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.100> you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the game did not design itself for you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.440 
the game did not design itself for you
to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.580> way<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:17.820> let<00:02:18.180> me<00:02:18.240> let<00:02:18.420> me

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
to be all the way out here let me let me

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.990 
to be all the way out here let me let me
show<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:19.340> way<00:02:20.340> off<00:02:20.520> coast<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:22.220> once<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.490> get

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
show you way off coast and once you get

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
show you way off coast and once you get
see<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> part<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.380> basically<00:02:26.040> just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
see this part you can basically just

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.180 
see this part you can basically just
brace<00:02:26.580> yourself<00:02:27.030> through<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> island<00:02:28.190> not

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
brace yourself through the island not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.590 
brace yourself through the island not
not<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.640> even<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.850> breeze<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.210> basically

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
not really even a breeze just basically

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.290 
not really even a breeze just basically
put<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> through<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:32.250> my<00:02:32.820> screen<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
put you through so on my screen it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.450 
put you through so on my screen it
appears<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.810> though<00:02:33.840> I'm<00:02:34.320> standing<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
appears as though I'm standing up but

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
appears as though I'm standing up but
I'm<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.510> Nick<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:37.020> now<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
I'm just like Nick right now I'm in the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.320 
I'm just like Nick right now I'm in the
water<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.760> walk<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.030> bit<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
water so if you walk a little bit to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.820 
water so if you walk a little bit to
your<00:02:39.420> left<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.960> can<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.350> continue<00:02:40.800> to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
your left you can just continue to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.940 
your left you can just continue to
breach<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> go<00:02:42.180> farther<00:02:42.690> into<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> actual

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
breach and go farther into the actual

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.970 
breach and go farther into the actual
island<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> great<00:02:45.990> spot<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.320> go<00:02:46.650> afk

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
island this is a great spot to go afk

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
island this is a great spot to go afk
pretty<00:02:47.820> sure<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.180> never<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.780> hit<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
pretty sure you're never going to hit a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.760 
pretty sure you're never going to hit a
keel<00:02:49.170> from<00:02:49.350> back<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.740> because<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
keel from back here because of all the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.190 
keel from back here because of all the
problems<00:02:52.770> with<00:02:52.920> shooting<00:02:53.870> look<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.110> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
problems with shooting look at that I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.860 
problems with shooting look at that I
can't<00:02:55.410> even<00:02:55.470> switch<00:02:55.680> back<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.950> my<00:02:56.190> primary

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.610 

basically<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.320> breach

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
basically you just have to breach

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.800 
basically you just have to breach
yourself<00:03:02.010> through<00:03:02.280> all<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:03.180> material<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
yourself through all this material and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.990 
yourself through all this material and
try<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.320> as<00:03:04.410> far<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.700> not

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
try and get as far as you can I'm not

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.310 
try and get as far as you can I'm not
sure<00:03:06.270> if<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.510> could<00:03:06.690> get<00:03:06.840> any<00:03:06.960> farther<00:03:07.110> than

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
sure if you could get any farther than

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.670 
sure if you could get any farther than
this<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.270> gonna<00:03:09.420> attempt<00:03:10.110> let's<00:03:10.440> see

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
this but I'm gonna attempt let's see

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.860 
this but I'm gonna attempt let's see
maybe<00:03:13.680> not<00:03:13.890> okay<00:03:14.190> well<00:03:14.640> anyways<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.450> go

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
maybe not okay well anyways if you go

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.340 
maybe not okay well anyways if you go
back<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.350> way<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.920> came<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:19.170> can

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
back the way that you came you can

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.380 
back the way that you came you can
actually<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:20.220> back<00:03:20.460> inside<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.880> map<00:03:21.120> without

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
actually get back inside the map without

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.390 
actually get back inside the map without
having<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.720> commit<00:03:21.930> suicide<00:03:22.250> because<00:03:23.250> you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
having to commit suicide because you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.120 
having to commit suicide because you
know<00:03:23.520> nobody<00:03:23.820> needs<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.120> commit<00:03:24.330> suicide<00:03:25.130> once

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
know nobody needs to commit suicide once

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.630 
know nobody needs to commit suicide once
you<00:03:27.320> breach<00:03:28.320> yourself<00:03:28.740> all<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.130> way<00:03:29.250> back<00:03:29.460> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
you breach yourself all the way back to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.680 
you breach yourself all the way back to
the<00:03:29.730> water<00:03:29.970> which<00:03:30.950> really<00:03:31.950> takes<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.280> while<00:03:32.690> you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
the water which really takes a while you

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.250 
the water which really takes a while you
can<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:34.110> back<00:03:34.950> outside<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:37.080> actual

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
can get back outside of the actual

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.940 
can get back outside of the actual
island<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.280> swim<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:39.060> normal<00:03:39.690> again<00:03:39.950> once

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
island and swim like normal again once

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.340 
island and swim like normal again once
you're<00:03:41.100> doing<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:42.510> basically<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:43.230> to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
you're doing this you basically have to

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.540 
you're doing this you basically have to
look<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:43.590> your<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:43.830> mini-map<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
look at your little mini-map at the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.300 
look at your little mini-map at the
bottom-left<00:03:44.940> corner<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:46.050> once<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:46.950> get<00:03:47.160> to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
bottom-left corner and once you get to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.220 
bottom-left corner and once you get to
where<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.580> actually<00:03:47.940> shows<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.510> design<00:03:48.900> of

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
where it actually shows the design of

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.860 
where it actually shows the design of
this<00:03:49.860> island<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:51.210> how<00:03:51.330> right<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:51.660> it's<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
this island see how right now it's a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.270 
this island see how right now it's a
straight<00:03:52.200> line<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.130> that

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
straight line but then you can see that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.660 
straight line but then you can see that
curve<00:03:53.670> right<00:03:54.920> passive<00:03:55.920> spawn<00:03:56.160> beacon<00:03:56.490> once

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
curve right passive spawn beacon once

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.790 
curve right passive spawn beacon once
you<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.390> part<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.230> climb<00:03:58.740> back

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
you get to that part you can climb back

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920 
you get to that part you can climb back
up<00:03:59.430> onto<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.790> island<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.240> if<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.480> felt<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
up onto the island and if you felt the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.600 
up onto the island and if you felt the
need<00:04:00.960> to<00:04:01.260> swim<00:04:01.560> all<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.040> way<00:04:02.160> back<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.520> the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
need to swim all the way back to the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.740 
need to swim all the way back to the
shore<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:04.070> act<00:04:05.070> as<00:04:05.400> if<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.760> were<00:04:05.790> never<00:04:06.150> afk

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
shore and act as if you were never afk

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.140 
shore and act as if you were never afk
hiding<00:04:07.170> underneath<00:04:07.470> an<00:04:07.920> island<00:04:08.340> three<00:04:08.910> miles
