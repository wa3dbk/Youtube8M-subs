00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
stumbled out of the gate big time but

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
stumbled out of the gate big time but
they've<00:00:37.590> been<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.010> five<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.460> NHL<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.210> a

they've been top five in the NHL for a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.610 
they've been top five in the NHL for a
couple<00:00:39.570> months<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.590> only

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
couple months now and really the only

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
couple months now and really the only
way<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> place<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
way to get to that place is to have a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
way to get to that place is to have a
good<00:00:42.960> team<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:43.559> includes<00:00:43.980> having<00:00:44.219> good

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
good team which includes having good

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
good team which includes having good
chemistry<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> usually<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> gets<00:00:45.750> pretty

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
chemistry and usually that gets pretty

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
chemistry and usually that gets pretty
complicated<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> add<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> major<00:00:47.460> piece

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
complicated when you add a major piece

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
complicated when you add a major piece
and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> jail<00:00:49.320> within<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and then have to jail within like a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
and then have to jail within like a
dozen<00:00:50.430> games<00:00:50.640> before<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> playoffs<00:00:51.480> based<00:00:51.840> on

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
dozen games before the playoffs based on

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.270 
dozen games before the playoffs based on
the<00:00:52.140> performance<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.649> Canucks<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the performance that Canucks had in the

the performance that Canucks had in the
playoffs<00:00:53.640> last<00:00:53.910> season<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.960> grit<00:00:55.230> would

playoffs last season a little grit would

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
playoffs last season a little grit would
help<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.039> least<00:00:56.190> fight<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.910> when
