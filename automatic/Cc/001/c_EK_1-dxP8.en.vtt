00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
exciting but at the same time
I<00:02:00.950> highly<00:02:01.950> doubt<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.340> Pangu<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:03.240> actually

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I highly doubt the Pangu would actually

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.499 
I highly doubt the Pangu would actually
release<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.560> number<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.509> there

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
release this because number one there

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.779 
release this because number one there
would<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.750> no<00:02:07.020> point<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.950> iOS<00:02:08.340> 8<00:02:08.489> point

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
would be no point to do that iOS 8 point

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270 
would be no point to do that iOS 8 point
4<00:02:08.970> point<00:02:09.179> 1<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.780> adds<00:02:09.989> no<00:02:10.379> features<00:02:10.920> over

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
4 point 1 really adds no features over

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.949 
4 point 1 really adds no features over
iOS<00:02:11.610> 8

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
iOS 8

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.140 
iOS 8
for<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.409> adds<00:02:12.620> some<00:02:13.310> nice<00:02:13.459> bug<00:02:13.760> fixes<00:02:14.120> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
for it adds some nice bug fixes and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.640 
for it adds some nice bug fixes and
improvements<00:02:14.329> and<00:02:14.810> yes<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.200> would<00:02:15.349> love<00:02:15.500> to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
improvements and yes I would love to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.339 
improvements and yes I would love to
jailbreak<00:02:16.189> it<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:17.239> at<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.450> same<00:02:17.659> time<00:02:17.989> it

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
jailbreak it but at the same time it

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.349 
jailbreak it but at the same time it
would<00:02:18.469> be<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.980> much<00:02:19.430> smarter<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:20.090> them<00:02:20.239> to

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
would be so much smarter for them to

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.479 
would be so much smarter for them to
save<00:02:20.569> these<00:02:20.810> exploits<00:02:21.379> used<00:02:21.799> on<00:02:22.010> Iowa's<00:02:22.340> eight

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
save these exploits used on Iowa's eight

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.580 
save these exploits used on Iowa's eight
point<00:02:22.730> four<00:02:22.909> point<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:23.359> and<00:02:23.629> put<00:02:24.439> them

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
point four point one and put them

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.309
