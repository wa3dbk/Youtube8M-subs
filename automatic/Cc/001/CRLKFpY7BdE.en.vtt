PlayStation Move and connect that's not

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.050 
PlayStation Move and connect that's not
the<00:06:02.410> case<00:06:02.560> now<00:06:02.620> yes<00:06:03.010> Microsoft<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.610> including

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
the case now yes Microsoft is including

the case now yes Microsoft is including
the<00:06:04.120> connect<00:06:04.390> with<00:06:04.450> some<00:06:04.720> bundles<00:06:04.990> now<00:06:05.410> but

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
the connect with some bundles now but

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.620 
the connect with some bundles now but
that<00:06:06.040> was<00:06:06.160> not<00:06:06.280> the<00:06:06.340> case<00:06:06.700> because<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.360> Kinect

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
that was not the case because the Kinect

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.030 
that was not the case because the Kinect
hasn't<00:06:07.900> always<00:06:08.020> been<00:06:08.140> out<00:06:08.380> since<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.710> xbox

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040

hasn't always been out since the xbox
360<00:06:09.520> released<00:06:09.850> I<00:06:10.150> think<00:06:11.050> that's<00:06:11.170> actually

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
360 released I think that's actually

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.050 
360 released I think that's actually
going<00:06:11.500> to<00:06:11.590> change<00:06:11.770> with<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.010> next<00:06:12.220> Xbox<00:06:12.610> but

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
going to change with the next Xbox but
