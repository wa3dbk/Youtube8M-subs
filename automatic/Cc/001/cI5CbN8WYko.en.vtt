00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.629
 the red bull x-alps are coming up 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.020
 Germany has for the first time four starter on 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.060
 start a missing michael gebert here 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.400
 is yvonne dathe successful 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.519
 competitor third of the em and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.410
 team world champion Manuel NÃ¼bel from whole 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.359
 successful competition pilot and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.830
 sebastian huber sebastian has the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.869
 won boardercross 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 that's basically a heike frey as well 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.220
 become a competition 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.780
 How do you prepare yourself for that? 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.970
 compete for yourself 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.530
 So I have a training plan now 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.450
 In order to train it after I just 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 run out trainier also just times 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.090
 Weight training and flying naturally 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.980
 My, what about you? 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.230
 are you doing fly anyway? 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.220
 many worldcup now have many at the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.950
 worked condition 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.920
 in the end the main work consists 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.020
 My legs are in my condition 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 musculature and longing and everything up 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.320
 to bring forward that one for it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.370
 just well prepared and what also 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.770
 a big point is just the whole 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.390
 Organization because I think that too 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 very important is that you have the route 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070
 planned and other things like sponsors 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.960
 Acquisition and other stuff you can do in the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.540
 vorfeld still must clarify take 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 also a lot of time right now 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 now a special preparation house 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 basti tricky flyers made what you need 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.360
 learn now especially 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.170
 dealing with the media so the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.790
 Preparations are actually going well 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.490
 the sponsors of the everything went well 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.770
 I am very happy 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.540
 and what immediately concerns the training 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.710
 physically and aviator must yes 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.960
 nothing to change that 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.820
 major advantage 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.170
 Over and until now only a few have 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.240
 women at the red bull x-alps 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 took part 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 what are your chances and what are your chances? 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.880
 what disadvantages do you see towards the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.590
 male competitors so the biggest 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360
 disadvantage because I just see it from 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.369
 swim because it's easy for 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 my weight range little mold 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.700
 are the ones I select from 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.770
 can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 in the endurance area , I see it now 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.040
 not so big disadvantages because there is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.840
 quite studies prove that just 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.850
 Women in the endurance area well 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 can bring good services and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.650
 which chance no longer calculate so 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.090
 I think everything is possible 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.100
 the most important thing is that I am healthy 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.220
 come back and best 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.140
 of course, arrive in monaco healthy 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.850
 you already said you are flying 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500
 successful competition what for 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.890
 challenge special to the chair now 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.320
 in the x-alps soul so a bit 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.440
 challenge me to prove it myself 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.780
 that I then stick to it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.570
 to raise such a big project 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.960
 am also i am otherwise shining 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.580
 I'm just the type 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.290
 life is easy to hold everything a bit 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.640
 take it easy and time for such a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.010
 big project takes time damn 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.210
 a lot of bite and a lot of discipline and me 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400
 believe me that too in my 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.959
 rest life would do just fine if 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.660
 I just learn to do that and I'm already 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.720
 quite well and thereby 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.020
 what chances do you expect? 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.340
 to come to Monaco was you are in 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.260
 Get masons in the team with the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 three times this advantage or winner 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.990
 disadvantage 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.030
 since sat as a joy on the move as 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.209
 competitors so first of all to say that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.380
 They understand the rule very well 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.989
 not just now because it just has 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.600
 clashed by red bull x-alps 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.890
 but are on a human 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.470
 page ago it has definitely beneficial 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.580
 for me from the experiences of 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.070
 to learn to citizens and we see that 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.480
 both media hardly ever compete 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.230
 but rather simply as an adventure 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.470
 shot something is yours 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.060
 personal goal is prone to self 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.590
 not to hurt yourself and so fast 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.900
 as possible to come to monaco 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.209
 christoph weber race director of the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.040
 red bull x-alps christoph have this 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.550
 her nominated for German as it comes 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.290
 years before that it was not so high, the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.269
 Years ago you do not have that many 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.680
 Applications from Germany and before 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.989
 not very promising either 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.440
 Applications from Germany like this 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.199
 times 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.210
 So that's why people are just good people 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.699
 who have applied interesting 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.800
 faces a woman while doing so 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.620
 a German which I am particularly pleased 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.229
 and it's just constellations like 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.270
 they were not there the years before 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.930
 what's new in the red bull 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.910
 So x-fighters are sending new ones 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 all the same many new faces like 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.020
 just said extra too 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.760
 different clothes for people who 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.100
 have already participated 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.910
 Compared to those the first time 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.830
 to be there 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.050
 so you will be immediately on the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 picture or when they come over 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.490
 recognize the clothes 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.490
 New is also the distance have to be 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.139
 start another route and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.360
 the same goal remains the same 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.970
 stretch in between will be new 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.260
 the route will be here now 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.760
 not announced 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.410
 this announcement is on 17 march 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.120
 I think many wait quite a lot 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.729
 looking forward to it for a stretch 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.669
 I will betray you to the track 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.919
 already she will touch germany 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.750
 with guide through Germany 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.729
 and of course it fits especially well 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.330
 together with the many Germans 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.330
 participants
