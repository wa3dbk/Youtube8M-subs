00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 good morning after two days notice that in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.290
 playa del carmen there is a diver who 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.880
 known as the pain chin since it makes 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.440
 years realized that in front of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 Playa del Carmen arrived a group of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.839
 sharks bull females kiss to dive with 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.750
 them later to feed them and now 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 takes many tourists becoming 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.109
 part of the economic activity in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 Playa del Carmen but it is impressive 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.050
 how do you feed them these 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.850
 sharks without safety measures what 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.970
 reason you know 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.110
 Y 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.890
 we know it as the Chinese loria 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 some believe he is crazy 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 they are fascinated by sharks 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.260
 go down to the seabed to give them 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260
 eat 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.150
 15 years ago during a dive Jorge the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 Oria Belt discovered that a group of 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.820
 bull sharks arrives in front of playa del 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.640
 carmen quintana roo 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.160
 they were very fat tribunes they were 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.739
 pregnant then we believe that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.500
 come near areas to have their 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.540
 offspring 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.240
 the beach divers del carmen were given 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.130
 account that between 15 and 20 females arrive 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.050
 in the month of November and they retire in 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 March 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.790
 the pain has already started to bring tourists 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.080
 looking for extreme experiences up 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 the area where the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 bull sharks 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.990
 it's a sport it 's a is starting to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 do right now is really interesting the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.270
 sharks are not as dangerous as 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 people think but if we should take 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.810
 certain security measures because the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.030
 we are bringing with weights 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 invited us to dive to record as 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.049
 feed the sharks without 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.120
 steel cage protection only 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.100
 use a mesh 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.260
 the dress code is very 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 important of three dark colors nothing 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.830
 Contrast does not move the hands much 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 beware of cameras 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 give us some recommendations 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.979
 of what diving is, how are we going to get off 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.130
 how are we going to behave and that's when 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.049
 we started swallowing the sharks the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 smell already checked his equipment and started to 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.519
 descend carrying a container 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.360
 Inside, there were pieces of fish 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.520
 and blood 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 we come to the place where he usually 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.430
 feed them 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.590
 It is located half a kilometer from the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.739
 coast at a depth of 24 meters 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.360
 on the seabed there is a rope 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.170
 we must hold on to it and keep 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.150
 without making sudden movements 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.140
 the chinese loria opened the container and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.099
 started to take the fish out the blood 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.099
 immediately attracted sharks 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.069
 the observation lasted 20 minutes we had to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 the view a few meters to this 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.420
 species that can measure almost 4 meters 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.420
 long and weigh up to 350 kilos 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.840
 4 meters deep and is a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.830
 unforgettable experience to be with this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.870
 huge 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 if you have a very important risk but 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.220
 as I tell you things well taken 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 can be done and if it is extremely 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.200
 important to regulate the activity there 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.190
 many places or a link for example 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.310
 in juba in fiji in bahamas but always 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.310
 rules to be diving this activity 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.750
 took rise in Playa del Carmen several 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.160
 dive companies promote the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.800
 observation of bull shark 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.480
 in general the different species of 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.270
 shark face a crisis because of 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.460
 overfishing the Asian market promotes 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.470
 predation encouraging the purchase of 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.230
 the fins under the argument that they are 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.440
 aphrodisiacs 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.299
 and the experience of the providers of 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.430
 service at playa del carmen demonstrates 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.430
 that is worth more a shark alive than dead 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.250
 city 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.250
 I 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.700
 and they went up to the floors of the building 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.030
 difficult in your email we use the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.989
 top visitors 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.180
 specific 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.330
 because we will 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.260
 mexico and his analysis let loose 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.920
 defense of you in the desert bag blinding 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.920
 10 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.360
 his observation attracts tourists who 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.570
 they make an important spill 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.830
 economic in lodging food 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.990
 transport equipment rental and guides 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.850
 without forgetting that its conservation of this 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.590
 great predator is important for the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.650
 food chain in the seas and 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.650
 oceans 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.440
 it's not incredible incredible it was a 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.730
 very father experience this heat that the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.730
 sharks at that moment get excited 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.170
 there was not much breathing for there to be 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.700
 many bubbles do so many 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.650
 movements but that being there is a 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.200
 incredible experience with those animals 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.610
 and what they explained to me to have an animal 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.880
 of these alive I get to him every year 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.690
 feeds the hotel operator to the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.790
 guide to this from the boat the Alcazar 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.140
 besides a live shark that one married 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.700
