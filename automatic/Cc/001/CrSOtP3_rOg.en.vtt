little bit more work than the last video
I've<00:00:14.560> set<00:00:14.830> up<00:00:15.090> some<00:00:16.090> effect<00:00:16.390> bank<00:00:16.600> so<00:00:16.810> what

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
I've set up some effect bank so what

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.300 
I've set up some effect bank so what
I've<00:00:17.080> got<00:00:17.230> here<00:00:17.260> is<00:00:17.470> a<00:00:17.590> basic<00:00:17.890> arrangement

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
I've got here is a basic arrangement

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.000 
I've got here is a basic arrangement
going<00:00:18.700> I've<00:00:19.090> got<00:00:19.660> our<00:00:19.900> two<00:00:20.380> tracks<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.800> beats

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
going I've got our two tracks of beats

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.470 
going I've got our two tracks of beats
that<00:00:21.520> one<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.740> d55<00:00:24.520> kit<00:00:24.880> just<00:00:25.210> able<00:00:25.390> to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
that one from the d55 kit just able to

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.930 
that one from the d55 kit just able to
build<00:00:25.780> Inc<00:00:25.960> it<00:00:26.170> and<00:00:26.350> I've<00:00:26.500> got<00:00:26.710> a<00:00:26.949> reactor<00:00:27.789> come

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
build Inc it and I've got a reactor come

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.769 
build Inc it and I've got a reactor come
and<00:00:28.030> kick<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:30.130> were<00:00:31.029> going<00:00:31.300> for<00:00:31.449> a<00:00:31.510> sub<00:00:31.750> group

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
and kick they were going for a sub group

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.069 
and kick they were going for a sub group
which<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.529> channel<00:00:32.800> for<00:00:33.039> their<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:34.510> channel<00:00:34.870> 4

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
which is channel for their in channel 4

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.579 
which is channel for their in channel 4
i've<00:00:35.289> got<00:00:35.559> my<00:00:35.980> dfx<00:00:36.850> afro<00:00:37.269> variety<00:00:37.870> of<00:00:37.960> faithful

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
i've got my dfx afro variety of faithful

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.099 
i've got my dfx afro variety of faithful
and<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:39.489> growing<00:00:39.729> delay<00:00:40.030> just<00:00:40.269> standard<00:00:40.899> stuff

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
and a growing delay just standard stuff

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.439 
and a growing delay just standard stuff
so<00:00:41.499> i'm<00:00:41.829> going<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.010> do<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.129> map<00:00:42.449> concrete

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
so i'm going to do is map concrete

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.819 
so i'm going to do is map concrete
performance<00:00:43.839> of<00:00:43.929> various<00:00:44.019> elements<00:00:44.440> there

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
performance of various elements there

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.169 
performance of various elements there
and<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:46.629> our<00:00:46.719> glitch<00:00:46.989> on<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.800> i'm<00:00:48.179> dropping

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
and get our glitch on so i'm dropping

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.899 
and get our glitch on so i'm dropping
down<00:00:49.269> to<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.479> concrete<00:00:49.719> form<00:00:50.050> itself<00:00:50.909> basically

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
down to a concrete form itself basically

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.669 
down to a concrete form itself basically
it's<00:00:52.479> just<00:00:52.569> the<00:00:52.929> same<00:00:53.139> mapping<00:00:53.319> not<00:00:53.530> shown

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
it's just the same mapping not shown

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.649 
it's just the same mapping not shown
last<00:00:53.829> time<00:00:54.129> but<00:00:54.489> um<00:00:54.699> it's<00:00:55.210> covered<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.510> few

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
last time but um it's covered a few

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.199 
last time but um it's covered a few
extra<00:00:55.960> little<00:00:56.289> things<00:00:56.499> so<00:00:56.799> if<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.100> am<00:00:57.280> take

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:58.209 
extra little things so if I am take

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.229 
extra little things so if I am take
control<00:00:58.690> one<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.399> did<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.789> going<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.089> map

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
control one and did that going to map

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.619 
control one and did that going to map
over<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.749> DFCS<00:01:02.129> buffer<00:01:03.129> override<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.089> couple

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
over to DFCS buffer override so a couple

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.749 
over to DFCS buffer override so a couple
of<00:01:04.780> things<00:01:04.839> I've<00:01:05.079> done<00:01:05.110> here<00:01:05.469> till<00:01:06.369> now<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:06.729> a

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
of things I've done here till now for a

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.840 
of things I've done here till now for a
second<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.860> little<00:01:08.979> button<00:01:09.189> just<00:01:09.729> here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
second there's a little button just here

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.950 
second there's a little button just here
which<00:01:10.659> tunes<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.990> CC<00:01:11.439> over<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.329> Ableton<00:01:13.329> so<00:01:13.659> in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
which tunes the CC over to Ableton so in

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.800 
which tunes the CC over to Ableton so in
Ableton<00:01:14.560> here<00:01:14.740> febs<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.310> row<00:01:15.520> right<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.570> click

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
Ableton here febs of row right and click

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.429 
Ableton here febs of row right and click
on<00:01:17.049> earth<00:01:17.920> divisor<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:19.020> i'll<00:01:20.020> just<00:01:20.200> give

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
on earth divisor and i'll just give

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.760 
on earth divisor and i'll just give
expose<00:01:21.780> click<00:01:22.780> up<00:01:22.960> there<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.409> you'll<00:01:23.560> see

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
expose click up there and you'll see

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.770 
expose click up there and you'll see
them<00:01:23.950> immediately<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:25.060> mapped<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.600> up

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
them immediately that's mapped it up

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.190 
them immediately that's mapped it up
there<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.950> same<00:01:27.310> thing

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
there so same thing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.279 
there so same thing
let's<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:30.259> upsize<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.390> we'll<00:01:33.719> stick<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
let's go to upsize and we'll stick that

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.450 
let's go to upsize and we'll stick that
there<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.390> finally<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.950> dry<00:01:38.189> wet

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there and then finally on the dry wet

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
there and then finally on the dry wet
mix<00:01:38.789> so<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.929> always<00:01:40.170> full<00:01:40.679> on<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:41.159> going

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
mix so it's not always full on I'm going

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.169 
mix so it's not always full on I'm going
to<00:01:41.369> map<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> length<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.850> Maps

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
to map it over to the length now as Maps

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.139 
to map it over to the length now as Maps
has<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.539> yet<00:01:45.689> good<00:01:46.069> right<00:01:47.069> so<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> medium

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
has not yet good right so now a medium

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.480 
has not yet good right so now a medium
if<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> click<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.659> begin<00:01:49.819> you'll<00:01:50.819> see<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.210> here

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
if I click this begin you'll see on here

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.100 
if I click this begin you'll see on here
but<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.640> controlling<00:01:55.069> these<00:01:56.069> two<00:01:56.490> elements

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
but I'm controlling these two elements

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.990 
but I'm controlling these two elements
but<00:01:58.110> also<00:01:58.319> that<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> length<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.520> am<00:01:59.759> away<00:01:59.969> from

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
but also that the length i am away from

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.899 
but also that the length i am away from
that<00:02:00.299> central<00:02:00.689> node<00:02:01.159> makes<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:02.340> dry<00:02:02.549> wet<00:02:02.729> mix

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that central node makes my dry wet mix

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.380 
that central node makes my dry wet mix
move<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.080> if<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.200> move<00:02:04.319> it<00:02:04.470> down<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.970> it's<00:02:05.970> full

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
move so if i move it down here it's full

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.150 
move so if i move it down here it's full
on<00:02:06.420> wet<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.079> i<00:02:07.170> move<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> node<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
on wet if i move it up to the node it's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420 
on wet if i move it up to the node it's
dry<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.119> effected<00:02:09.720> affected<00:02:10.430> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
dry so it will not effected affected and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.370 
dry so it will not effected affected and
then<00:02:11.519> there's<00:02:11.700> my<00:02:11.760> usual<00:02:12.150> buffer<00:02:12.420> stuff<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
then there's my usual buffer stuff so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.199 
then there's my usual buffer stuff so
that's<00:02:13.470> quite<00:02:13.650> nice<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.489> some<00:02:14.549> nice

that's quite nice so I can get some nice

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.309 
that's quite nice so I can get some nice
little<00:02:15.480> patni<00:02:16.440> stuff<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:17.549> there<00:02:18.319> okay

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.580 
so I'm you should do the same thing with
rain<00:02:21.060> delay<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:22.349> take<00:02:22.500> note<00:02:22.739> number<00:02:22.950> two

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
rain delay so let's take note number two

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.059 
rain delay so let's take note number two
again<00:02:25.590> apologies<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.280> shaky<00:02:26.489> cam<00:02:27.890> alright<00:02:28.890> so

again apologies for shaky cam alright so
on<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> brain<00:02:29.610> delay<00:02:29.940> i'm<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.390> map

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
on the brain delay i'm going to map

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.960 
on the brain delay i'm going to map
frequency<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.750> expose

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
frequency to expose

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.090 
frequency to expose
and<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:39.170> pitch<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.940> white<00:02:42.870> horse<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.770> sent<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and go pitch to white horse just sent it

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.460 
and go pitch to white horse just sent it
over<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.120> again<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.380> do

over like that and again I'm going to do
the<00:02:46.560> same<00:02:46.800> thing<00:02:47.280> with<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.580> dry<00:02:47.940> wet<00:02:48.240> mix<00:02:48.510> ah

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the same thing with the dry wet mix ah

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.060 
the same thing with the dry wet mix ah
sorry<00:02:50.820> dry<00:02:51.630> wet<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.800> I'm<00:02:53.130> going<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> turn<00:02:53.610> on

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
sorry dry wet and I'm going to turn on

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.460 
sorry dry wet and I'm going to turn on
what's<00:02:56.070> your<00:02:56.220> name<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.640> length<00:02:57.350> send<00:02:58.350> that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
what's your name so length send that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
what's your name so length send that
over<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> length<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.890> mix<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.310> well

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
over so length is now mix it too as well

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.880 
over so length is now mix it too as well
so<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.090> lot<00:03:03.180> midi<00:03:03.420> mapping<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.590> now

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
so it's a lot midi mapping and now

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.140 
so it's a lot midi mapping and now
you'll<00:03:05.100> see<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> same<00:03:05.520> thing<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.060> happening

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you'll see the same thing is happening

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.290 
you'll see the same thing is happening
with<00:03:06.600> number<00:03:07.140> two<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:08.490> my<00:03:08.640> dry<00:03:08.820> wit<00:03:08.970> mix<00:03:09.120> is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
with number two so my dry wit mix is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.199 
with number two so my dry wit mix is
there<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.280> migraine<00:03:11.280> delay<00:03:11.610> has<00:03:11.970> been

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
there and migraine delay has been

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.400 
there and migraine delay has been
controlled<00:03:12.660> by<00:03:13.580> x<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.790> y<00:03:14.910> position<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:16.380> that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
controlled by x and y position so that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.690 
controlled by x and y position so that
thing<00:03:16.740> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> length<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.670> really

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
thing of the length is a really really

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.510 
thing of the length is a really really
useful<00:03:18.440> thing<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.590> what<00:03:19.740> happens<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.340> then

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
useful thing and what happens is then

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.060 
useful thing and what happens is then
when<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> control<00:03:21.090> both<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.780> get<00:03:22.709> these<00:03:22.830> really

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
when I control both I get these really

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.520 
when I control both I get these really
nice<00:03:24.470> sweeps<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> if<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:27.840> point<00:03:28.170> up<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
nice sweeps so if I just point up to the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.310 
nice sweeps so if I just point up to the
effects<00:03:28.860> you'll<00:03:29.100> see<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:30.110> something<00:03:31.110> up

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
effects you'll see this something up

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.990 
effects you'll see this something up
here<00:03:31.500> hopefully<00:03:31.950> with<00:03:32.250> both<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.459> them

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
here hopefully with both of them

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.580 
here hopefully with both of them
as<00:03:34.360> I'm<00:03:34.630> ever<00:03:34.750> around<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.720> then<00:03:41.050> as<00:03:41.200> before

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
as I'm ever around so then as before

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.910 
as I'm ever around so then as before
we've<00:03:41.980> got<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> little<00:03:42.370> preset<00:03:42.820> positions<00:03:42.970> here

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
we've got a little preset positions here

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.310 
we've got a little preset positions here
which<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.100> can<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:45.480> set<00:03:46.480> quite<00:03:46.690> easily<00:03:46.930> and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
which you can just set quite easily and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.790 
which you can just set quite easily and
I've<00:03:48.040> got<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> couple<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.640> like<00:03:48.760> safe<00:03:49.060> positions

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
I've got a couple of like safe positions

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.410 
I've got a couple of like safe positions
so<00:03:50.800> this<00:03:50.980> for<00:03:51.160> instance<00:03:51.220> because<00:03:51.970> they're

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
so this for instance because they're

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.990 
so this for instance because they're
right<00:03:52.840> next<00:03:52.990> to<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.200> central<00:03:53.680> node<00:03:54.000> sorry

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
right next to that central node sorry

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.780 
right next to that central node sorry
actually<00:03:55.270> want<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.750> any<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.020> be<00:03:56.110> 12<00:03:56.530> done

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
actually want to for any to be 12 done

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.420 
actually want to for any to be 12 done
so<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:57.850> i<00:03:57.940> move<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.150> up<00:03:58.540> there<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:58.870> well<00:03:59.430> that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
so if i move to up there as well that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.390 
so if i move to up there as well that
should<00:04:00.640> be<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> fairly<00:04:00.940> safe<00:04:01.300> position<00:04:02.400> let's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
should be a fairly safe position let's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.180 
should be a fairly safe position let's
just<00:04:03.459> move<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.880> whole<00:04:04.030> thing<00:04:04.300> over<00:04:05.190> here

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
just move the whole thing over here

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.250 
just move the whole thing over here
there<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.700> go<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.660> I'll<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.750> programmer

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
there you go so I'll just programmer

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.890 
there you go so I'll just programmer
into<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:09.100> bottom<00:04:09.400> one<00:04:09.550> so<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.570> know<00:04:10.660> that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
into that bottom one so I know that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.600 
into that bottom one so I know that
whenever<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.500> need<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.950> get<00:04:12.040> back<00:04:12.190> there<00:04:12.370> and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
whenever I need to get back there and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.100 
whenever I need to get back there and
just<00:04:12.760> hit<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.060> one<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.390> it'll<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.989> fairly

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
just hit that one and it'll be fairly

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.740 
just hit that one and it'll be fairly
safe<00:04:15.030> clicking<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> cake<00:04:16.299> drum<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.600> you'll

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
safe clicking the cake drum and you'll

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.620 
safe clicking the cake drum and you'll
find<00:04:23.730> I've<00:04:24.730> got<00:04:24.940> some<00:04:25.090> really<00:04:25.240> nice<00:04:25.390> little

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
find I've got some really nice little

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.320 
find I've got some really nice little
kind<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.870> bitchy<00:04:28.860> patterns<00:04:30.150> increase<00:04:31.150> the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
kind of bitchy patterns increase the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.990 
kind of bitchy patterns increase the
inertia<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:34.060> these<00:04:34.210> really<00:04:34.570> nice

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
inertia and get these really nice
