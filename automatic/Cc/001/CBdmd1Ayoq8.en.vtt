00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 Airplanes connect the people 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.790
 our globe is for business or business 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 a holiday trip 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.769
 but in the sky the competition of the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 airlines for turbulent times 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.650
 modern aircraft can do this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.179
 be decisive joker 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.369
 Germany's largest airline 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.990
 is therefore the most comprehensive 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.869
 brisk renewal of their almost 90-year-olds 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 history 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.890
 we currently have nearly 300 new ones 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 planes ordered by the year 2025 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.369
 be delivered 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 the total investment amount 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 list price and 36 billion euros 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 So a gigantic sum for one 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 private company alone the order of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.320
 new long-haul aircraft is considered 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 largest single investment of a German 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 company of all times 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
 we can get the orders from the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.950
 new jumbo variant of the boeing 747 800 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.079
 about the airbus a 350 it does not yet 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.170
 in the air traffic gives up to the new 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 boeing triple same model 9x that still 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.039
 not built at all 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.520
 on the short haul is scheduled for 2016 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.199
 all the a 320 neo fly 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 Overall, the new generations 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.240
 of course our aerodynamics 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.659
 much more sophisticated than even a few years ago 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.330
 decades the engines are newest 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.780
 technology essential 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 fuel-efficient with it too 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 In fact, low emission consumed 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 a new plane on average pro 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 seat 25 less kerosene than one 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.340
 older the environment can so breathe 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 but also the residents of frankfurter 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.850
 airport at lufthansa at home 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 become the advantages of the new fleet 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 clearly feel of modern aircraft 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 also benefits our surrounding modern 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 aircraft generally quieter 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 You can fly as old planes 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 we're talking about reductions here 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.310
 the so-called emissions so the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.909
 Sound the noise of a plane 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 caused from about 30 to 40 and 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.299
 Finally, for the airport operator 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.969
 Of course it is also more pleasant with 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 modern planes are working in 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.710
 usually less prone to failure than old ones 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.290
 machinery 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.390
 the airport is happy about the brigades 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.130
 renewal and sets by lower 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 pay for quieter machines already 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.790
 longer inducement for a change 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.319
 Lufthansa is limited 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.600
 Fleet renewal not only on the 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.230
 passage was also at the freight 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.390
 changed direction 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.970
 we are more and more state of the art triple 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 Seven asked instead of the louder MD-11 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 in use 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.680
 All new machines are for the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:34.450
 airline important signpost direction 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:36.130
 the future of Lufthansa our own 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.709
 self-confidence and we think that we 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.970
 with it a renewal of our 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.190
 Fleet can do it to us 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.239
 will be confident in the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.680
 to look to the future and the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.090
 challenges of more and more 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.450
 also consist nascent competition to 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.880
 can 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.810
 the passengers are allowed in every case 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.120
 to be excited 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.800
 the new flight feeling in state-of-the-art 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.800
