00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 title sounds strong but she with the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.040
 years has learned to understand it so a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.840
 survivor already participated in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 years since the accident in these five 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 years has always been a constant pain 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 but with the help of my family and the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 support of the priests of the school and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 of the school itself is that way that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 this pain transfer it to a hope to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 a hope that moves us all 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.489
 that we have survived this accident 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.300
 He knows people too and hear from you 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 is going to be even better the relationship and the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.809
 remember and the company that you have 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 delivered to the bus driver has given 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 lions that are reading for 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.090

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.949
 a great companion for us who

 He has always supported us in everything and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 we have also supported in 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.590
 all its in all its ups and downs that has 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.270
 had during the time that in these 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.690
 five years that we've had this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.690
 tragedy 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.600
 we explain for people for the common 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.159
 from the people who watch television to this 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.080
 time for those who do not know what has 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.240
 meaning this accident because there is no 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.130
 rage because there is no remorse like 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 they handle that as how they have worked that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 situation 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.549
 there is no or anger for a simple reason 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 that was an accident and accidents 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.409
 happen and everything goes through something and that's a 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 construction that they took out over time 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 in the first moment that happened because 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.940
 this was on the bus you talked to me 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.619
 off camera in what was that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.299
 impact the overturning 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.850
 then the conversations what they lived 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.680
 in those hours if we have taken it out 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.039

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.630

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 Leo's fault but an accident and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.390

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.789
 family said what is your testimony 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.409

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.610
 precisely that you were and that 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.450
 you were very close to death 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.180
 in 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.649

 strength because it 's weakness 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.870
 I understand what happens up to a few years and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.349
 be able to board a bus without being able to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.299
 quiet yes or because the fear of returning 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.010
 to get on a bus was always after 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.849
 of the accident but over time what 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.170
