00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
see it looks much better now

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.860 
see it looks much better now
a<00:02:24.110> few<00:02:25.040> tutorials<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.730> watch<00:02:26.000> they<00:02:26.239> said<00:02:26.569> in

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
a few tutorials I watch they said in

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.740 
a few tutorials I watch they said in
order<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.830> they<00:02:28.370> called<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:28.790> curing<00:02:29.299> to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
order to they called it like curing to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.809 
order to they called it like curing to
cure<00:02:29.989> them<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> guess<00:02:30.620> which<00:02:30.980> makes<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.610> like

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
cure them I guess which makes it like

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.800 
cure them I guess which makes it like
fully<00:02:32.450> fully<00:02:32.840> dry<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.860> take<00:02:34.099> like<00:02:34.280> 20<00:02:34.580> days

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
fully fully dry it can take like 20 days

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.080 
fully fully dry it can take like 20 days
and<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:36.019> way<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:37.250> speed<00:02:37.790> up<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.030> process

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and a way to like speed up that process

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.140 
and a way to like speed up that process
is<00:02:38.599> by<00:02:38.720> sticking<00:02:39.019> them<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.890> oven<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.970> I'm

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
is by sticking them in the oven so I'm

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.550 
is by sticking them in the oven so I'm
gonna<00:02:41.299> go<00:02:41.360> ahead<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.510> try<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.959> hopefully<00:02:42.470> it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
gonna go ahead and try that hopefully it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.869 
gonna go ahead and try that hopefully it
works<00:02:42.739> okay<00:02:43.069> you're<00:02:43.220> supposed<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.579> put<00:02:43.790> them

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
works okay you're supposed to put them

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.630 
works okay you're supposed to put them
in<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> oven<00:02:44.299> while<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.959> still<00:02:45.260> cold<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
in the oven while it's still cold and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300 
in the oven while it's still cold and
then<00:02:46.790> let<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.660> warm<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.260> 350<00:02:48.890> degrees<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
then let it warm up to 350 degrees and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.100 
then let it warm up to 350 degrees and
once<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:49.940> once<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.810> gets<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.019> that

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
once it's once it gets to that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.920 
once it's once it gets to that
temperature<00:02:51.530> let<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.010> run<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.760> 30<00:02:53.480> minutes

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
temperature let it run for 30 minutes

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
temperature let it run for 30 minutes
and<00:02:54.140> then<00:02:54.200> turn<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:54.440> back<00:02:54.500> off<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:54.890> wait<00:02:55.129> for

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
and then turn it back off and wait for

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.300 
and then turn it back off and wait for
them<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.489> completely<00:02:55.940> cool<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.599> then<00:02:57.310> they'll

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
them to completely cool and then they'll

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.000 
them to completely cool and then they'll
be<00:02:58.519> ready<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.180> start<00:02:59.599> sanding<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.620> we're<00:03:00.920> gonna
