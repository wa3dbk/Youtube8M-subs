00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.559
 have the car under the teeth 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.540
 armed with security system 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 Location system gps tracker gsm pager 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.970
 continue pager in the new shock system 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.470
 Sensor modules glass break sensor digital 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.360
 tilt sensor and even more lures 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.780
 in addition you take the theme pretty much 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 seriously, however, is in Hamburg 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.280
 Here he stands on the theft 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.420
 number one and that has me to it 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.610
 moved that I just need to take care 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 this my bulli not cleared up right away 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.750
 Will you ever be a bad one? 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.039
 experience or because I know how 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.090
 we talked about it 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.619
 the system and I said I have 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 pretty long lead times right now 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 was it a little bit restless? 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.080
 Yes that's true 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 Of course I got nervous because 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 the longer it takes i have got it now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 relatively longer the car the longer 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.790
 It lasts for me, of course 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 the more nervous I get it is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 Of course not so pleasant and we 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.909
 have mine in the family 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.259
 sister has bought in beefy he is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 after three months after they had 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.369
 so he was just rebuilt and then 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 have him right outside the front door 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.860
 stolen 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.939
 that was also a transporter 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 rebuilt as california and that got me 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.479
 Stop moving as fast as possible 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 if I bulls to then must 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 security 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.290
 that's fine, you have really 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 done it all 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.950
 I said yes to you if you have the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 alarm system is not necessary now 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 absolutely a blogger still have and still 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 another emergency generator once again 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 a second power supply for the gps 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.299
 how does that happen? 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.269
 security fanatic yes it is 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.890
 because that yes with a system 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.120
 maybe it drives quite well but it is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.530
 of course, if you bridge that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.019
 Of course you have to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 In a sense, make sure you do that 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.360
 as difficult as possible makes a couple 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.510
 create redundancies 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.770
 that means of course I want to be through the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.870
 alarm system that she did not even go to 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.819
 Car come in 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.650
 that's natural as soon as possible 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.299
 informed if something 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.030
 I do not want to come in when she comes in 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.769
 that I get yes that's a few 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.629
 mechanical systems security systems 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.099
 Trainer and I would like to ask him 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.890
 of course, see again and there is 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.209
 of course the gps tracking because of that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.829
 right and you can then of course 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 also to some extent clues of 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.579
 Submit police as fast as 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.140
 possible that means that you dare 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.269
 Again, it looks as if you're getting a chance 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.040
 bigger and that is well spent money 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.150
 definitely yes i think i can 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.620
 I have been calming down for 20 years 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.610
 years here never vehicle loss 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.900
 have not even had one 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.650
 break-in attempt by the cyclist with 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.030
 pool is already a certain 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.769
 Prevention when someone gets to the vehicle 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.450
 there is already a diet now 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.370
 warning so i think you can 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.239
 now really quiet sleep anyway 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.370
 thank you and yes I welcome you or 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.049
 I say goodbye and see you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.319
 Thanks a lot on a youtube channel 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.319
