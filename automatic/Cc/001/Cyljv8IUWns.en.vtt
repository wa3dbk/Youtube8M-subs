00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
gameplay of Assassin's Creed 3 on the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.310 
gameplay of Assassin's Creed 3 on the
AMD<00:00:07.830> a4<00:00:08.429> 3,300<00:00:09.590> APU<00:00:11.599> as<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> game

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
AMD a4 3,300 APU as you can see the game

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.420 
AMD a4 3,300 APU as you can see the game
is<00:00:13.500> running<00:00:13.650> quite<00:00:14.040> slowly<00:00:16.039> for<00:00:17.039> me<00:00:17.130> due<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
is running quite slowly for me due to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340 
is running quite slowly for me due to
the<00:00:17.520> integrated<00:00:18.029> graphics<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.140> using

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the integrated graphics as I'm not using

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.140 
the integrated graphics as I'm not using
any<00:00:19.770> other<00:00:20.010> graphics<00:00:20.520> card<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.060> this

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
any other graphics card with this

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
any other graphics card with this
processor<00:00:21.840> I'll<00:00:22.560> show<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> settings

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
processor I'll show you the settings

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.650 
processor I'll show you the settings
here<00:00:23.789> quickly<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.000> running<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.420> all

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
here quickly I think it's running on all

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
here quickly I think it's running on all
low<00:00:30.960> settings<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.320> normal<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
low settings so your normal which is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.540 
low settings so your normal which is
equivalent<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.820> console<00:00:36.450> settings<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.079> think

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
equivalent to console settings I think

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.360 
equivalent to console settings I think
so<00:00:38.550> yeah<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> moment<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.129> sure<00:00:41.280> if

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so yeah at the moment I'm not sure if

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.690 
so yeah at the moment I'm not sure if
this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> Boston

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
this is just because I'm in Boston

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
this is just because I'm in Boston
because<00:00:44.700> I've<00:00:44.940> read<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.860> on<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because I've read a lot of things on the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
because I've read a lot of things on the
internet<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> says<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.050> lag<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.559> occurs

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
internet that says all the lag it occurs

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.369 
internet that says all the lag it occurs
in<00:00:50.190> Boston<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:52.050> any<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
in Boston so I don't know if in any of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.060 
in Boston so I don't know if in any of
the<00:00:52.469> other<00:00:52.590> cities<00:00:54.379> I'd<00:00:55.379> see<00:00:55.649> an<00:00:55.710> improvement

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the other cities I'd see an improvement

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
the other cities I'd see an improvement
in<00:00:56.309> frame<00:00:56.579> rates<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.710> here<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.859> getting

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
in frame rates but here I'm getting

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.529 
in frame rates but here I'm getting
about<00:00:59.280> between<00:00:59.730> 10<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.270> 15<00:01:01.020> sometimes<00:01:01.649> 20

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
about between 10 and 15 sometimes 20

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
about between 10 and 15 sometimes 20
depending<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.920> I'm

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
depending on where I'm go where I'm

was<00:01:26.050> any<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.620> PC<00:01:27.190> version<00:01:27.610> actually<00:01:28.150> but<00:01:29.490> yeah

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
was any the PC version actually but yeah

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.360 
was any the PC version actually but yeah
max<00:01:30.760> frame<00:01:30.970> rates<00:01:31.210> about<00:01:31.390> 25<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.350> minimum<00:01:33.040> is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
max frame rates about 25 and minimum is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.080 
max frame rates about 25 and minimum is
about<00:01:33.640> 10<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.770> I'm<00:01:35.860> not<00:01:36.010> sure<00:01:36.280> like<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:36.790> say

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
about 10 but I'm not sure like I say

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.820 
about 10 but I'm not sure like I say
that<00:01:37.120> will<00:01:37.510> improve<00:01:39.540> after<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.750> gal<00:01:41.170> Boston<00:01:41.830> or
