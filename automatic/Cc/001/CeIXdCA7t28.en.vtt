00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.070 
that obtainment put it inside out or
outside<00:03:38.740> in<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.010> guess<00:03:39.220> we<00:03:39.460> would<00:03:39.610> say<00:03:39.960> it's<00:03:40.960> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
outside in I guess we would say it's the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.800 
outside in I guess we would say it's the
correct<00:03:41.320> way<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.530> put<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.850> then<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.420> unzip

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
correct way to put it and then you unzip

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.280 
correct way to put it and then you unzip
it<00:03:43.960> and<00:03:44.080> then<00:03:44.200> it's<00:03:44.440> really<00:03:44.650> easy

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290
