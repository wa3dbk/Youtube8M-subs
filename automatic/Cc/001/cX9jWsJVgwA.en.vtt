00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.740 
on behalf of expert village in this clip
we're<00:00:04.589> going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.830> talk<00:00:05.100> briefly<00:00:05.370> about

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
we're going to talk briefly about

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.330 
we're going to talk briefly about
microphone<00:00:06.750> placement<00:00:07.140> we're<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
microphone placement we're going to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
microphone placement we're going to
cover<00:00:08.550> using<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.960> two<00:00:10.530> most<00:00:10.800> commonly<00:00:12.049> used

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
cover using the two most commonly used

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
cover using the two most commonly used
types<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.500> microphones<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.790> live

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
types of microphones in the live

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.820 
types of microphones in the live
environment<00:00:16.850> but<00:00:17.850> remember<00:00:18.650> there's<00:00:19.650> lots

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
environment but remember there's lots

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.080 
environment but remember there's lots
and<00:00:19.920> lots<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.189> choices<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.820> read<00:00:20.939> your

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and lots of choices and read your

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
and lots of choices and read your
specifications<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:21.990> experiment<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.519> let's

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
specifications and experiment but let's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.599 
specifications and experiment but let's
assume<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> typical<00:00:25.609> microphone

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
assume now this is a typical microphone

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.790 
assume now this is a typical microphone
that<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.910> would<00:00:27.060> use<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.470> make<00:00:28.470> guitar

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that we would use to make guitar

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.020 
that we would use to make guitar
cabinets<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.670> forth<00:00:30.050> snare<00:00:31.050> drum<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
cabinets and so forth snare drum and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.220 
cabinets and so forth snare drum and
those<00:00:33.030> types<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> things<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.780> let's<00:00:33.960> assume

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
those types of things now let's assume

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160 
those types of things now let's assume
that<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.620> speaker<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:36.170> guitar

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that this speaker is actually a guitar

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.030 
that this speaker is actually a guitar
cabinet<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.170> here's<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> speaker<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
cabinet you see here's the speaker you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880 
cabinet you see here's the speaker you
can<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> video<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.899> as

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
can kind of see that in the video now as

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.520 
can kind of see that in the video now as
you<00:00:44.730> move<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.920> set<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.160> microphone

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
you move and set your microphone

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
you move and set your microphone
throughout<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.860> range<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.059> speaker<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
throughout the range of the speaker the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
throughout the range of the speaker the
width<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> speaker<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> 12

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
width of the speaker and this is a 12

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
width of the speaker and this is a 12
inch<00:00:53.129> speaker<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.629> different

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
inch speaker you will get different

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.410 
inch speaker you will get different
tones<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.129> set<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
tones as you set this here and the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
tones as you set this here and the
proper<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.320> start<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.129> all

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
proper place to start with and it's all

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
proper place to start with and it's all
subjective<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> make

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
subjective and you can you can make

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
subjective and you can you can make
decisions<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> listen<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.340> but

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
decisions as you listen to it but

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
decisions as you listen to it but
normally<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> guitar<00:01:03.570> cabinet<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.650> set

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
normally on a guitar cabinet I will set

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.670 
normally on a guitar cabinet I will set
it<00:01:05.040> about<00:01:05.670> three<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.119> four<00:01:06.330> inches<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
it about three or four inches from the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730 
it about three or four inches from the
grid<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> grill<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
grid or the grill and just off the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
grid or the grill and just off the
center<00:01:11.240> access<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> you'll<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> little

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
center access and you'll get a little

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.200 
center access and you'll get a little
bit<00:01:13.140> warmer<00:01:13.710> better<00:01:14.340> tone<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bit warmer better tone if you want a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.990 
bit warmer better tone if you want a
brighter<00:01:16.009> tone<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.400> could<00:01:17.549> put<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> straight

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
brighter tone you could put it straight

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
brighter tone you could put it straight
in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> middle<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in the middle but this is kind of the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
in the middle but this is kind of the
common<00:01:20.100> place<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> first

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
common place to put that first

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.380 
common place to put that first
microphone<00:01:22.229> placement<00:01:22.850> same<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> snare

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
microphone placement same with the snare

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
microphone placement same with the snare
you<00:01:24.689> would<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.290> off-center<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you would put it just off-center on a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
you would put it just off-center on a
snare<00:01:26.520> drum<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> edge<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.170> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
snare drum off to the edge one you don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
snare drum off to the edge one you don't
want<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> guy<00:01:28.740> hitting<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.600> know

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
want the guy hitting it into you know

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
want the guy hitting it into you know
two<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:30.930> three<00:01:31.020> inches<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> top<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
two or three inches from the top of the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
two or three inches from the top of the
snare<00:01:32.400> sometimes<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
snare sometimes you can put it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.060 
snare sometimes you can put it
underneath<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> pick<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> snare

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
underneath and pick up the snare

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
underneath and pick up the snare
sometimes<00:01:35.579> you'll<00:01:35.820> use<00:01:36.380> two<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.740> for

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
sometimes you'll use two of these for

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
sometimes you'll use two of these for
the<00:01:38.640> snare<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.430> then<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.689> vocal

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the snare and then with the vocal

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.249 
the snare and then with the vocal
microphone<00:01:43.799> what's<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.850> important<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
microphone what's really important is to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
microphone what's really important is to
maximize<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.490> gain<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
maximize the gain of all of your

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
maximize the gain of all of your
microphones<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.920> them

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
microphones and that means get them

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.289 
microphones and that means get them
closer<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.140> distance<00:01:52.590> I'll

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
closer any time I have the distance I'll

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.889 
closer any time I have the distance I'll
gain<00:01:54.299> three<00:01:54.689> decibels<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.680> input<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
gain three decibels more input so the
