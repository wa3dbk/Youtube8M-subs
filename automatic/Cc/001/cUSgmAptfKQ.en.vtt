00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 he fell and his dad agreed to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.550
 that the attraction was fun though 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.220
 It was a little scary 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.750
 here I was having so much fun that 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.910

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.450
 wooden stick 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.250
