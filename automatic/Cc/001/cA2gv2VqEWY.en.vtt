what<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> need<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> bit<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
what you need to do is have a bit of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.790 
what you need to do is have a bit of
soap<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.470> water<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.220> cloth<00:00:30.170> it<00:00:31.170> should<00:00:31.410> move<00:00:31.650> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
soap and water a cloth it should move up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
soap and water a cloth it should move up
and<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.160> quite<00:00:32.870> reasonably<00:00:33.870> easily<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and down quite reasonably easily now to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
and down quite reasonably easily now to
make<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.320> easier<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.160> hard

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
make that a bit easier if it's too hard

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.770 
make that a bit easier if it's too hard
you<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> flat<00:00:40.020> bladed<00:00:40.290> screwdriver<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
you get a flat bladed screwdriver and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
you get a flat bladed screwdriver and
just<00:00:42.890> ease<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:45.980> now<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
just ease it up a little bit now if you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
just ease it up a little bit now if you
overdo<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.180> slides<00:00:48.629> around<00:00:48.899> too

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
overdo it and it just slides around too

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310 
overdo it and it just slides around too
easily<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.390> need<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
easily and all you really need to do is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.490 
easily and all you really need to do is
just<00:00:52.940> read<00:00:53.940> punch<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.480> again<00:00:55.280> like<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:57.500> maybe

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just read punch it again like this maybe

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.750 
just read punch it again like this maybe
a<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.800> harder<00:00:59.660> then<00:01:00.660> try<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.579> till<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> get

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
a bit harder then try that till you get

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.679 
a bit harder then try that till you get
it<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.270> right<00:01:04.549> there<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:06.799> now<00:01:08.689> the
