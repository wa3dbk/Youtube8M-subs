00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
as well the older PlayStation from the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.790 
as well the older PlayStation from the
new<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:50.950> um<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:53.140> not<00:01:53.230> really<00:01:53.350> nothing

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
new one um there's not really nothing

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.950 
new one um there's not really nothing
much<00:01:54.040> different<00:01:54.490> about<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.790> new<00:01:54.970> on<00:01:55.210> other

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
much different about the new on other

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.100 
much different about the new on other
than<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.410> being<00:01:56.440> slimmer<00:01:57.130> quieter<00:01:58.000> as<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.810> must

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
than it being slimmer quieter as I must

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.500 
than it being slimmer quieter as I must
say<00:01:59.350> the<00:02:00.010> old<00:02:00.430> PlayStation<00:02:01.120> does<00:02:01.270> get<00:02:01.480> very

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
say the old PlayStation does get very

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.930 
say the old PlayStation does get very
noisy<00:02:02.260> when<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.470> heats<00:02:02.650> up<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.070> vents<00:02:03.760> or

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
noisy when it heats up that vents or

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
relatively the same as the old one I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.490 
relatively the same as the old one I
think<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.750> new<00:03:24.900> year<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.410> actually

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
think about the new year you actually

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.260 
think about the new year you actually
have<00:03:25.860> two<00:03:26.040> USB<00:03:26.400> ports<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.760> same<00:03:26.910> as<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> old

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
have two USB ports the same as the old

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.000 
have two USB ports the same as the old
one<00:03:27.360> but<00:03:27.660> that's<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:27.989> unfortunate<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:28.830> their

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
one but that's all unfortunate but their

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.580 
one but that's all unfortunate but their
societies
