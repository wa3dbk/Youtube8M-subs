to be have no problem with it this was

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.580 
to be have no problem with it this was
brought<00:03:48.880> up<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.600> presser<00:03:49.959> after<00:03:50.230> practice

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
brought up in the presser after practice

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.590 
brought up in the presser after practice
today<00:03:50.739> how<00:03:51.100> do<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.280> think<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:52.090> team<00:03:52.299> is<00:03:52.329> going

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
today how do you think the team is going

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.509 
today how do you think the team is going
to<00:03:52.720> cope<00:03:52.900> with<00:03:53.049> having<00:03:53.170> fewer<00:03:53.769> practices<00:03:54.310> than

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
to cope with having fewer practices than

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.030 
to cope with having fewer practices than
they<00:03:54.640> did<00:03:54.700> last<00:03:54.850> year<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.480> Sun<00:03:55.750> Bowl

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
they did last year for the Sun Bowl

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.800 
they did last year for the Sun Bowl
didn't<00:03:57.040> really<00:03:57.280> works<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:58.360> know<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.690> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
didn't really works you know for that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.810 
didn't really works you know for that
standpoint<00:03:59.200> there<00:03:59.950> were<00:04:00.070> there<00:04:00.340> longer<00:04:00.579> they

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
standpoint there were there longer they

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.949 
standpoint there were there longer they
practice<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.420> worst<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.780> got<00:04:02.400> as<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.940> said<00:04:04.209> you'd

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
practice the worst I got as I said you'd

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.080 
practice the worst I got as I said you'd
like<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.350> have<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.650> more<00:04:05.799> practices<00:04:06.489> if<00:04:06.700> you

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
like to have the more practices if you

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550 
like to have the more practices if you
have<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.239> lighter<00:04:07.450> ball<00:04:07.660> game<00:04:07.930> for<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.260> younger

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
have a lighter ball game for the younger

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.920 
have a lighter ball game for the younger
guys<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> younger<00:04:09.700> guys<00:04:09.880> won't<00:04:10.239> get<00:04:10.450> now

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
guys so the younger guys won't get now

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.479 
guys so the younger guys won't get now
they<00:04:11.079> don't<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.500> many<00:04:11.620> younger<00:04:12.250> guys

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
they don't have as many younger guys

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.270 
they don't have as many younger guys
older<00:04:12.910> guys<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.500> from<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.530> standpoint<00:04:14.919> I'm

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
older guys so from that standpoint I'm

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.349 
older guys so from that standpoint I'm
not<00:04:15.459> sure<00:04:15.669> you<00:04:16.000> know

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
not sure you know

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.089 
not sure you know
team<00:04:16.509> practices<00:04:17.109> or<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.739> know<00:04:17.859> you're

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
team practices or you know you're

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.259 
team practices or you know you're
allowed<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.489> as<00:04:18.699> many<00:04:18.819> as<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.090> want

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
allowed to have as many as you want

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.789 
allowed to have as many as you want
actually<00:04:19.719> you<00:04:19.780> just<00:04:19.840> can't<00:04:20.139> go<00:04:20.289> over<00:04:20.439> the<00:04:20.530> 20

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.700

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710
