00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
puppets we can make the sets and we get

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.339

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
what Jamie wants that's what we're gonna

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.160 
what Jamie wants that's what we're gonna
end<00:02:25.560> up<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:25.769> right<00:02:26.430> there<00:02:26.670> that's<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> idea

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
end up with right there that's the idea

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660 
end up with right there that's the idea
you<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.709> kind<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> crude<00:02:29.160> print<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you know it's kind of a crude print but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
you know it's kind of a crude print but
we<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> physics<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
we get the physics of it all that's to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.490 
we get the physics of it all that's to
scale<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.459> then<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.480> gets<00:02:33.660> broken<00:02:33.930> up<00:02:34.230> into

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
scale and then that gets broken up into

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.130 
scale and then that gets broken up into
this<00:02:36.260> mess<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.530> body<00:02:38.190> parts<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> take<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
this mess of body parts so I take this I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.960 
this mess of body parts so I take this I
cut<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:41.069> into<00:02:41.400> their<00:02:41.760> own<00:02:41.880> specific

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
cut it up all into their own specific

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.569 
cut it up all into their own specific
pieces<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.650> put<00:02:44.040> them<00:02:44.099> together<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
pieces and then I put them together I

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.430 
pieces and then I put them together I
put<00:02:44.849> joints<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.299> them<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:46.049> sure<00:02:46.079> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
put joints on them and I make sure that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.479 
put joints on them and I make sure that
they<00:02:46.590> were<00:02:46.680> gonna<00:02:46.829> work<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.190> animator

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
they were gonna work for the animator

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.520 
they were gonna work for the animator

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
tabletops with real sets we have to do

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.690 
tabletops with real sets we have to do
every<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:00.959> movement<00:03:01.319> by<00:03:01.709> hand<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.430> frame

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
every little movement by hand one frame

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.670 
every little movement by hand one frame
at<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.940> time<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
at a time so it's kind of like a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.620 
at a time so it's kind of like a
handmade<00:03:05.040> film<00:03:05.400> which<00:03:05.609> is<00:03:05.790> not<00:03:05.970> done<00:03:06.420> too

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
handmade film which is not done too

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.710 
handmade film which is not done too
often<00:03:06.989> these<00:03:07.139> days<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.549> its<00:03:08.819> really<00:03:09.060> tense<00:03:09.450> is

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
often these days and its really tense is

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.289 
often these days and its really tense is
if<00:03:10.500> something<00:03:10.769> screws<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.180> shoot

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
if something screws up you got to shoot

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.809 
if something screws up you got to shoot
the<00:03:12.420> whole<00:03:12.540> thing<00:03:12.750> all<00:03:12.900> over<00:03:12.930> again<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:14.609> takes

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
the whole thing all over again it takes

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.240 
the whole thing all over again it takes
a<00:03:14.910> lot<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.060> concentration<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.859> lot<00:03:17.160> of

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
a lot of concentration and a lot of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.660 
a lot of concentration and a lot of
patience<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.730> suppose<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:19.950> really<00:03:20.220> focus

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
patience I suppose I just really focus

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.330 
patience I suppose I just really focus
in<00:03:20.849> on<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:21.840> doing<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.440> try<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.069> feel

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
in on what I'm doing and I try and feel

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.949 
in on what I'm doing and I try and feel
like<00:03:24.060> I'm<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.480> scene<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.870> the

each frame and remove the Riggin what I
love<00:03:50.750> about<00:03:50.930> doing<00:03:51.620> stop-motion<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:52.640> an

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
love about doing stop-motion is it's an

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.640 
love about doing stop-motion is it's an
organic<00:03:53.270> process<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.170> brain<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.410> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
the computer so you're always going to

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.300 
the computer so you're always going to
get<00:03:58.940> something<00:03:59.150> special<00:03:59.470> the<00:04:00.470> covers<00:04:01.100> being

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
pulled up over the Sun that seemed

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.750 
pulled up over the Sun that seemed
really<00:04:04.250> showed<00:04:05.090> what<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.110> piece<00:04:06.320> could<00:04:06.620> be

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
really showed what the piece could be

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.220 
really showed what the piece could be
Kim's<00:04:07.760> animation<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.480> hand<00:04:08.750> hand<00:04:08.989> is<00:04:09.080> so

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
Kim's animation of the hand hand is so

to<00:04:27.860> check<00:04:28.220> on<00:04:28.400> him<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.730> pull<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.120> covers<00:04:29.419> on

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.990 
ankles so you know it just came from
real<00:04:33.710> life<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.370> think<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.610> lot<00:04:34.729> of<00:04:34.850> dads

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
real life and I think a lot of dads

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.590 
real life and I think a lot of dads
could<00:04:35.270> relate<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.570> that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.870 

kids<00:04:40.600> if<00:04:41.110> they<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:42.130> their<00:04:42.280> parent<00:04:42.640> let<00:04:42.730> go

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
kids if they can see their parent let go

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.240 
kids if they can see their parent let go

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
of the world and go into some imaginary

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.100 
of the world and go into some imaginary
space<00:04:45.640> that<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.150> really<00:04:46.420> excites<00:04:46.870> them

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
space that that really excites them

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.320 
space that that really excites them
because<00:04:47.830> something's<00:04:48.100> like<00:04:48.280> oh<00:04:48.490> you're<00:04:49.060> gonna

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
experience of sharing the storytelling

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.990 
experience of sharing the storytelling
with<00:05:04.450> my<00:05:04.660> son<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:05.500> mixed<00:05:05.980> with<00:05:06.190> also<00:05:06.520> knowing

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
with my son that mixed with also knowing

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.550 
with my son that mixed with also knowing
that<00:05:07.240> feeling<00:05:07.810> what<00:05:07.930> it's<00:05:08.050> like<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.440> leave

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
that feeling what it's like to leave

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.350 
that feeling what it's like to leave
your<00:05:08.740> son<00:05:08.890> for<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> few<00:05:09.370> days<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.940> really

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
your son for a few days and really

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.300 
your son for a few days and really
missing<00:05:10.690> him<00:05:10.810> definitely<00:05:11.290> pushed<00:05:11.860> me<00:05:12.010> towards

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
missing him definitely pushed me towards

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.250 
missing him definitely pushed me towards
that<00:05:12.490> script<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.150> think<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.450> resonates<00:05:13.840> in

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
that script and I think it resonates in

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.210 
that script and I think it resonates in
the<00:05:14.290> piece<00:05:18.750> with<00:05:19.750> many<00:05:20.050> artists<00:05:20.650> their<00:05:20.860> goal

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.210 
is to make an emotional connection with
their<00:05:23.020> audience<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:24.810> really<00:05:25.810> feel<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.110> my<00:05:26.920> job

their audience I really feel that my job

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.970 
their audience I really feel that my job
is<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.670> think<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.570> someone<00:05:29.080> sitting<00:05:29.320> there<00:05:29.590> you
