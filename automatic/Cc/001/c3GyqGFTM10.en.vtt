00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.850
 modern wonders 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.850
 the technology of the 70s 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.099
 in the 70s the drivers of a trans am were not the only ones 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.759
 protested because they could not drive for more than 90 kilometers per hour 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.500
 truckers also wanted to step on the accelerator and a small 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.800
 attempt that was placed in the cabin allowed them to make fun of the law 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.640
 the opa the truth the OPEC notwithstanding the NATO 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.890
 that's a violation friends 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 it's weird that these contraptions transcend and turn into a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470
 national obsession 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.750
 however, that is what happened in the 70s with radio stations 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.710
 frequency 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.710
 in a decade where few had phone in the car 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.730
 the station became the official microphone of the drivers 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.330
 Americans 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.840
 understand it and it only amounted to entering an internet chat in our days 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.720
 the drivers that even their own props 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.630
 a good moment in the addictive power the big bob and my friends were called hands 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.650
 filthy there was everything even smelly 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 and abounded in his own peculiar language 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.760
 Catalan efe details 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.020
 I'm left with the phrase 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.370
 today the carriers mimic the language used by their colleagues 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.940
 of the 70 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 however the waves are not as saturated as then 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 in the 70's an average of 7 million of my hours was sold per year 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.030
 the eleven in those times everyone had an illusion the war 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.490
 because they spoke on the radio with all the favorites or with the grandmothers flies 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 I had one 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 the transmitters for vehicles worked like any radio transmitter 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.670
 they had 40 channels and they operated in a bandwidth of 24 27 megahertz 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.180
 however unlike the transmitter of a radio station 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.310
 that transmits through an antenna tower 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.880
 these stations had a small antenna of three meters that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 it provided a range of 8 kilometers 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.799
 in 1974 when the speed limit was lowered from 115 90 kilometers by 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.389
 hour 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 square that became the secret weapon of the drivers 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.180
 prisoner fraction 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.750
 transporters could travel more than 90 kilometers per hour and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.770
 winds so they used the stations to warn other drivers 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.770
 when they detected a police radar 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.650
 In 1975, popular culture had adopted broadcasters and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 drivers were launching to the adventure of the bandwidth 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.279
 the manufacturing companies like my plan in kansas city misurÃ­ started to 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.279
 produce stations in amazing amounts 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.870
 respect this particular model was one of our first 23 radio stations 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.759
 channels 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.799
 our god addressed to urban drivers was common to find him in a 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.959
 moment in which they avoid the increase in July a car of that 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.809
 style 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.299
 hidden principles of the seventy its price was around $ 100 ons 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.229
 like most fashions, the phenomenon of broadcasters soon became 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.219
 behind 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.609
 in the 80s the mobile phone replaced the radios in the cars and these 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.750
 they went back to their main users 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.880
 Truck drivers
