matches<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.640> May<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.159> very<00:01:17.369> very

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
matches in in May and it's very very

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.300 
matches in in May and it's very very
hard<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> away<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.380> IPL<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.100> finish

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hard to see away that the IPL can finish

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
hard to see away that the IPL can finish
but<00:01:20.880> before<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> end<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.600> April<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but before the end of April so in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
but before the end of April so in the
next<00:01:22.530> three<00:01:22.680> years<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.390> know

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
next three years it's you know

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
next three years it's you know
completely<00:01:24.900> unrealistic<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.650> far<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> see

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
completely unrealistic as far as I see

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.289 
completely unrealistic as far as I see
it<00:01:26.420> because<00:01:27.439> next<00:01:28.439> year<00:01:28.560> you've<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
it because next year you've got the

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
it because next year you've got the
twenty20<00:01:30.299> World<00:01:30.330> Cup<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.780> Bangladesh<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh the
year<00:01:32.400> after<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.729> you've<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> World<00:01:33.360> Cup

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
year after that you've got the World Cup

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
year after that you've got the World Cup
and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> year<00:01:34.259> after<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.500> you've<00:01:34.799> got

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and the year after that you've got

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.070 
and the year after that you've got
another<00:01:35.310> twenty20<00:01:35.790> World<00:01:35.820> Cup<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.330> India<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
another twenty20 World Cup in India and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.800 
another twenty20 World Cup in India and
and<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.070> things<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.790> into<00:01:39.060> March<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and these things go right into March and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
and these things go right into March and
it's<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.140> hard<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:42.090> March<00:01:42.330> at<00:01:42.509> least

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's very hard to see but March at least

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's very hard to see but March at least
actually<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.520> no<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
actually and it's if there's no way in

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.800 
actually and it's if there's no way in
the<00:01:44.970> next<00:01:45.090> three<00:01:45.330> years<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the next three years you can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
the next three years you can
realistically<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> IPL<00:01:47.100> finishing

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
realistically see the IPL finishing

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940 
realistically see the IPL finishing
early<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> sign

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
early but I think what this is is a sign

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
early but I think what this is is a sign
that<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.369> ECB<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:51.090> struggling<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:52.110> meet<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that the ECB are struggling to meet the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
that the ECB are struggling to meet the
demands<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.960> players<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.350> going

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
demands that the the players are going

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.660 
demands that the the players are going
to<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> year<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.220> their<00:01:56.310> salary

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to make this year for their salary

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
to make this year for their salary
increases<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.210> another<00:02:00.350> indication

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
increases and is this another indication

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
increases and is this another indication
that<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:03.979> ECB<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.399> realizing<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> more

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that the ECB are realizing that more

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.529 
that the ECB are realizing that more
England<00:02:07.079> players<00:02:07.290> more<00:02:07.680> full-time<00:02:08.539> that's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
England players more full-time that's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
England players more full-time that's
what<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:10.019> them<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.159> play<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730

what we can call them want to play in
the<00:02:11.849> IPL<00:02:12.319> I'm<00:02:13.319> not<00:02:13.529> completely<00:02:13.799> convinced

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:14.309 
the IPL I'm not completely convinced

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.769 
the IPL I'm not completely convinced
they<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.489> want<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.819> play<00:02:14.999> in<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> IPL<00:02:15.599> that's

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.899 
they do want to play in the IPL that's
not<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.019> they're<00:02:16.139> really<00:02:16.559> saying<00:02:16.980> off<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
not what they're really saying off the

happy to be paid the money for not doing
anything<00:02:23.440> but<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.860> ECB<00:02:25.520> want<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.090> find<00:02:26.330> the

enable them to play in the IPL the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.589 
enable them to play in the IPL the
crucial<00:02:31.010> thing<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.310> yeah<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.790> they<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
crucial thing is yeah that they the

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.180 
crucial thing is yeah that they the
players<00:02:33.170> learn<00:02:33.380> recently<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
players learn recently that the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.490 
players learn recently that the
Australian<00:02:35.030> players<00:02:35.300> would<00:02:35.569> play<00:02:35.780> pain<00:02:36.230> about

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
Australian players would play pain about

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.740 
Australian players would play pain about
twice<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.040> much<00:02:37.340> as<00:02:37.580> them<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.450> that's<00:02:38.599> crucial

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
twice as much as them and that's crucial

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
twice as much as them and that's crucial
and<00:02:39.260> one<00:02:39.440> thing<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.709> did<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.980> did<00:02:40.370> make<00:02:40.610> me

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and one thing it did it did make me

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.490 
and one thing it did it did make me
smile<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.390> saw<00:02:41.569> David<00:02:41.810> Collier<00:02:42.170> saying

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
smile that I saw David Collier saying

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.740 
smile that I saw David Collier saying
that<00:02:42.769> he<00:02:42.980> would<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.760> IPL<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.690> be

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
that he would like the IPL to be

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.380 
that he would like the IPL to be
finished<00:02:45.050> before<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.440> got<00:02:45.560> too<00:02:45.769> hot<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:46.220> India

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
finished before it got too hot in India

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.059 
finished before it got too hot in India
I<00:02:47.390> thought<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.260> quite<00:02:48.319> disingenuous

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I thought that was quite disingenuous

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.949 
I thought that was quite disingenuous
because<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:49.430> pretty<00:02:49.730> sure<00:02:49.970> he's<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
because I'm pretty sure he's not that

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:51.910 
because I'm pretty sure he's not that
worried<00:02:51.290> about<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> players<00:02:51.709> getting

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
worried about the players getting

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.740 
worried about the players getting
sunburned<00:02:52.370> or<00:02:52.489> getting<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.760> bit<00:02:52.910> worn<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
sunburned or getting a bit worn this is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.020 
sunburned or getting a bit worn this is
purely<00:02:54.140> about<00:02:54.440> money<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.459> purely<00:02:55.850> about

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
purely about money and it's purely about

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.750 
purely about money and it's purely about
the<00:02:56.209> ECB<00:02:57.049> finding<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.739> way<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> meet<00:02:58.430> their

the ECB finding a way to meet their

the ECB finding a way to meet their
player<00:02:59.030> salary<00:02:59.540> demands

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
player salary demands

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.759 
player salary demands
I<00:03:01.880> suppose<00:03:02.750> speculating<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.470> looking

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
I suppose speculating and looking

I suppose speculating and looking
forward

fruitful can you really see any

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.210 
fruitful can you really see any
compromise<00:03:13.549> coming<00:03:14.480> at<00:03:14.599> least<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.220> short

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
compromise coming at least in the short

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.580 
compromise coming at least in the short

term future big city as you make I can

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.920 
term future big city as you make I can
see<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:19.130> lot<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.510> compromise<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.690> short

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
see a lot of compromise in the short

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.080 
see a lot of compromise in the short
term<00:03:21.110> simply<00:03:21.470> because<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.519> can't<00:03:22.790> get<00:03:22.910> two

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
term simply because you can't get two

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.420 
term simply because you can't get two
pints<00:03:23.480> into<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.750> pint<00:03:24.019> glass<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.799> there's<00:03:25.250> just

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
pints into a pint glass and there's just

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.000 
pints into a pint glass and there's just
so<00:03:25.549> much<00:03:25.670> cricket<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.959> think<00:03:27.560> there<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so much cricket but I think there the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.740 
so much cricket but I think there the
VCC<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.489> would<00:03:28.880> like<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> English<00:03:29.390> players<00:03:29.600> to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
VCC I would like the English players to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.699 
VCC I would like the English players to
be<00:03:29.810> there<00:03:29.959> they'd<00:03:30.079> love<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.260> have<00:03:30.440> Kevin

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
be there they'd love to have Kevin

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.740 
be there they'd love to have Kevin
Peterson<00:03:31.100> who<00:03:31.250> wouldn't<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.359> one<00:03:32.600> or<00:03:32.720> two

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
Peterson who wouldn't and one or two

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.360 
Peterson who wouldn't and one or two
other<00:03:32.989> English<00:03:33.350> players<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:33.799> well<00:03:33.829> no<00:03:34.160> doubt

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
other English players as well no doubt

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.580 
other English players as well no doubt
so<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.239> can<00:03:35.600> see<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.019> there's<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.260> willingness

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so I can see that there's a willingness

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.380 
so I can see that there's a willingness
to<00:03:36.769> talk<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> willingness<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.850> work<00:03:38.000> things

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
to talk and a willingness to work things

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.599 
to talk and a willingness to work things
out<00:03:38.540> because<00:03:38.930> actually<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.920> benefits

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
out because actually it benefits

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.580 
out because actually it benefits
everybody<00:03:40.880> but<00:03:41.510> I'm<00:03:41.600> just<00:03:41.750> not<00:03:41.989> sure<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.290> can

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
everybody but I'm just not sure I can

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.830 
everybody but I'm just not sure I can

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
see a way that that can happen in the

see a way that that can happen in the
short<00:03:45.019> term<00:03:45.319> there's<00:03:45.799> one<00:03:45.950> other<00:03:46.130> thing<00:03:46.430> that

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
short term there's one other thing that

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.180 
short term there's one other thing that
that<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.299> understand<00:03:47.780> cricket<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.709> ESPN

cricinfo is that there is a there have

dropping one of the may tests now that

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
would in many ways make quite a lot of

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.180 
would in many ways make quite a lot of
sense<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.810> I'm<00:04:03.290> told<00:04:03.620> they've<00:04:03.980> even

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
sense and I'm told they've even

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.009 
sense and I'm told they've even
discussed<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> possibility<00:04:05.780> of<00:04:05.810> being

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
discussed the possibility of being

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.170 
discussed the possibility of being
compensated<00:04:06.470> for<00:04:06.980> doing<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.370> by<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.579> BCCI

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
compensated for doing that by the BCCI

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.289 
compensated for doing that by the BCCI
which<00:04:08.480> sounds<00:04:08.900> incredible<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:10.489> actually<00:04:11.239> I

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
which sounds incredible but actually I

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.910 
which sounds incredible but actually I
believe<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:12.019> there<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> bit<00:04:12.829> of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
believe is you know there is a bit of

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.910 
believe is you know there is a bit of
truth<00:04:13.100> there<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:15.350> problem<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.769> is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
truth there the problem with that is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.960 
truth there the problem with that is
that<00:04:15.950> they<00:04:16.160> have<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> deal<00:04:16.639> with<00:04:16.789> their

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that they have a deal with their

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.029 
that they have a deal with their
broadcast<00:04:17.570> partners<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.229> they're<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.889> ones

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
broadcast partners and they're the ones

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.190 
broadcast partners and they're the ones
who<00:04:19.130> are<00:04:19.220> going<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.430> need<00:04:19.549> compensating<00:04:20.419> so

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
who are going to need compensating so

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200 
who are going to need compensating so
whichever<00:04:21.650> problem<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.310> solve<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:23.150> just

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
whichever problem you solve it just

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.320 
whichever problem you solve it just
seems<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.350> find<00:04:25.250> yourself<00:04:25.700> confronted

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
seems that you find yourself confronted

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.710 
seems that you find yourself confronted
with<00:04:26.570> another<00:04:26.630> one<00:04:27.229> I<00:04:28.060> mean<00:04:29.060> this<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.479> it's

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
with another one I mean this that it's

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.390 
with another one I mean this that it's
going<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.960> take<00:04:30.140> several<00:04:30.620> years<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:31.159> find<00:04:31.340> a

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
going to take several years to find a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.320 
going to take several years to find a
solution<00:04:31.669> to<00:04:31.970> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
solution to this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.270 
solution to this
and<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.900> can't<00:04:33.259> see<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.650> English<00:04:33.860> players<00:04:34.129> been

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
