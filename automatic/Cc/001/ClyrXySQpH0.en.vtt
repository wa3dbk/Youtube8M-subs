we<00:00:16.789> have<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.029> luxury<00:00:17.599> that<00:00:17.929> not<00:00:18.140> all<00:00:18.380> school

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
we have a luxury that not all school

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.620 
we have a luxury that not all school
systems<00:00:19.160> have<00:00:19.429> and<00:00:19.640> as<00:00:19.789> I've<00:00:20.029> said<00:00:20.329> I've<00:00:20.599> been

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
systems have and as I've said I've been

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.870 
systems have and as I've said I've been
a<00:00:20.840> veteran<00:00:21.109> teacher<00:00:21.560> this<00:00:21.919> is<00:00:21.980> my<00:00:22.250> 33rd<00:00:22.849> year

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
a veteran teacher this is my 33rd year

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.779 
a veteran teacher this is my 33rd year
so<00:00:23.689> I've<00:00:24.140> seen<00:00:24.439> different<00:00:24.859> schools<00:00:25.220> setups

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
so I've seen different schools setups

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.889 
so I've seen different schools setups
but<00:00:26.149> this<00:00:26.509> one<00:00:26.980> really<00:00:27.980> allows<00:00:28.669> us<00:00:29.059> the<00:00:29.539> time

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:29.899 
but this one really allows us the time

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.740 
but this one really allows us the time
we<00:00:29.929> need<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:31.369> plan<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:32.930> talk<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:34.280> really<00:00:34.750> make

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
we need to plan to talk to really make

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.009 
we need to plan to talk to really make
our<00:00:35.930> changes<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.860> schedule<00:00:37.720> was<00:00:38.720> quite<00:00:38.989> the

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
our changes the schedule was quite the

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.189 
our changes the schedule was quite the
challenge<00:00:39.379> we<00:00:40.100> don't<00:00:40.339> if<00:00:40.879> there's<00:00:41.659> one<00:00:41.930> area

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
challenge we don't if there's one area

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.110 
challenge we don't if there's one area
in<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.620> school<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.070> is<00:00:43.120> totally

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
in the school that is totally

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.490 
in the school that is totally
non-traditional<00:00:44.449> I'd<00:00:44.989> say<00:00:45.229> it's<00:00:45.379> our

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
non-traditional I'd say it's our

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.969 
non-traditional I'd say it's our
schedule<00:00:45.890> we<00:00:46.339> have<00:00:46.550> prep<00:00:46.909> time<00:00:47.439> and<00:00:48.439> 45

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
schedule we have prep time and 45

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.189 
schedule we have prep time and 45
minutes<00:00:49.460> every<00:00:49.850> day<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.390> collaborate<00:00:51.049> with

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
minutes every day to collaborate with

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.810 
minutes every day to collaborate with
other<00:00:51.379> teachers<00:00:51.710> sometimes<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.519> set<00:00:52.699> up

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
other teachers sometimes to set up

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.759 
other teachers sometimes to set up
meeting<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:53.449> parents<00:00:53.720> or<00:00:54.170> just<00:00:54.439> among

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
meeting with parents or just among

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.799 
meeting with parents or just among
ourselves<00:00:55.330> philosophically<00:00:56.330> we<00:00:56.479> believe

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
ourselves philosophically we believe

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.359 
ourselves philosophically we believe
that<00:00:57.229> the<00:00:57.350> teachers<00:00:57.710> have<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.040> work<00:00:58.189> together

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
that the teachers have to work together

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:59.950 
that the teachers have to work together
and<00:00:58.699> that<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.939> teams<00:00:59.150> have<00:00:59.509> to<00:00:59.659> work<00:00:59.809> together

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
and that the teams have to work together

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.020 
and that the teams have to work together
it<00:01:00.680> definitely<00:01:01.129> helps<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.580> have<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.759> longer

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
it definitely helps to have a longer

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.090 
it definitely helps to have a longer
school<00:01:02.360> day<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.629> just<00:01:02.900> more<00:01:03.409> time<00:01:03.619> means<00:01:03.979> you

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
school day you just more time means you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.399 
school day you just more time means you
can<00:01:04.250> do<00:01:04.369> more<00:01:04.580> things<00:01:04.610> obviously<00:01:05.449> but<00:01:06.259> we

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
can do more things obviously but we

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.020 
can do more things obviously but we
worked<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:06.979> made<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.340> priority<00:01:07.520> and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
worked it in we made it a priority and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.120 
worked it in we made it a priority and
worked<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:08.869> every<00:01:09.439> teacher<00:01:09.710> every

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
worked it in so that every teacher every

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.999 
worked it in so that every teacher every
grade<00:01:11.000> team<00:01:11.360> has<00:01:11.810> common<00:01:12.259> prep<00:01:12.470> period<00:01:12.890> so

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
grade team has common prep period so

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.469 
grade team has common prep period so
that<00:01:13.130> they<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.490> meet<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:13.850> then<00:01:14.329> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
that they can meet and then the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.819 
that they can meet and then the
administrators<00:01:15.170> work<00:01:15.380> around<00:01:15.650> their

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
administrators work around their

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.679 
administrators work around their
schedule<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.549> there's<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.880> lot<00:01:17.150> of<00:01:17.210> team

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
schedule so that there's a lot of team

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.039 
schedule so that there's a lot of team
meetings<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:18.829> mingle<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.000> talk<00:01:20.420> amongst

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
meetings we mingle and we talk amongst

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.800 
meetings we mingle and we talk amongst
ourselves<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.710> we<00:01:22.009> ask<00:01:22.759> about<00:01:23.359> what

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
ourselves and we ask about what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.690 
ourselves and we ask about what
techniques<00:01:24.289> are<00:01:24.499> working<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.189> if<00:01:25.280> we<00:01:25.460> see

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
techniques are working and if we see

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700 
techniques are working and if we see
something<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.359> classroom<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:27.049> junior

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
something in a classroom that junior

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.499 
something in a classroom that junior
class<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.189> really<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:28.609> task<00:01:28.909> what<00:01:29.240> did<00:01:29.359> you

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
class was really on task what did you

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.510 
class was really on task what did you
what<00:01:29.689> was<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.899> magic<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.590> not<00:01:30.799> magic<00:01:31.310> it's

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
what was the magic it's not magic it's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.389 
what was the magic it's not magic it's
we<00:01:31.850> tell<00:01:32.119> them<00:01:32.299> what<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.539> expect<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:33.889> show<00:01:34.159> them

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
we tell them what we expect we show them

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.090 
we tell them what we expect we show them
what<00:01:34.579> we<00:01:34.729> expect<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.659> we<00:01:36.649> model<00:01:37.189> it

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.160

they're true partners when my first year
teaching<00:01:55.340> he<00:01:55.700> actually<00:01:56.090> had<00:01:56.509> visited<00:01:57.020> all<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
teaching he actually had visited all the

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.710 
teaching he actually had visited all the
homes<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.190> students<00:01:58.909> before<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.450> first

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
day of school and that made a huge

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.450 
day of school and that made a huge
difference<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:03.920> other<00:02:04.039> words<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.399> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
difference so in other words in the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.039 
difference so in other words in the
beginning<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.000> year<00:02:05.270> they<00:02:05.479> sign<00:02:05.810> off<00:02:06.020> and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
beginning of the year they sign off and

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.460 
beginning of the year they sign off and
say<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:07.580> buy<00:02:07.789> in<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.569> understand<00:02:09.080> your<00:02:09.229> school

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
say we buy in we understand your school

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.140 
say we buy in we understand your school
day<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.709> longer<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.250> understand<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.910> school

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
day is longer we understand your school

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.300 
day is longer we understand your school
year<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.450> longer<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:12.230> buy<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.739> we'll<00:02:13.130> do

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
year is longer we buy in we'll do

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.800 
year is longer we buy in we'll do
whatever<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.640> takes<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.000> help<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
whatever it takes to help you out and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.830 
whatever it takes to help you out and
that<00:02:15.380> really<00:02:15.950> defines<00:02:16.580> our<00:02:17.090> parent<00:02:17.690> role

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that really defines our parent role

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.020 
that really defines our parent role
because<00:02:18.560> if<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.800> parents<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.310> involved<00:02:19.640> that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
because if the parents are involved that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.120 
because if the parents are involved that
they<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.600> consistently<00:02:21.380> reinforce

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
they can just consistently reinforce

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.880 
they can just consistently reinforce
what<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:23.090> we're<00:02:23.269> doing<00:02:23.660> at<00:02:23.900> home<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.440> then

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
what what we're doing at home and then

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.559 
what what we're doing at home and then
they<00:02:25.069> can<00:02:25.280> consist<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.060> consistently

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
they can consist we can consistently

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.630 
they can consist we can consistently
reinforce<00:02:27.080> say<00:02:27.620> their<00:02:27.800> family<00:02:28.100> values<00:02:28.430> within

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
reinforce say their family values within

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
reinforce say their family values within
the<00:02:28.790> classroom<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:29.989> shows<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the classroom so it really shows the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.890 
the classroom so it really shows the
student<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.100> two<00:02:31.819> independent<00:02:32.450> parties<00:02:32.780> I

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.320 
well and that both in both parties care
about<00:02:37.700> them

three<00:03:03.980> additional<00:03:04.990> assessments<00:03:05.990> throughout

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290

the year and that assessment allows us

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.160 
the year and that assessment allows us
to<00:03:09.980> inform<00:03:10.400> instruction<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.570> take<00:03:11.870> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
to inform instruction we really take you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.780 
to inform instruction we really take you
know<00:03:12.290> extra<00:03:12.590> time<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:13.070> really<00:03:13.250> realize<00:03:13.760> what

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
know extra time to really realize what

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.550 
know extra time to really realize what
the<00:03:14.090> needs<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.420> all<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.600> our<00:03:14.780> students<00:03:15.230> are<00:03:15.350> and

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the needs of all of our students are and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.890 
the needs of all of our students are and
once<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.460> realize<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.210> needs<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.570> strengths

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
once we realize the needs of strengths

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.470 
once we realize the needs of strengths
and<00:03:18.020> weaknesses<00:03:18.410> we<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.100> really<00:03:19.480> establish

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and weaknesses we can really establish

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.449 
and weaknesses we can really establish
an<00:03:20.660> individual<00:03:21.260> plans<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.920> order<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.280> raise

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
an individual plans in order to raise

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
an individual plans in order to raise
student<00:03:22.700> achievement<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.480> think<00:03:23.930> our<00:03:24.080> students

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
student achievement I think our students

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.710 
student achievement I think our students
are<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.830> like<00:03:24.980> any<00:03:25.220> other<00:03:25.310> students<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.209> think

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
are just like any other students I think

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840 
are just like any other students I think
it's<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.959> approach<00:03:27.440> i<00:03:27.890> think<00:03:28.580> it's<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it's the approach i think it's the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.970 
it's the approach i think it's the
involvement<00:03:29.540> i<00:03:30.160> think<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:32.209> lot<00:03:32.990> of<00:03:33.290> people

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
involvement i think it's a lot of people

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.610 
involvement i think it's a lot of people
working<00:03:34.640> towards<00:03:35.330> helping<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:36.050> students

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
working towards helping the students

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.370 
working towards helping the students
attain<00:03:37.100> what<00:03:37.160> they<00:03:37.490> can<00:03:37.670> attain<00:03:38.380> there's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
attain what they can attain there's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.640 
attain what they can attain there's
nothing<00:03:39.770> magical<00:03:40.370> or<00:03:40.550> mystical<00:03:40.580> about<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.650> we

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
nothing magical or mystical about it we

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.699 
nothing magical or mystical about it we
take<00:03:42.890> students<00:03:43.370> where<00:03:43.610> they<00:03:43.640> are<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:45.440> help

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
take students where they are and we help

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.259 
take students where they are and we help
them<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.010> grow<00:03:46.160> where<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:46.580> can<00:03:46.820> be<00:03:46.850> and

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
them to grow where they can be and

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.160 
them to grow where they can be and
that's<00:03:48.110> what<00:03:48.680> we<00:03:48.890> do
