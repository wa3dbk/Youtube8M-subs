00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 How about buying a car with 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.540
 details that you have chosen when 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.389
 Speak in aston martin this is totally 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:17.640
 possible to know better the powerful 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 sell your convertible manual or 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 robotic 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 you choose what you can do 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 also with body colors are 40 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 different 30 side 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.210
 doors and steering wheel 15 panel colors 10 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 seat belt only and eight of the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.059
 and if you do not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 like no one's in the loop 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 favorite aston martin does 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 it is impossible to find a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.960
 wind equal to the other nÃ© 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 each car is personalized this is the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 philosophy of the famous English factory that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.379
 still leaves no doubt as to the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 quality of materials 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.470
 the finishing and finishing touches are like 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.549
 be suitable for a model of these 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.979
 reviews 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.860
 the result of artisanal work in the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.110
 car montage business card template 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 take 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.640
 the console a pen when opening the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.720
 doors slightly rises so as not to knock 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.750
 on the wire and on the trunk 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.500
 Umbrella but I did not find it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.909
 that they are only luxury and comfort emotion 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.929
 accelerating is not lacking at all 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.619
 even more a 4.7-liter v8 engine that 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.049
 offers 426 horses and a beautiful 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.079
 touch that allows high performance 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.700
 the fame of taking all this with a good 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.479
 that the extravagant direct of the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.590
 and even their games linked to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.549
 these predicates for those who like 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.849
 to drive 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.439
 ideal is the manual 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.750
 rear axle for better 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.750
 weight distribution has six gears 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.390
 has quick and precise couplings 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.459
 take advantage of all the engine power to the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.500
 who want more comfort there is 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.269
 option of manual robotised 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.269
 seven gears 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.250
 but when used in automatic mode 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.709
 disappoints it has that hiccups 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.019
 during the exchanges that bothers 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.379
 to minimize the problem you can do 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.660
 the changes in the letters behind the wheel 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.549
 there is between us the automatic 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 double clutch would be much more 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.750
 suitable for a car of this suit 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.239
 anyway both the pt and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.090
 convertible regardless of the type of 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.060
 exchange rate reach 100 kilometers per 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.040
 time in less than 5 seconds and only stop 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.859
 us 290 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.079
 despite this fury all v8 is well 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.410
 elastic band allowing this parade in 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.840
 low speed without problems opening 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.700
 or close the hood by walking to 25 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.700
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.760
 17 min my southern fight that only lasts 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.069
 rafael and there I am single indecisive throughout 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.569
 that the stability of the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.970
 funk is exemplary 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.849
 if you abuse the electronic controls 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 help a flower the house in order more 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.840
 can also be turned off 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.769
 in terms of experience to master the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.180
 You want to take one out of the cage and 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.450
 put in your garage 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.370
 then start reserving the 720 thousand reais 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.470
 to have the 1,765 coupe for the convertible 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.420
 and balance to increase the check to 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.420
 as you customize
