00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
through a bird's territory where we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.869 
through a bird's territory where we
carefully<00:02:16.599> walk<00:02:17.049> scanning<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.010> ground<00:02:18.280> for

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
carefully walk scanning the ground for

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.960 
carefully walk scanning the ground for
signs<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> nest<00:02:20.200> their<00:02:21.190> nests<00:02:21.549> are<00:02:21.640> very

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
signs of a nest their nests are very

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.539 
signs of a nest their nests are very
hard<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.420> find<00:02:22.599> they're<00:02:23.170> constructed<00:02:23.860> out<00:02:24.250> of

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
hard to find they're constructed out of

hard to find they're constructed out of
dead<00:02:24.879> grass<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.629> they're<00:02:26.080> built<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> dome

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280

so<00:02:28.030> even<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:28.540> you're<00:02:28.659> looking<00:02:28.780> down<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.229 
was an active nest
I<00:02:35.470> would<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:36.099> bringing<00:02:36.280> anyone<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I would not be bringing anyone here to

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.850 
I would not be bringing anyone here to
see<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.510> because<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.230> very<00:02:38.440> sensitive

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860

thing if and when we do find this we are
very<00:02:42.099> careful<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.879> stay<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.299> area<00:02:43.569> only

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
for a very short time we usually mark

then we back away as soon as possible to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
primarily has to do with the fact that
