00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
because um i think the skin gives extra

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.380 
because um i think the skin gives extra
nutrients<00:03:07.310> with<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.490> dark<00:03:07.700> green<00:03:07.850> color<00:03:07.910> and

nutrients with a dark green color and
everything<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.140> doesn't<00:03:09.440> change<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
everything and it doesn't change the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.340
