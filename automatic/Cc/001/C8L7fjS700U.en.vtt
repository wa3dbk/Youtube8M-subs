reputation<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> eBay<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.050> he<00:00:37.050> had<00:00:37.140> around<00:00:37.320> 30

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
reputation on eBay is he had around 30

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.119 
reputation on eBay is he had around 30
feedbacks<00:00:38.390> 100%<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.989> too<00:00:40.320> much<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
feedbacks 100% so not too much but I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.690 
guess he looked like a legit seller
right

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700

image off the internet and a lot of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
image off the internet and a lot of
people<00:00:51.239> still<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.129> that<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.280> legit<00:00:53.699> but

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
people still do this that are legit but

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
people still do this that are legit but
what<00:00:55.020> happened<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.949> guy<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
what happened is this guy was actually a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
what happened is this guy was actually a
fake<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.480> received<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.109> package<00:00:58.410> today

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
fake and I received this package today

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
fake and I received this package today
this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> packaging<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> received<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this is the packaging I received it in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
this is the packaging I received it in
so<00:01:02.039> obviously<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> looks<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
so obviously right from the looks you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.520 
so obviously right from the looks you
can<00:01:03.780> tell<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> suspicious<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
can tell something is suspicious but so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
can tell something is suspicious but so
basically<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
basically this is how it looks like this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.060 
basically this is how it looks like this
is<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> fake<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> replica<00:01:10.290> whatever<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:10.979> to

sound
plasticky<00:02:52.630> sound<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.580> warrant

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
plasticky sound but if that's a warrant

but you can hear that you can hear the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.980 
but you can hear that you can hear the
volume<00:02:57.100> rocker<00:02:57.340> buttons<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.510> completely

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
volume rocker buttons this is completely

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.350 
volume rocker buttons this is completely
wobbly<00:02:59.710> so<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.730> tell<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.090> kind<00:03:01.330> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
wobbly so you can tell that's kind of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.030 
wobbly so you can tell that's kind of
way<00:03:01.870> off<00:03:02.080> but<00:03:02.740> here's<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> quick<00:03:03.310> look<00:03:04.860> from<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
way off but here's a quick look from the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.510 
way off but here's a quick look from the
two<00:03:06.250> comparisons<00:03:08.640> kind<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.700> side<00:03:09.910> by<00:03:10.060> side<00:03:11.520> so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
two comparisons kind of side by side so

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.290 
two comparisons kind of side by side so
huge<00:03:12.820> difference<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.750> color<00:03:14.400> both<00:03:15.400> say<00:03:15.730> iPhone

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
huge difference in color both say iPhone

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.170 
huge difference in color both say iPhone

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
on the back so there's a glossy finish

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.320 
on the back so there's a glossy finish
on<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.450> one<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.200> white<00:03:21.330> other

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
on this one this is just white other

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.020 
on this one this is just white other
than<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> Apple<00:03:24.130> logos<00:03:24.489> why<00:03:24.730> here

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
than that and the Apple logos why here

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.199 
than that and the Apple logos why here
for<00:03:25.180> some<00:03:25.330> reason<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.640> whole<00:03:27.820> screen

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
for some reason but and the whole screen

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.120 
for some reason but and the whole screen
it's<00:03:28.420> just<00:03:28.630> like<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.140> image<00:03:29.500> which<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.739> I

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
it's just like on this image which is I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.440 
it's just like on this image which is I
find<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.489> really<00:03:30.670> weird<00:03:31.000> too

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
find that really weird too

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.420 
find that really weird too
but<00:03:32.020> yes<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.680> pretty<00:03:32.950> much<00:03:33.070> just

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
but yes so this is pretty much just

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.010
