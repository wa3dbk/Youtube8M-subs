and minute and hour so starting with how

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890 
and minute and hour so starting with how
often<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> always<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.779> your

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
often so this is always so just your

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.509 
often so this is always so just your
finger<00:00:19.140> circling<00:00:19.500> rent<00:00:19.650> always<00:00:20.119> often

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
finger circling rent always often

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.120 
finger circling rent always often
sometimes<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:25.019> next<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> once<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
sometimes the next one is once in a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
sometimes the next one is once in a
while<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.750> slower<00:00:27.960> once<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
while so it's a lot slower once in a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.280 
while so it's a lot slower once in a
while<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.929> never<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:32.270> length<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
while and never a length of time so this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
while and never a length of time so this
is<00:00:34.440> ten<00:00:34.739> until<00:00:35.750> three<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.670> until<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.059> just
