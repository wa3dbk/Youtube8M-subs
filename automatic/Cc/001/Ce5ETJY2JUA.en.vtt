00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
way back when when I did a review on a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
way back when when I did a review on a
Android<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.929> basically<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> same<00:00:46.649> thing

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
Android it was basically the same thing

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180 
Android it was basically the same thing
I<00:00:47.250> did<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.179> utility<00:00:48.859> emulator<00:00:49.859> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I did but it was a utility emulator that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
I did but it was a utility emulator that
allowed<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> emulate<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.690> Android

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
allowed you to emulate the Android

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
allowed you to emulate the Android
operating<00:00:52.379> system<00:00:52.859> on<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.969> iOS<00:00:54.210> device

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
operating system on your iOS device

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.380 
operating system on your iOS device
without<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.800> taking<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.609> your<00:00:56.730> device<00:00:57.089> like

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
without it taking over your device like

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
without it taking over your device like
DreamBoy<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> dream<00:00:58.710> mode<00:00:58.859> takes

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
DreamBoy you see how a dream mode takes

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.489 
DreamBoy you see how a dream mode takes
over<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> device<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.780> very<00:01:01.019> scary<00:01:01.320> like

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
over a device that was very scary like

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.549 
over a device that was very scary like
an<00:01:01.679> app<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.390> can<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.839> launch<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
an app and you can just launch it and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
an app and you can just launch it and
boom<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.040> won<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> Android

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
boom you won right into the Android

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390 
boom you won right into the Android
operating<00:01:06.510> system<00:01:06.870> now<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.800> similar<00:01:08.070> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
operating system now this is similar but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.500 
operating system now this is similar but
this<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.360> Windows<00:01:09.630> instead<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this one is for Windows instead so when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.690 
this one is for Windows instead so when
you<00:01:12.630> install<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.050> nothing<00:01:14.010> new<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> added<00:01:14.400> in

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.910 
you want to come back out to your
iDevice<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.690> tap<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.079> home<00:03:55.319> button<00:03:55.349> and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
iDevice you just tap the home button and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.650 
iDevice you just tap the home button and
it<00:03:56.010> automatically<00:03:56.640> closed<00:03:57.030> out<00:03:57.299> so<00:03:57.510> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
it automatically closed out so it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.080 
it automatically closed out so it
doesn't<00:03:57.900> take<00:03:58.769> over<00:03:58.950> your<00:03:59.250> iDevice<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.879> can

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
doesn't take over your iDevice you can

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.900 
doesn't take over your iDevice you can
switch<00:04:00.360> between<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.930> windows<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.519> iOS

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
switch between the windows and the iOS

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.640 
switch between the windows and the iOS
which<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.569> cool<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.440> basically

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
which is cool I think it's basically
