00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
defense put you in a very very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
defense put you in a very very
vulnerable<00:01:11.549> situation<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.510> an<00:01:12.659> offense

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
vulnerable situation as an offense

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
vulnerable situation as an offense
especially<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.340> Stadium<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.420> the

noise without ball-hawking that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.999 
noise without ball-hawking that
secondary<00:01:18.030> linebacking<00:01:18.659> corps<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.830> to

secondary linebacking corps are not to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
mention the deep pass rush they have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
mention the deep pass rush they have
coming<00:01:22.080> at<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> need<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> truly<00:01:23.159> make

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
coming at you you need to truly make

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.210 
coming at you you need to truly make
them<00:01:23.729> honor<00:01:24.200> two<00:01:25.200> different<00:01:25.619> things<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.100> an

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
them honor two different things as an

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
them honor two different things as an
offense<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> ability<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> pass<00:01:27.450> any<00:01:27.750> ability

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
offense the ability to pass any ability

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
offense the ability to pass any ability
to<00:01:28.439> run<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to run and I think that's going to be

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
to run and I think that's going to be
key<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> Saints<00:01:31.140> establishing<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> run

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
key for the Saints establishing the run

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.999 
key for the Saints establishing the run
so<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> open<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> play-action<00:01:34.470> pass

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
so you can open up the play-action pass

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
so you can open up the play-action pass
open<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> deep<00:01:36.270> play-action<00:01:36.689> pass<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
open up the deep play-action pass and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.039 
open up the deep play-action pass and
also<00:01:37.979> give<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.909> defense<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> little<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
also give your defense a little bit of a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
also give your defense a little bit of a
break<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> Saints<00:01:41.220> defense<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.329> they

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
break this is a Saints defense that they

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.819 
break this is a Saints defense that they
came<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> heck<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> an

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
came up with I think with a heck of an

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
came up with I think with a heck of an
effort<00:01:43.920> last<00:01:44.280> week<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.180> they're<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.390> thin

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
effort last week but they're very thin

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530 
effort last week but they're very thin
right<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.079> they're<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.430> they've<00:01:48.240> been

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right now they're very they've been

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
right now they're very they've been
suffering<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.380> injuries<00:01:49.680> particularly

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
suffering a lot of injuries particularly

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
suffering a lot of injuries particularly
on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> defensive<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> ball<00:01:51.560> okay<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
on the defensive side of the ball okay I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
on the defensive side of the ball okay I
think<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> game<00:01:53.549> where<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> Kenny

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
think this is the game where that Kenny

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020 
think this is the game where that Kenny
Vacarro<00:01:54.810> injury<00:01:55.320> may<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.740> hurt<00:01:56.009> them<00:01:56.250> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Vacarro injury may really hurt them but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
Vacarro injury may really hurt them but
in<00:01:57.299> general<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> thin

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
in general you know when you have a thin

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.270 
in general you know when you have a thin
defense<00:01:59.610> especially<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.259> end<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
defense especially in that back end it's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
defense especially in that back end it's
important<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:03.000> offense<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.659> times<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
important that your offense at times you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
important that your offense at times you
know<00:02:04.409> take<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.430> clock<00:02:05.460> gives

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
know take some time off the clock gives

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.479 
know take some time off the clock gives
you<00:02:06.060> some<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.479> rest<00:02:07.009> especially<00:02:08.009> when

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you some time to rest especially when

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.979 
you some time to rest especially when
you're<00:02:08.670> playing<00:02:08.940> against<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> Seattle<00:02:09.780> team

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you're playing against the Seattle team

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.040 
you're playing against the Seattle team
this<00:02:10.200> week<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.569> very

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
this week that you know is very very

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.820 
this week that you know is very very
physical

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
physical

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
physical
okay<00:02:14.280> they're<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.730> come<00:02:14.850> out<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.210> try

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
okay they're going to come out and try

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.870 
okay they're going to come out and try
to<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> same<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> saints<00:02:17.700> what

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
to do with the same to the saints what

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.460 
to do with the same to the saints what
the<00:02:18.000> saints<00:02:18.330> did<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> Eagles<00:02:19.080> last<00:02:19.260> week

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the saints did to the Eagles last week

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
the saints did to the Eagles last week
get<00:02:19.980> physical<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> point<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.880> attack<00:02:20.970> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
get physical at the point of attack and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.840 
get physical at the point of attack and
push<00:02:21.990> them<00:02:22.230> around<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.190> wears<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
push them around and that wears on a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.390 
push them around and that wears on a
defense<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.440> longer<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.070> Saints

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
defense so I think the longer the Saints

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.460 
defense so I think the longer the Saints
can<00:02:26.610> develop<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.300> steady<00:02:27.540> running<00:02:27.900> game<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
can develop a steady running game the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
can develop a steady running game the
longer<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.220> stay<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> game<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
longer they can stay in the game and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.840 
longer they can stay in the game and
obviously<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:32.040> biggest<00:02:32.220> factor<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
obviously the biggest factor for the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490 
obviously the biggest factor for the
scenes<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> drew<00:02:33.600> brees<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.200> point

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
scenes is that drew brees is on point

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.370 
scenes is that drew brees is on point
and<00:02:34.820> he<00:02:35.820> didn't<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.360> best<00:02:36.570> game<00:02:36.870> against

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and he didn't have the best game against

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
and he didn't have the best game against
Seattle<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.190> first<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.670> around<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
Seattle the first time around which is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.090 
Seattle the first time around which is
well<00:02:39.480> documented<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.740> remember<00:02:40.920> in

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
well documented you have to remember in

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.860 
well documented you have to remember in
that<00:02:41.250> game<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.790> 17<00:02:42.240> nothing<00:02:42.570> at<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> end

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that game it was 17 nothing at the end

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690 
that game it was 17 nothing at the end
of<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> first<00:02:43.230> quarter<00:02:43.470> after<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.400> had<00:02:44.550> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
of the first quarter after you had that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.340 
of the first quarter after you had that
strip<00:02:45.120> sack<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> Michael<00:02:46.080> Bennett

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
strip sack and the Michael Bennett

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.780 
strip sack and the Michael Bennett
return<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> touchdown<00:02:47.070> there<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
return for a touchdown there in the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.880 
return for a touchdown there in the
first<00:02:48.000> quarter<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.870> felt<00:02:49.170> things<00:02:49.410> started<00:02:49.770> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
first quarter you felt things started to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.350 
first quarter you felt things started to
snowball<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.640> Saints<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.180> why<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
snowball on the Saints that's why I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.850 
snowball on the Saints that's why I
think<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> running<00:02:52.080> game<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.320> important<00:02:52.770> for

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
think the running game is important for

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.760 
think the running game is important for
them<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.090> stabilize<00:02:54.090> things<00:02:54.390> early<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
them to stabilize things early get that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.590 
them to stabilize things early get that
crowd<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.850> know<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.090> very<00:02:57.209> hard<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
crowd you know I know it's very hard to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.420 
crowd you know I know it's very hard to
control<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.080> crowd<00:02:58.410> okay<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.190> saying

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
control that crowd okay I'm not saying

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
control that crowd okay I'm not saying
they're<00:02:59.610> gonna<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.180> know<00:03:00.300> stop<00:03:00.570> cheering<00:03:00.900> at

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
they're gonna you know stop cheering at

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
they're gonna you know stop cheering at
the<00:03:01.320> saints<00:03:01.709> go<00:03:01.800> up<00:03:01.920> 7-nothing<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:02.760> do

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the saints go up 7-nothing but do

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.390 
the saints go up 7-nothing but do
something<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:04.230> sort<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.590> quelf<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.070> crowd

something to sort of quelf that crowd

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.330 
something to sort of quelf that crowd
and<00:03:05.670> stabilize<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.570> game<00:03:06.900> early<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.950> Saints

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and stabilize the game early that Saints

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.000 
and stabilize the game early that Saints
defense<00:03:08.820> against<00:03:09.330> Seattle's<00:03:09.900> offense<00:03:10.440> look

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
defense against Seattle's offense look

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
defense against Seattle's offense look
Seattle<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> first<00:03:12.000> game<00:03:12.240> especially

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
Seattle in the first game especially

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.870 
Seattle in the first game especially
Marshawn<00:03:13.800> Lynch<00:03:14.070> had<00:03:14.250> trouble<00:03:14.580> running<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
Marshawn Lynch had trouble running the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120 
Marshawn Lynch had trouble running the
football<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.630> 16<00:03:16.020> carries<00:03:16.320> for<00:03:16.650> 45

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
football I think was 16 carries for 45

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.729 
football I think was 16 carries for 45
yards<00:03:17.510> will<00:03:18.510> kill<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> Saints<00:03:19.200> defense<00:03:19.590> in

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
yards will kill the Saints defense in

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.380 
yards will kill the Saints defense in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
45 yards in that game as well so it was

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.660 
45 yards in that game as well so it was
a<00:03:31.260> weird<00:03:31.470> case<00:03:31.680> where<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.310> know<00:03:32.459> they

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
a weird case where you know they

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.940 
a weird case where you know they
controlled<00:03:33.120> Marshawn<00:03:33.630> Lynch<00:03:33.959> but<00:03:34.620> couldn't

controlled Marshawn Lynch but couldn't

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.310 
controlled Marshawn Lynch but couldn't
really<00:03:35.100> contain<00:03:35.459> Russell<00:03:35.880> Wilson<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
lineman ready to go obviously the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.420 
lineman ready to go obviously the
biggest<00:03:57.660> factor<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.260> being<00:03:58.860> Marshawn

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
biggest factor in that being Marshawn

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
biggest factor in that being Marshawn
Lynch<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.690> know<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> Saints<00:04:01.170> defense

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
Lynch and you know the Saints defense

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.050 
Lynch and you know the Saints defense
again<00:04:01.709> last<00:04:01.980> week<00:04:02.220> versus<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.580> Eagles<00:04:02.880> did<00:04:03.000> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
again last week versus the Eagles did a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.060 
again last week versus the Eagles did a
very<00:04:03.180> good<00:04:03.330> job<00:04:03.480> against<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.019> run<00:04:04.230> stopping

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
very good job against the run stopping

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.150 
very good job against the run stopping
the<00:04:05.100> run<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:06.350> running<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.440> ball<00:04:07.590> themselves

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the run and running the ball themselves

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.400 
the run and running the ball themselves
I<00:04:08.250> think<00:04:08.610> crucial<00:04:09.090> especially<00:04:09.870> given<00:04:10.380> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
I think crucial especially given the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
I think crucial especially given the
circumstance<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.310> going<00:04:11.880> up<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.150> place

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
circumstance of going up to a place

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.060 
circumstance of going up to a place
where<00:04:13.019> everything<00:04:13.560> else<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.799> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.950> be

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
where everything else is going to be

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.770 
where everything else is going to be
against<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.549> whether<00:04:14.820> it's<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.269> crowd<00:04:15.510> noise

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
against you whether it's the crowd noise

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.469 
against you whether it's the crowd noise
but<00:04:16.320> more<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.620> top<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.370> very<00:04:17.940> deep<00:04:18.239> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
but more on top of that a very deep and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.810 
but more on top of that a very deep and
talented<00:04:18.600> Seahawks<00:04:19.320> roster<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.040> worry<00:04:20.700> about

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
talented Seahawks roster I worry about

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.390 
talented Seahawks roster I worry about
you<00:04:21.299> know<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.570> Saints<00:04:22.080> hanging<00:04:22.800> early<00:04:23.190> and

you know the Saints hanging early and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.040 
you know the Saints hanging early and
then<00:04:23.700> over<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.090> course<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.630> game<00:04:24.810> with

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
then over the course of the game with

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.770 
then over the course of the game with
the<00:04:25.169> depth<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.590> Seahawks<00:04:25.979> have<00:04:26.250> all<00:04:26.880> right

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
the depth of Seahawks have all right

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
the depth of Seahawks have all right
purely<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.770> defensive<00:04:29.220> side<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> ball

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
purely on the defensive side of the ball

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.010 
purely on the defensive side of the ball
with<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> way<00:04:30.420> they're<00:04:30.570> going<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.780> be<00:04:30.840> running

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
with the way they're going to be running

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.020 
with the way they're going to be running
the<00:04:31.170> ball<00:04:31.320> aggressively<00:04:31.980> I<00:04:32.190> where<00:04:32.820> that's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
the ball aggressively I where that's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.430 
the ball aggressively I where that's
going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.240> sort<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.600> wear<00:04:33.780> on<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.020> Saints<00:04:34.350> and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
going to sort of wear on the Saints and

you look at the seahawks defense and you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360 
you look at the seahawks defense and you
think<00:04:39.930> well<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:41.010> is<00:04:41.130> like<00:04:41.250> an

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
think well this is this is like an

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.420 
think well this is this is like an
impenetrable<00:04:41.790> unit<00:04:42.450> one<00:04:43.350> spot<00:04:43.740> I'd<00:04:43.980> be<00:04:44.160> wary

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
impenetrable unit one spot I'd be wary

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.700 
impenetrable unit one spot I'd be wary
of<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.300> fact<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.630> KJ<00:04:46.110> Wright<00:04:46.410> in<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
first game pretty much shadow Jimmy

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.750

does<00:05:51.510> he<00:05:51.720> dedicate<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.200> spy<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.620> Wilson<00:05:53.250> when<00:05:53.430> he

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
does he dedicate a spy to Wilson when he

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.340 
does he dedicate a spy to Wilson when he
rolls<00:05:53.729> outside<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.300> pocket<00:05:54.510> which<00:05:55.080> can<00:05:55.260> be

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
rolls outside the pocket which can be

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.860 
rolls outside the pocket which can be
dangerous<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.979> do<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:56.940> effectively<00:05:57.479> was<00:05:57.660> done

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
dangerous to do but effectively was done

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.110 
dangerous to do but effectively was done
the<00:05:57.990> right<00:05:58.140> way<00:05:58.200> look<00:05:59.070> for<00:05:59.250> Curtis<00:05:59.550> Lofton<00:05:59.760> to

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
the right way look for Curtis Lofton to

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.270 
the right way look for Curtis Lofton to
have<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.270> big<00:06:00.539> impact<00:06:00.690> on<00:06:01.080> this<00:06:01.260> game<00:06:01.380> both<00:06:02.039> in

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
have a big impact on this game both in

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.190 
have a big impact on this game both in
the<00:06:02.460> running<00:06:02.760> game<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.150> also<00:06:03.660> containing

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
the running game and also containing

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.690 
the running game and also containing
Russell<00:06:04.620> Wilson<00:06:04.979> when<00:06:05.070> he<00:06:05.130> gets<00:06:05.310> outside<00:06:05.460> the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
Russell Wilson when he gets outside the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.240 
Russell Wilson when he gets outside the
pocket<00:06:06.000> and<00:06:06.390> overall<00:06:07.320> I<00:06:07.530> think<00:06:07.890> this<00:06:08.039> is<00:06:08.160> going

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
pocket and overall I think this is going

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.510 
pocket and overall I think this is going
to<00:06:08.340> be<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.460> very<00:06:08.520> good<00:06:08.940> game<00:06:09.120> especially<00:06:09.690> early

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
to be a very good game especially early

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.620 
to be a very good game especially early
because<00:06:11.520> I<00:06:11.669> don't<00:06:12.000> think<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.270> saints<00:06:12.479> are

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
because I don't think the saints are

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.670 
because I don't think the saints are
going<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.840> go<00:06:12.900> in<00:06:13.020> there<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.200> make<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.500> same

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
going to go in there and make the same

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.610 
going to go in there and make the same
mistakes<00:06:14.039> earlier<00:06:14.460> they<00:06:14.700> did<00:06:14.940> in<00:06:15.330> week<00:06:15.630> 13<00:06:15.840> but

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
mistakes earlier they did in week 13 but

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.409 
mistakes earlier they did in week 13 but
I<00:06:16.680> think<00:06:16.890> eventually<00:06:17.130> the<00:06:17.789> punishment<00:06:18.390> that

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
I think eventually the punishment that

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.420 
I think eventually the punishment that
physically<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.289> saints<00:06:19.650> well<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.220> will

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
physically that the saints well I will

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.430 
physically that the saints well I will
incur<00:06:20.760> on<00:06:20.940> both<00:06:21.150> sides<00:06:21.479> of<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.780> ball<00:06:21.990> by<00:06:22.229> this

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
incur on both sides of the ball by this

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.860 
incur on both sides of the ball by this
rested<00:06:22.950> Seahawks<00:06:23.400> team<00:06:23.700> I<00:06:23.940> think<00:06:24.570> will<00:06:24.690> win

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
rested Seahawks team I think will win

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.529

out<00:06:24.900> in<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.200> end<00:06:25.289> and<00:06:25.740> I<00:06:25.770> like<00:06:26.729> you<00:06:27.270> know<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.479> I

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
out in the end and I like you know and I

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.570 
out in the end and I like you know and I
look<00:06:27.720> for<00:06:27.900> this<00:06:27.990> to<00:06:28.200> be<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.530> Russell<00:06:29.220> Wilson

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
look for this to be a Russell Wilson

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.790 
look for this to be a Russell Wilson
performance<00:06:30.180> that<00:06:30.810> will<00:06:30.930> put<00:06:31.200> him<00:06:31.229> even<00:06:31.650> more

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
performance that will put him even more

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.500 
performance that will put him even more

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
game I like Seattle minus the seven and

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.910 
game I like Seattle minus the seven and
a<00:06:39.419> half<00:06:39.450> at<00:06:40.080> home<00:06:40.409> to<00:06:40.620> wait

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
a half at home to wait

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.260 
a half at home to wait
and<00:06:41.040> advance<00:06:41.580> the<00:06:41.820> conference<00:06:42.210> championship

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
and advance the conference championship

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.630 
and advance the conference championship
I<00:06:43.050> just<00:06:43.590> think<00:06:43.710> the<00:06:43.860> Saints<00:06:44.160> had<00:06:44.280> their<00:06:44.490> great

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
I just think the Saints had their great

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.870 
I just think the Saints had their great
game<00:06:44.970> last<00:06:45.000> week<00:06:45.530> and<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:47.100> don't<00:06:47.520> see<00:06:47.700> them

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
game last week and I don't see them

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.040 
game last week and I don't see them
being<00:06:48.030> able<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.390> run<00:06:48.570> the<00:06:48.600> ball<00:06:48.690> effectively

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050
