blade<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.110> thumb<00:00:46.320> even<00:00:46.590> though<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.770> looks

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
blade with my thumb even though it looks

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.060 
blade with my thumb even though it looks
like<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.879> should<00:00:51.829> start<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> pull

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
like it and that should start to pull

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.540 
like it and that should start to pull
away<00:00:53.870> okay<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:55.890> we've<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.100> five

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
away okay you can see we've got five

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
away okay you can see we've got five
wires<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.590> you've<00:00:58.590> got<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> copper<00:00:59.039> colored

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
wires here you've got the copper colored

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.950 
wires here you've got the copper colored
one<00:00:59.629> that's<00:01:00.629> our<00:01:00.840> ground<00:01:02.570> point<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one that's our ground point it with the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.290 
one that's our ground point it with the
stanley<00:01:04.290> knife<00:01:04.410> blade<00:01:04.910> we've<00:01:05.910> got<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.120> red

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
stanley knife blade we've got the red

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.260

which<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.420> twisted<00:01:15.750> together

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
which are twisted together

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
which are twisted together
that's<00:01:17.009> our<00:01:17.220> ground<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> speaker's<00:01:20.119> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that's our ground for the speaker's this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
that's our ground for the speaker's this
ground<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.549> we're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
ground here is the one we're going to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.380 
ground here is the one we're going to
use<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> mic<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.520> doing<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
use for the mic all I'm doing now is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
use for the mic all I'm doing now is
taking<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.960> string<00:01:29.570> cut<00:01:30.570> into<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> need

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
taking the string cut into it now I need

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.830 
taking the string cut into it now I need
to<00:01:32.520> tell<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> our<00:01:32.970> solder<00:01:33.479> time<00:01:35.630> I've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to tell you our solder time I've got a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730 
to tell you our solder time I've got a
reasonably<00:01:37.320> small<00:01:37.409> tip<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.740> we'll

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
reasonably small tip on this one we'll

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.550 
reasonably small tip on this one we'll
just<00:01:40.920> let<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.189> heat<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> temperature<00:01:42.560> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
just let that heat up the temperature so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460 
just let that heat up the temperature so
the<00:01:43.649> first<00:01:43.890> thing<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.159> need<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:46.320> rid

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the first thing we need to do is get rid

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
the first thing we need to do is get rid
of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.090> insulation<00:01:48.649> by<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.890> heating<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> up

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
of the insulation by just heating it up

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.930 
of the insulation by just heating it up
with<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.390> tip<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.810> solder<00:01:52.049> name

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.840 

I'll<00:01:58.940> burn<00:01:59.210> away<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.990> varnish<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.740> we<00:02:01.700> can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I'll burn away the varnish so we can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.380 
I'll burn away the varnish so we can
actually<00:02:01.940> get<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> contact<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:08.090> need<00:02:08.300> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
actually get a contact now we need to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.160 
actually get a contact now we need to
prepare<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.869> wires<00:02:10.570> you're<00:02:11.570> looking<00:02:11.930> through

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
prepare the wires you're looking through

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.250 
prepare the wires you're looking through
the<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.770> lens<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> pair<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.490> helping<00:02:13.940> hands

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the the lens on a pair of helping hands

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.610 
the the lens on a pair of helping hands
just<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.350> make<00:02:15.530> things<00:02:15.710> bigger<00:02:17.320> all<00:02:18.320> I'm<00:02:18.470> going

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
just to make things bigger all I'm going

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.040 
just to make things bigger all I'm going
to<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.840> my<00:02:20.990> hands<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> bit<00:02:21.440> steadier

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
to do which my hands are a bit steadier

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:42.790 
to do which my hands are a bit steadier
is<00:02:24.050> tin<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.180 

now<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:43.860> need<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> prepare<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.670> plug<00:02:46.190> by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
now we need to prepare the plug by

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.460 
now we need to prepare the plug by
putting<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.610> small<00:02:47.790> amount<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.630> solder<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.320> each

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
putting a small amount of solder on each

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.970 
putting a small amount of solder on each
of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> connection<00:02:50.220> points<00:02:54.740> careful<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:55.890> you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
of the connection points careful if you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.800 
of the connection points careful if you
get<00:02:56.070> too<00:02:56.280> hot<00:02:56.490> because<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.180> plastic<00:02:57.630> will

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
get too hot because the the plastic will

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.030 
get too hot because the the plastic will
melt<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:01.350> all<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.830> do<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.300> at<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.480> time

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
melt so all going to do is one at a time

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.670 
melt so all going to do is one at a time
lay<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.220> tinned<00:03:05.720> wire<00:03:06.720> over<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> connection

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
lay the tinned wire over the connection

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
then we'll drop a pic the piece of heat

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.840 
then we'll drop a pic the piece of heat
shrink<00:03:56.020> tubing<00:03:56.740> over<00:03:57.960> there<00:03:59.640> which<00:04:00.640> will

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
knocked under rolling it in the heat

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:22.590 
knocked under rolling it in the heat
there<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.180> go

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.840 

we'll<00:04:23.600> bring<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:29.630> outer<00:04:29.810> case<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.699> the
