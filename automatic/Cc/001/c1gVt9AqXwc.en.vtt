00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.630
 beautiful good evening everyone hello 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.040
 many of you most up here 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 You can watch youtube whistling videos 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.300
 yes to the enjoyment of people themselves 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.050
 intense with her hobby 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.930
 argue and know a lot about 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.350
 whistle and whistle over and over 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.330
 Tobacco and the story and so on 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 and yet I think if I ever do that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 ask what's the problem? 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.469
 oldest still existing whistles 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.020
 then factory or whistle company 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.420
 many come to ponder 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 or what can that be? 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.219
 might think of sang claude in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 france there was something 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.870
 they were the first ones and sang 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 Claude is the world capital of the world 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.170
 Whistles have been macherey 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 and indeed the company aco from this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.050
 this consisted of this great house 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.619
 looks back on a history in the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.850
 year 1780 has started that's already 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 a bit of history and yet it is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 not and none of those with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.619
 big names we still really today 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 know well 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 Maybe this leads us here too 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 a bridge had first time in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.259
 literal senses on the wood path 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.759
 because if we think back or in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.790
 our memory kramen 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.920
 then probably a human falls to us 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 The first whistles in Europe are hiking 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 could woodpipes that can only 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.009
 later, but the first whistle 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 Those were the ones made of clay 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.930
 that is baked 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.509
 like this beautiful tune for here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 still smoked a handmade clay 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.329
 whistles that looked typical 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.250
 kathi head so kathi shape with these 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.799
 tap down there originally as times 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.310
 Tray for protection of the table wood 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.470
 or something served 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.460
 these were the first plants from which 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.520
 was smoked 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.590
 many many hundreds of years and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 in fact , the company on the me too 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 In addition, that was initially one 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.470
 whistle bakery in the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.650
 Dutch gouda one of the central 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.720
 places in the eighteenth and nineteenth 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 century for clay pipes so in the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.170
 dutch gouda or the company zenit 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.180
 founded by peter jan van der wand and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.080
 this company actually exists until 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.390
 Today, they have clay pipes 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.850
 made but and after 150 years 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.299
 as they have now developed the whole 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.670
 system continued and they started whistling 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.950
 also from porcelain and produce it 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.489
 I would even imagine today so 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.099
 a porcelain whistle maybe 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.319
 think if we hear porcelain yes rather 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.720
 so on this tradition and stuck 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.299
 Partying with porcelain heads 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.440
 painted and usually less 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.660
 suitable for smoking than being so 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.359
 jewelry as wandschmuck or room 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.370
 and some take themselves as souvenir 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.049
 from your holidays with their only in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.160
 southern Germany or wherever in 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.019
 Austria or so whistle to these 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.060
 Many think when they whistle porcelain 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.480
 Listen and it 's really just the question 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.910
 if they actually smoke well too 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.950
 that's what they whistle with 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.560
 otherwise these are actually full-fledged 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.389
 building equipment and probably will 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.130
 Many people have such a porcelain 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.319
 whistle how should we do that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.630
 probably hot and hot 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.750
 in principle this is also a problem of 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.889
 porcelain whistle but the company zenit 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.269
 has a new development in 1920 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.280
 I want to try this here 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.540
 so in the picture to show I do not know if 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.930
 that can see well 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.390
 These whistles have a cavity one 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.170
 can this recognize something in the picture 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.380
 the whistling chamber the combustion chamber 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.209
 The tobacco does not close directly on the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.340
 whistle head but there is one 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.590
 cavity or in this cavity can 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.760
 the robbery to circulate next 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.780
 and can cool down and get there first 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.570
 then in the mouth of the pleasure smoker and 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.360
 it 's actually like this whistling 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.890
 really good to smoke and are 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.020
 if you do consume some 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.810
 understand then they will not be hot 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.660
 they will stay cool with the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.910
 whistling head warms up to a maximum hand 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.500
 warm as it should be and so on 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.990
 it will also be from our breaks 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.220
 wooden pipes know the company zenit 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.610
 continues to produce as I said 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.640
 the most famous series from kauder 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.120
 come is the olt mans series 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.740
 and there are different types again 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.540
 For example, there is a series under 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.450
 the name amsterdam is rather something 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.430
 bigger whistles and then here this me 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.550
 do not know if you can read this 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.660
 it's named manhattan i know 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.400
 not if you can see 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.740
 so you have to believe me so 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.590
 Manhattan, that's a bit smaller 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.340
 Shapes but as I said really good 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.240
 smoking tires whistles whistle that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.860
 Mouthpiece is not kept in one 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.960
 basket or as we like it from more 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.830
 stripes, for example, but know 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.479
 Here is a rubber ring in it there 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.390
 sometimes in black or now here in 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.280
 white and thus the mouthpiece 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:42.669
 really good on the whistle 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.530
 attach yes there is also a whole 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.990
 great and will look the beautiful 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.229
 series that means black magic there that is 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.180
 porcelain then black colored this 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.490
 I still have whistles to buy today 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.320
 I'll post a link to the company below 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.220
 to set the video description 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.010
 and who cares 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.750
 At this mature who is for it 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.160
 I am interested in that 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.840
 look the side and maybe find 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.930
 he actually does something he likes me 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.670
 better like to order as I said 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.320
 good usable whistling in the white 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.360
 Incidentally, the special is that the 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.050
 Similar to more foam whistling in the run 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.690
 darken the time a bit and also one 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.700
 to accept certain colouration 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.830
 that can be quite interesting and 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.330
 is not always predictable how 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.230
 because then this drawing one day 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.000
 it will be so exciting 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.090
 as he already fall here where the 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.570
 porcelain whistle significantly cheaper 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.450
 are so much so our little 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.050
 trip to holland in the city ​​of blue 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:51.260
 to four times zenith Peter jan van der 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.669
 wall the oldest still existing today 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.320
 whistle factory of the world 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.419
 I think I forgot to say 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.080
 when this company was founded 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:02.930
 well it's 31 years of research so im 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.080
 year 1749 is been 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.880
 as long as continuous whistling production 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.290
 that wants to mean something that should 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.750
 also be rewarded so on 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.190
 website and who has lust 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.650
 As I said, sometimes something can happen 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.650
 order by then see you
