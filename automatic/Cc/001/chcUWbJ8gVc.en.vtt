00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 there we are again a new consequence new 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.010
 luck call of duty something softer on the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.010
 playstation 4 grade is loading 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.109
 I'm on the fields 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.609
 oh yeah so last we talk about 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 let the future be over the present 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.480
 turn over this smart watch 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 Is that someday the smartphones 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 replace 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 in my opinion no because that we 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.480
 a step backwards 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.010
 right now is so trend is that the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.960
 display size of the mobile phone getting bigger 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.820
 that means in the future the will 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 trouser pockets are always bigger 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 I think not only that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 sometime smartphone completely replaced 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.510
 unfortunately something is on the display 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.739
 size changed or the dis the display 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.149
 is depicted in a kind of hologram 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.640
 and then I want to say that's it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.130
 somehow blatantly or that is somehow 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.010
 crap 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:17.009
 because we say you sit in the bus and toilet 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.810
 Seeing a garden picture will somehow become one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.689
 picture from last night at the party 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
 look at you from your colleagues where 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.150
 you really drunk and shit 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 have made or you live photos 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 was sent drunk what and 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.210
 Women's clothes attracted hate and such 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.190
 will's just not that all is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 that will notice 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.730
 and if that were such a hologram then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 That's why he has to 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.360
 give something that you only from the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 position the picture at the beginning 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 if you just look at the clocks and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.010
 the clock on it has that not everyone that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.690
 can look at 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.690
 You have to combine that again 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.010
 possibly with a pair of glasses or with something 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.470
 other things with a pair of glasses would be yes 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.270
 bad then because you want too 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.340
 want others to be guests and then 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 is there not even a clock from Bremen and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.190
 I think in general I ask myself 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 Currently what do you need such a smart 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.960
 watch that awesome a lot again 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.920
 battery time 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.150
 The benefit is not clear to me for that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.150
 you do not need quite agree that needs 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.860
 Not if you have a cell phone that is 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 only for people who are too lazy and around 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 your cellphone out of your pocket and something 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.990
 look around smart watch already gave 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.320
 earlier where i got the on experience zx 10 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.760
 there was already smart watch else 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
 also as with a combine and the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.830
 probably on the clock, for example, something on display 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.980
 twitter was just posted on what 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.739
 facebook is posted and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.150
 sms messages he was only shown 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.590
 do not mind us also make custom 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.270
 few things displayed and the time 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:03.020
 of course, mÃ¤rklin must 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.020
 the akg meters off 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.840
 any one of us, yes, maidservant goes 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:17.490
 from time to cool combo from next 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.240
 near as he knows the place I stop 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.220
 not or can not do it for a long time 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.210
 So follow me 70 or so I have the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.210
 finally get to know me 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.110
 better late than never 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.030
 have you been in the smart watch that would 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.250
 I am interested in a smart today 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.990
 watch or think the bob has 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.280
 no sense right now or he gives 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.690
 No sense at all of this smart watch 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.820
 or do the company just because 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.730
 you do not use cellphone technology 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.430
 come on, maybe come 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.930
 really not currently on 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.480
 a place where it is easy 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.620
 they can not go any further 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.010
 perfecting are already in the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.000
 perfect fortis l fund rainbow he will 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.000
 really interest me 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.950
 why and there we do not want something 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.890
 sure is something and also an open one 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.170
 should be secret is that everyone 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.780
 manufacturer already the next but one next 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.359
 mobile phone in stock and has just arrived 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.950
 produce is so there is already 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.720
 determined at apple in the camp the iphone 8 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.330
 maybe just a prototype 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.580
 probably 80 percent finished 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.310
 but they are already loose so far 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.870
 synonymous samsung sony is so far synonymous 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.060
 all mobile phone companies 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.620
 although sony does not want sony anymore 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.720
 We said we're tired 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.650
 or we finally want to 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.040
 We make a profit again 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.480
 Focus on things that run 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.050
 laptop so sony vaio 's yes synonymous 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.950
 no longer for example then said no 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.290
 too much competition smartphone 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.600
 Although we make super smartphones my 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:09.090
 opinion after I own yes a sony 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.090
 That's why I can say something about it 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.170
 So in my opinion, the phones are 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.550
 beautiful 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.950
 Of course, everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.530
 decide just because I do something makes 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:29.020
 not what you like that only the ones say 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.760
 The mobile phone industry is also for 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.580
 us not so important resp 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.270
 they came no weight more us 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.480
 are no longer even heavily publicized 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.220
 there he is so trends there are yes 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.290
 Two brands in the mobile phone market 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.340
 he also tries to dominate microsoft 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:53.370
 his luck microsoft also tries to be 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.370
 good luck with the windows phone 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.790
 everyone can try their luck 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.470
 if you come in nice if not 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:09.310
 then the classic way has gone or 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:13.020
 become active too late the problem of 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.020
 Spanish cell phones are too expensive 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.130
 So I mean too expensive with this 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.620
 not everyone knows sony or not everyone 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.810
 has ever heard sony phone eight he belonged 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.880
 not to thank 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.840
 Now we did not have sony cellphone 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.580
 and that's why I believe that one 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.880
 would not change if the newest 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.990
 sony comes out if any new one 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.250
 Handy comes out of the brand you 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.570
 never used then you are so yes then 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.920
 I prefer to take what I have before 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.580
 but did not like that one 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:51.600
 like it then you change that gives the 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.260
 hit something again too late 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.150
 I think I need a few 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.150
 mike I have currently not on it 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.030
 damned no matter lost 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:22.530
 by philipp traitor traitors no matter how 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.040
 The next time you have a nice day 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.040
 bye
