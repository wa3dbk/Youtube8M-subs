00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:39.059
 in one level done on meter she 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 peel off here you see the certificate 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.500
 Ukrainian is the oil officially imported 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.649
 On the territory of Ukraine there is also a number 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 Ukrainian inscriptions here that this means 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.559
 This means that the oil is made for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.730
 Ukraine, the company castrol periodically 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 doing fuel analysis and specificity 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.350
 our fuel is customized 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.569
 molecular structure oil which 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 is exported to one or another country in 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.920
 In this case, in Ukraine, therefore, we 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 We recommend to buy exactly Ukrainian 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.159
 oils it makes no sense to buy German oils 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 or American and we must take exactly 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.530
 what is really made under 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.219
 Ukraine is closer to our fuels 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 a little bit if i show you see in 500 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.930
 times the cam surface 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.590
 and if you hold your finger is rough 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 surface 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.750
 worn and this surface when 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.840
 using magnatec oils she 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.789
 glossy it means that it is butter 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.080
 really contributes to your 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.420
 engine is long and high quality 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.490
 But on this oil I would like to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.730
 a little stop at the tolerances of this 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.930
 oils have American tolerance 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.220
 Institute of Oil of the USSR there is an admission and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.480
 European Association 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.100
 automakers a3 b3 and a3 b4 have 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.090
 admission bmw longlife-01 have admission seat 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.790

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.530
 general motors 025 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.200
 and b 0 25 and the tolerance mersedes 229.3 is 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.290
 Renault tolerance for xenon and yes 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.800
 volkswagen hellish tolerances 500 200 and 500 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.750
 50 I would like to note that the molecules 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.650
 castrol magnatec attracted to detail 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 engine like a magnet forming a steady 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.900
 protective layer saved this layer 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.030
 starting from the first second of work 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 engine and stands up later 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 engine start combined 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.670
 synthetic technology 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.160
 provides enhanced protection and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.220
 high and low temperatures work 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.489
 engine this oil is always in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.910
