now what I have done is I have created

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.909 
now what I have done is I have created
composited<00:00:23.689> pictures<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.259> be<00:00:24.349> able<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:24.560> create

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
composited pictures to be able to create

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.640 
composited pictures to be able to create
a<00:00:24.949> smile<00:00:25.460> line<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:26.449> tell<00:00:26.720> me<00:00:26.840> exactly<00:00:26.960> where<00:00:27.560> we

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
a smile line to tell me exactly where we

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.589 
a smile line to tell me exactly where we
want<00:00:27.829> to<00:00:27.919> remove<00:00:28.189> tissue<00:00:28.399> and<00:00:28.820> where<00:00:29.329> we<00:00:29.419> want

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
want to remove tissue and where we want

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.599 
want to remove tissue and where we want
to<00:00:29.660> keep<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.930> tissue<00:00:30.109> intact<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.369> now<00:00:31.489> we're

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
to keep the tissue intact so now we're

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.639 
to keep the tissue intact so now we're
going<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.759> begin<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.090> laser<00:00:32.449> sequence<00:00:32.989> watch

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
going to begin the laser sequence watch

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.830 
going to begin the laser sequence watch
where<00:00:33.949> I'm<00:00:34.010> going<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.280> remove<00:00:34.550> more<00:00:34.790> tissue<00:00:35.420> in

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
where I'm going to remove more tissue in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.380 
where I'm going to remove more tissue in
the<00:00:36.140> premolar<00:00:36.620> area<00:00:37.040> after<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> sound<00:00:38.269> the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the premolar area after I sound the

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.000 
the premolar area after I sound the
tissue<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.809> bone<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.290> make<00:00:39.440> sure<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.739> we<00:00:39.860> can

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
tissue to bone to make sure that we can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.729 
tissue to bone to make sure that we can
remove<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.400> tissue<00:00:40.550> adequately<00:00:41.739> when

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
remove the tissue adequately when

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.079 
remove the tissue adequately when
sounding<00:00:43.220> we're<00:00:43.400> getting<00:00:43.699> to<00:00:43.850> four

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
sounding we're getting to four

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.910 
sounding we're getting to four
millimeters<00:00:44.329> which<00:00:44.839> allows<00:00:45.199> about<00:00:45.620> one

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
millimeters which allows about one

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.259 
millimeters which allows about one
millimeter<00:00:46.370> of<00:00:46.460> gingival<00:00:47.089> reduction

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
millimeter of gingival reduction

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.250 
millimeter of gingival reduction
anything<00:00:50.269> more<00:00:50.480> than<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:50.989> lead<00:00:51.230> to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
anything more than that can lead to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.660 
anything more than that can lead to
biologic<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.189> issues

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.740 

okay<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:55.729> we'll<00:00:56.000> be<00:00:56.119> able<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.360> remove<00:00:56.600> one

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
okay so we'll be able to remove one

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:16.149 
okay so we'll be able to remove one
millimeter<00:00:57.439> of<00:00:57.589> tissue

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.830 

as<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.610> we've<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> position<00:01:18.659> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
as one can see we've got the position of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.710 
as one can see we've got the position of
the<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.590> side<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> patient's<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.490> side

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
the right side a patient's right side

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
the right side a patient's right side
stabilized<00:01:21.720> now<00:01:21.990> we're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
stabilized now we're going to do the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
stabilized now we're going to do the
same<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> left<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.840> reason<00:01:25.350> why<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.830> my

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
same to the left side a reason why in my

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
same to the left side a reason why in my
opinion<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.399> we<00:01:26.640> need<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> spend<00:01:27.210> four<00:01:27.509> hours

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
opinion that we need to spend four hours

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800 
opinion that we need to spend four hours
on<00:01:28.080> preparation<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.039> ten<00:01:29.310> teeth<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
on preparation of ten teeth it is one of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
on preparation of ten teeth it is one of
those<00:01:30.899> things<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.340> found<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.789> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
those things where I have found over the

those things where I have found over the
years<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
years that I just get in and I do it and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
years that I just get in and I do it and
let<00:01:35.220> me<00:01:35.250> explain<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.229> there's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
let me explain that a little bit there's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.570 
let me explain that a little bit there's
some<00:01:37.409> key<00:01:37.590> elements<00:01:37.679> with<00:01:38.100> regard<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
some key elements with regard to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.139 
some key elements with regard to
preparation<00:01:38.970> sequence<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.909> don't<00:01:41.909> use

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
preparation sequence one is don't use

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.179 
preparation sequence one is don't use
the<00:01:42.179> same<00:01:42.299> bird<00:01:42.810> twice<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.500> may<00:01:43.619> seem<00:01:43.860> simple

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the same bird twice it may seem simple

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.749 
the same bird twice it may seem simple
but<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:45.390> any<00:01:45.929> of<00:01:46.110> us<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:47.460> dental<00:01:47.729> school

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
but if any of us from dental school

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.190 
but if any of us from dental school
think<00:01:48.209> back<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> your<00:01:48.569> days<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.869> dental<00:01:49.140> school

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
think back to your days in dental school

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
think back to your days in dental school
and<00:01:49.470> probably<00:01:49.890> many<00:01:50.100> people<00:01:50.429> still<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and probably many people still do this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
and probably many people still do this
is<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.440> what<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> call<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> dink<00:01:53.340> factor

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is you do what I call the dink factor

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
is you do what I call the dink factor
you<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.390> tend<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> burr<00:01:55.319> do<00:01:55.950> something

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you just tend to get a burr do something

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
you just tend to get a burr do something
with<00:01:56.459> it<00:01:56.490> regard<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> tooth<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.539> put<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
with it regard to the tooth you put it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
with it regard to the tooth you put it
down<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.200> bring<00:01:58.709> up<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> next<00:01:59.280> bird<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.789> then

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
down you bring up the next bird and then

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.160 
down you bring up the next bird and then
before<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.659> you've<00:02:00.810> gone<00:02:00.929> through

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
before you know it you've gone through

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
before you know it you've gone through
all<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> birds<00:02:01.709> six<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.159> seven<00:02:02.459> times<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
all the birds six or seven times and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
all the birds six or seven times and
pick<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.750> change<00:02:04.319> them<00:02:04.500> within<00:02:04.679> the

Chuck probably 30 to 40 times on some

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.180 
Chuck probably 30 to 40 times on some
cases<00:02:08.119> well<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.330> say<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.259> start<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:10.950> bird

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
cases well I say you start with one bird

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.910 
cases well I say you start with one bird
go<00:02:11.549> til<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.000> completed<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> your

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
go til it's completed then go to your

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
go til it's completed then go to your
second<00:02:14.400> bird<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.819> my<00:02:15.000> case<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.480> tend<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> do

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
second bird in my case I just tend to do

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.470 
second bird in my case I just tend to do
gross<00:02:16.620> reduction<00:02:17.250> if<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.060> need<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.330> break

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
gross reduction if I need to break

gross reduction if I need to break
contacts<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.170> will<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.769> at<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.340> point

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
contacts I will and I do at some point

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.490 
contacts I will and I do at some point
probably<00:02:20.970> about<00:02:21.329> thirty<00:02:21.660> percent<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.170> time<00:02:22.350> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
probably about thirty percent of time I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.190 
probably about thirty percent of time I
break<00:02:22.709> contacts<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.090> will<00:02:24.359> break<00:02:24.600> contacts

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
break contacts but I will break contacts

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.270 
break contacts but I will break contacts
I<00:02:25.440> will<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.620> large<00:02:28.890> barrel

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
I will then go in with a large barrel

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420 
I will then go in with a large barrel
burr<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:29.880> start<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.900> remove<00:02:30.989> incisal<00:02:31.799> create

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
a lingual bevel facial reduction then I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.849 
a lingual bevel facial reduction then I
move<00:02:35.670> into<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.030> long<00:02:36.480> taper<00:02:36.870> course<00:02:37.320> burr<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
move into a long taper course burr and

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.710 
move into a long taper course burr and
this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.640> important<00:02:39.150> where<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> have

doctors because of the fact that I

feel of the angulation of the bird that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.809

back<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.549> very<00:03:08.609> important<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:10.019> when<00:03:10.260> we

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
back it's very important that when we

were preparing the veneers I use excite
these<00:03:17.280> two<00:03:17.609> brushes<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.269> what<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.569> available

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
these two brushes are what are available

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.440 
these two brushes are what are available
and<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:20.220> bender<00:03:20.639> brush<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> better<00:03:21.239> brush

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and the bender brush is a better brush

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.560 
and the bender brush is a better brush
for<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.720> application<00:03:21.900> versus<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.609> spiky

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
for this application versus the spiky

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.820 
for this application versus the spiky
kind<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.820 

micro<00:03:28.580> brushes<00:03:28.970> micro<00:03:29.330> brushes<00:03:29.720> tend<00:03:30.620> to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
micro brushes micro brushes tend to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.290 
micro brushes micro brushes tend to
elicit<00:03:31.790> some<00:03:33.640> hemorrhaging<00:03:34.640> around<00:03:35.240> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
elicit some hemorrhaging around the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.240 
elicit some hemorrhaging around the
tissue<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.020> I<00:03:36.050> prefer<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.680> use<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.950> bender

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
tissue and so I prefer to use a bender

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100 
tissue and so I prefer to use a bender
brush<00:03:37.430> because<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.880> does<00:03:38.060> not<00:03:38.180> do<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.870> I

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
brush because it does not do that I

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.250 
brush because it does not do that I
definitely<00:03:39.470> put<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:39.980> nice<00:03:42.100> copious<00:03:43.100> amount

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
definitely put a nice copious amount

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.930 
definitely put a nice copious amount
