you try them all and what's best for you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.319 
you try them all and what's best for you
one<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> more<00:01:53.100> common<00:01:53.549> positions<00:01:54.090> these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
one of the more common positions these

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
one of the more common positions these
days<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> vertical<00:01:55.799> forward<00:01:56.610> grip

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
days is to use a vertical forward grip

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.590 
days is to use a vertical forward grip
and<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.799> location<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> grip<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> even

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and the location of the grip is even

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.560 
and the location of the grip is even
controversial<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.520> again<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
controversial when you know again it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
controversial when you know again it's
probably<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> depend<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:05.040> long

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
probably going to depend on how long

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.359 
probably going to depend on how long
your<00:02:05.610> arm<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.119> how<00:02:06.659> strong<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.469> arm<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.979> all

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
your arm is how strong your arm is all

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
your arm is how strong your arm is all
kinds<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> other<00:02:09.330> things<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.800> most

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
kinds of other things but for the most

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.790 
kinds of other things but for the most
part<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.270> using<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.750> vertical<00:02:12.989> grip

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
part when you're using a vertical grip

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
part when you're using a vertical grip
you<00:02:14.370> want<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:14.880> basically<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> same<00:02:15.720> type

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you want to use basically the same type

handgun but you want to shove it kind of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.390 
handgun but you want to shove it kind of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
thumb is forward just like it would be

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
thumb is forward just like it would be
on<00:02:30.540> my<00:02:30.750> pistol<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.770> I'm<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:32.040> bring<00:02:32.220> it

on<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.050> magazine<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.610> many<00:02:59.790> years

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
on the magazine well and for many years

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.810 
on the magazine well and for many years
with<00:03:00.510> an<00:03:00.630> mp5<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.530> was<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.860> Swat<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.490> used

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
with an mp5 when I was in Swat I used

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.940 
with an mp5 when I was in Swat I used
that<00:03:03.030> position<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.260> found<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.830> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that position and I found that that it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.040 
that position and I found that that it
worked<00:03:05.100> pretty<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.700> because<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.630> kept<00:03:06.930> my

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
worked pretty good because it kept my

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.410 
worked pretty good because it kept my
arms<00:03:07.350> in<00:03:07.560> nice<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.040> tight<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.000> could<00:03:09.210> use

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
arms in nice and tight and I could use

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.800 
arms in nice and tight and I could use
them<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.950> downside<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.940> position<00:03:12.660> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
them the downside of that position is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.500 
them the downside of that position is
that<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> whole<00:03:14.160> lot<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.700> weight<00:03:15.090> out

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that you have a whole lot of weight out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.850 
that you have a whole lot of weight out
here<00:03:16.350> now

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
here now

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.710 
here now
certainly<00:03:17.490> more<00:03:17.790> weight<00:03:18.030> than<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.360> had<00:03:18.570> with

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
certainly more weight than I had with

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.860 
certainly more weight than I had with
the<00:03:18.870> mp5<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.160> by<00:03:20.370> putting<00:03:20.790> your<00:03:20.940> hand<00:03:21.239> forward

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
the mp5 so by putting your hand forward

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
the mp5 so by putting your hand forward
it<00:03:22.110> allows<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.070> control<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.760> weight

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
it allows you to control that weight

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.940 
it allows you to control that weight
better<00:03:24.270> when<00:03:24.540> transitioning<00:03:25.260> from<00:03:25.350> target<00:03:25.830> to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
better when transitioning from target to

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.729 
better when transitioning from target to
target<00:03:26.480> many<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> competition<00:03:28.500> people

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
target many of the competition people

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.310 
target many of the competition people
will<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.030> reach<00:03:30.330> out<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.690> grab

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
will have you just reach out and grab

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.770 
will have you just reach out and grab
the<00:03:31.590> top<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> fore<00:03:32.280> end<00:03:32.520> like<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.720> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the top of the fore end like this so you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.180 
the top of the fore end like this so you
can<00:03:34.080> steer<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> pretty<00:03:34.950> good

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
can steer it it's a pretty good

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.240 
can steer it it's a pretty good
technique<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.390> works<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.050> again<00:03:37.800> use

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
technique if it works for you again use

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.330 
technique if it works for you again use
what<00:03:38.459> works<00:03:38.610> best<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.060> you
