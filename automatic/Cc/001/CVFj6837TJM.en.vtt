going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> say<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:59.399> if<00:02:01.430> if<00:02:02.430> Matthias<00:02:03.119> is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
going to say that if if if Matthias is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to say that if if if Matthias is
not<00:02:03.479> maxed<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:03.930> he's<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.320> close<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.710> max

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
not maxed out he's pretty close to max

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
not maxed out he's pretty close to max
out<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> opposite<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.600> basically

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
out on the opposite and we see basically

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.949 
out on the opposite and we see basically
the<00:02:07.229> bulk<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.039> bulk<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.550> cutes<00:02:09.239> troops<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the bulk the bulk of cutes troops and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.720 
the bulk the bulk of cutes troops and
the<00:02:10.259> inside<00:02:10.619> nine<00:02:10.800> o'clock<00:02:11.039> expansion<00:02:11.580> he's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the inside nine o'clock expansion he's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.190 
the inside nine o'clock expansion he's
knows<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:12.480> essentially<00:02:12.930> where<00:02:13.020> all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
knows that that's essentially where all

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.910 
knows that that's essentially where all
his<00:02:13.349> production<00:02:13.770> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
his production is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.199 
his production is
I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.370> he's<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.610> hoping<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.120> can

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I think he's just hoping that he can

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.309 
I think he's just hoping that he can
hold<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.569> but<00:02:15.720> honestly<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.080> don't<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.260> how

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
hold out but honestly I don't know how

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.380 
hold out but honestly I don't know how
we<00:02:16.470> could<00:02:16.530> even<00:02:16.770> reinforce<00:02:17.250> across<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.180> map

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
we could even reinforce across this map

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.820 
we could even reinforce across this map
which<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.720> essentially<00:02:19.230> halfway<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.650> now

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is essentially halfway on now

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
which is essentially halfway on now
we're<00:02:19.950> seeing<00:02:20.130> an<00:02:20.220> observer<00:02:20.520> go<00:02:20.700> across<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
we're seeing an observer go across the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.490 
we're seeing an observer go across the
bottom<00:02:21.569> right<00:02:21.750> hand<00:02:21.780> corner<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.110> starting<00:02:22.470> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
bottom right hand corner and starting to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.290 
bottom right hand corner and starting to
come<00:02:22.680> across<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.160> six<00:02:23.430> o'clock<00:02:23.580> location<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
come across the six o'clock location and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
come across the six o'clock location and
as<00:02:24.540> soon<00:02:24.660> as<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.930> pastas<00:02:25.290> command<00:02:25.590> center

honestly<00:02:26.340> once<00:02:26.730> again<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.239> think

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
honestly once again I don't think

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.449 
honestly once again I don't think
there's<00:02:27.569> anything<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.230> done<00:02:28.459> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
there's anything that can be done and

there's anything that can be done and
who<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.270> don't<00:02:30.390> even<00:02:30.569> see<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> single<00:02:30.959> science

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
who I don't even see a single science

who I don't even see a single science
vessel<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.680> air<00:02:31.770> looks<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> lot<00:02:32.250> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
vessel in the air looks like a lot of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.770 
vessel in the air looks like a lot of
vultures<00:02:32.610> gathering<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.060> starting<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.630> put

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.020 
mines at the inside twelve o'clock
location<00:02:35.250> looks<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:35.640> might<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.880> going

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
location looks like they might be going

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.610 
location looks like they might be going
for<00:02:36.180> an<00:02:36.239> attack<00:02:36.450> rate<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.110> twelve<00:02:37.410> o'clock

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
for an attack rate at the twelve o'clock

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
for an attack rate at the twelve o'clock
location<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.459> see<00:02:38.580> oh<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
location but as you can see oh and this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.430 
location but as you can see oh and this
is<00:02:39.180> unfortunate<00:02:39.720> because<00:02:39.959> looks<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
is unfortunate because looks like a

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
is unfortunate because looks like a
pylons<00:02:40.860> being<00:02:41.069> taken<00:02:41.340> down<00:02:41.370> right<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:41.850> to

field I don't see yeah actually those

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.599 
field I don't see yeah actually those

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
mines that doesn't look like the

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.680 
mines that doesn't look like the
reserves<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> field<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.600> the

mines but fortunately for Matthias the
mines<00:03:35.970> are<00:03:36.090> only<00:03:36.269> catching<00:03:36.690> single<00:03:36.959> units<00:03:37.230> at

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
mines are only catching single units at

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.690 
mines are only catching single units at
a<00:03:37.380> time<00:03:37.620> as<00:03:37.829> they're<00:03:38.010> kind<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.549> across

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
a time as they're kind of going across

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120 
a time as they're kind of going across
the<00:03:38.940> map<00:03:39.320> he<00:03:40.320> does<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.590> an<00:03:40.709> established

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the map he does have an established

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.710 
the map he does have an established
position<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.060> inside<00:03:42.359> nine<00:03:42.510> o'clock

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
position at the inside nine o'clock

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.940 
position at the inside nine o'clock
position<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.230> looks<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> main<00:03:43.769> is

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
position it looks like the main is

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.289 
position it looks like the main is
essentially<00:03:44.430> mind<00:03:44.609> out<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> secondaries

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
essentially mind out the secondaries

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.180 
essentially mind out the secondaries
also<00:03:45.600> mined<00:03:45.780> out<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.350> i<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.100> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
also mined out so i think it's just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.410 
also mined out so i think it's just
going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.549> matter<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.850> time<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.239> looks

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
going to be a matter of time here looks

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
going to be a matter of time here looks

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
o'clock location with those arbiters if

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.780 
o'clock location with those arbiters if
there<00:05:28.560> isn't<00:05:28.800> anything<00:05:29.010> if<00:05:29.580> they're

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
there isn't anything if they're

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.370 
there isn't anything if they're
basically<00:05:30.270> isn't<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:30.690> kind<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.990> cliffside

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
basically isn't just kind of a cliffside

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.280 
basically isn't just kind of a cliffside
push<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:32.790> yeah<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> lot<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.450> over<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:33.960> actually

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
push and yeah a lot of over is actually

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.180 
push and yeah a lot of over is actually
out<00:05:34.410> in<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.530> air<00:05:34.620> doesn't<00:05:34.770> look<00:05:34.919> like<00:05:35.040> any

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
out in the air doesn't look like any

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.650 
out in the air doesn't look like any
more<00:05:35.370> arbiters<00:05:35.640> being<00:05:35.820> produced<00:05:36.000> now<00:05:36.390> some

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
more arbiters being produced now some

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.060 
more arbiters being produced now some
carriers<00:05:37.050> actually<00:05:37.440> out<00:05:37.560> in<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.740> air<00:05:37.860> so

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
carriers actually out in the air so

carriers actually out in the air so
Mathias<00:05:38.970> done<00:05:39.180> messing<00:05:39.510> around<00:05:39.630> he's

Mathias done messing around he's

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.210 
Mathias done messing around he's
switched<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.350> carriers<00:05:40.680> he<00:05:40.770> feels<00:05:40.979> like<00:05:41.070> he's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
switched to carriers he feels like he's

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.920 
switched to carriers he feels like he's
in<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.400> strong<00:05:41.580> economical<00:05:42.120> position<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.600> do<00:05:42.720> so

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
in a strong economical position to do so

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.680 
in a strong economical position to do so
and<00:05:43.740> yeah<00:05:44.010> now<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.280> arbiter<00:05:44.760> starting<00:05:45.600> to

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
and yeah now that arbiter starting to

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.450 
and yeah now that arbiter starting to
push<00:05:45.870> inside<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.890> it<00:05:46.979> looks<00:05:47.160> like<00:05:47.190> he's<00:05:47.370> going

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
push inside and it looks like he's going

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.280 
push inside and it looks like he's going
to<00:05:47.550> create<00:05:47.790> a<00:05:47.880> kind<00:05:48.270> of<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.450> reinforcement<00:05:48.990> wall

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
to create a kind of a reinforcement wall

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.680 
to create a kind of a reinforcement wall
with<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.919> arbiters<00:05:50.310> here<00:05:50.610> kind<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.419> at<00:05:51.600> the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
with the arbiters here kind of at the

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.450 
with the arbiters here kind of at the
cliffside<00:05:52.050> junction<00:05:52.530> between<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:53.250> six

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
cliffside junction between the six

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.610 
cliffside junction between the six
o'clock<00:05:53.640> location<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.200> middle<00:05:55.440> of<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
o'clock location and the middle of the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.560 
o'clock location and the middle of the
map<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.800> nice<00:05:56.160> stasis<00:05:56.640> all<00:05:56.760> over<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.120> tanks<00:05:57.450> and

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
map a nice stasis all over the tanks and

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.719 
map a nice stasis all over the tanks and
a<00:05:58.080> kind<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.710> pincer<00:05:59.100> attack<00:05:59.130> from<00:05:59.550> both

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
a kind of a pincer attack from both

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.000 
a kind of a pincer attack from both
directions<00:06:00.050> stasis<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.229> a<00:06:01.320> good<00:06:01.530> group<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.860> the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
directions stasis in a good group of the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.620 
directions stasis in a good group of the
tanks<00:06:02.280> about<00:06:02.460> four<00:06:02.669> tanks<00:06:02.940> to<00:06:03.060> Goliath<00:06:03.360> and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
tanks about four tanks to Goliath and

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.750 
tanks about four tanks to Goliath and
now<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.290> inside<00:06:04.650> eight<00:06:04.800> o'clock<00:06:05.070> location

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
now that inside eight o'clock location

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.360 
now that inside eight o'clock location
once<00:06:06.060> again<00:06:06.330> at<00:06:06.570> risk<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.080> it<00:06:08.070> looks<00:06:08.220> like<00:06:08.280> a

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
once again at risk and it looks like a

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.190 
once again at risk and it looks like a
full<00:06:08.820> upgrades<00:06:09.240> though<00:06:09.450> on<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.690> opposite<00:06:10.050> end

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
full upgrades though on the opposite end

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.159 
full upgrades though on the opposite end
for<00:06:10.860> cute<00:06:11.220> so<00:06:11.490> cute<00:06:11.669> maybe<00:06:12.630> he'll<00:06:12.870> be<00:06:12.990> able<00:06:13.050> to

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
for cute so cute maybe he'll be able to

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.630 
for cute so cute maybe he'll be able to
do<00:06:13.320> something<00:06:13.680> but<00:06:13.830> I'll<00:06:13.979> say<00:06:14.190> just<00:06:14.400> still<00:06:14.610> I

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
do something but I'll say just still I

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.920 
do something but I'll say just still I
don't<00:06:14.880> think<00:06:15.240> he<00:06:15.300> has<00:06:15.390> enough<00:06:15.419> troops<00:06:15.720> on<00:06:15.900> the

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
don't think he has enough troops on the

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.710 
don't think he has enough troops on the
ground<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.470> really<00:06:16.650> do<00:06:16.740> it<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.919> nice<00:06:17.250> stasis<00:06:17.940> at

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
ground to really do it a nice stasis at

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.120 
ground to really do it a nice stasis at
again<00:06:19.169> at<00:06:19.290> that<00:06:19.410> insight<00:06:19.770> nine<00:06:19.919> o'clock

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
again at that insight nine o'clock

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
location looks like we saw some distance

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.450 
location looks like we saw some distance
mining<00:06:21.990> that's<00:06:22.350> how<00:06:22.530> desperate<00:06:22.800> cute<00:06:23.280> is<00:06:23.430> for

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
mining that's how desperate cute is for

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.190 
mining that's how desperate cute is for
resources<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.419> he's<00:06:24.479> going<00:06:24.630> to<00:06:24.690> GG<00:06:25.020> right

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
resources and he's going to GG right

resources and he's going to GG right
there<00:06:25.440> just<00:06:25.950> knowing<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.310> he<00:06:26.370> can't<00:06:26.610> hold

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
there just knowing that he can't hold

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
onslaught of troops does not have the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.240 
onslaught of troops does not have the
economy<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:30.660> really<00:06:30.930> take<00:06:31.169> Mathias<00:06:31.800> town<00:06:32.040> so
