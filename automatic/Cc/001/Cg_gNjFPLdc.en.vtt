okay<00:00:00.750> pruning<00:00:01.199> hydrangeas<00:00:01.949> are<00:00:02.100> so<00:00:02.399> many

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.750 
okay pruning hydrangeas are so many

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.190 
okay pruning hydrangeas are so many
different<00:00:03.750> methods<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:05.509> pruning<00:00:06.509> hydrangeas

different methods of pruning hydrangeas

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.540 
different methods of pruning hydrangeas
and<00:00:07.379> that's<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.890> depending<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.400> where

method for cutting hydrangeas

method for cutting hydrangeas
whenever<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.070> pruning<00:00:47.399> macro<00:00:47.850> phyla

whenever you're pruning macro phyla
hydrangeas<00:00:48.840> cut<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> green<00:00:49.890> part<00:00:50.570> because

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
hydrangeas cut on the green part because

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.549 
hydrangeas cut on the green part because
most<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.170> bloom<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.160> old<00:00:53.670> wood<00:00:54.559> versus

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
most of them bloom on old wood versus

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.920 
most of them bloom on old wood versus
new<00:00:55.770> wood<00:00:56.010> there's<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> lot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> varieties

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
new wood there's a lot of varieties

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
new wood there's a lot of varieties
coming<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.219> blue<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.609> new<00:00:59.820> wood

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
coming out or out the blue on new wood

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
coming out or out the blue on new wood
but<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.020> still<00:01:01.320> treat<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> same<00:01:01.890> way

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
but I still treat them the same way

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.410 
but I still treat them the same way
because<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.589> you're<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.979> lose<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> tag

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because you you're like me lose the tag

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
because you you're like me lose the tag
to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> plan<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.380> can't<00:01:07.619> remember<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.040> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to the plan you can't remember which one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
to the plan you can't remember which one
begins<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.700> old<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.780> bond<00:01:10.020> blooms<00:01:10.290> on

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
begins on old with which bond blooms on

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
begins on old with which bond blooms on
new<00:01:10.650> wood<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.030> same

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
new wood because and they look the same

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
new wood because and they look the same
it's<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> hard<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> tell<00:01:13.439> them<00:01:13.590> apart

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it's so hard to tell them apart

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.840 
it's so hard to tell them apart
so<00:01:14.729> generally<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> fall<00:01:16.700> when<00:01:17.700> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so generally just in the fall when it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
so generally just in the fall when it's
still<00:01:18.060> actively<00:01:18.540> growing<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.229> mean<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.530> kind

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
still actively growing I mean we're kind

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
still actively growing I mean we're kind
of<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.860> glorious<00:01:20.460> fall<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.270> things<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.990> we're

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of a glorious fall here things if we're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
of a glorious fall here things if we're
going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> keep<00:01:22.439> growing<00:01:22.590> until<00:01:23.040> December<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to keep growing until December so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to keep growing until December so
could<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> prove<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.020> later<00:01:25.200> yes

and I'll do some hunting on a penny

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.090 
and I'll do some hunting on a penny
colada<00:01:56.510> later<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.560> can<00:01:57.590> put<00:01:57.920> those<00:01:58.040> on

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
colada later but you can put those on

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.190 
colada later but you can put those on
the<00:01:58.310> spring<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.600> do<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.900> on<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the spring and I like to do that on the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.930 
the spring and I like to do that on the
spring<00:02:00.530> because<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.550> blooms<00:02:01.790> are

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
spring because then the blooms are

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.300 
spring because then the blooms are
smaller<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.720> they<00:02:03.200> don't<00:02:03.350> flop<00:02:03.650> over<00:02:03.860> as<00:02:04.130> much

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
smaller and they don't flop over as much

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.680 
smaller and they don't flop over as much
if<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:05.000> trouble<00:02:05.240> with<00:02:05.510> your

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
if you have that trouble with your

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.120 
if you have that trouble with your
initial<00:02:06.560> Odyssey<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.950> white

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
initial Odyssey so that the white

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.450 
initial Odyssey so that the white
conical<00:02:10.700> shape<00:02:10.910> flows<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.770> tree<00:02:13.010> forms<00:02:13.340> that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
conical shape flows the tree forms that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.270 
conical shape flows the tree forms that
we<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.880> Colliers<00:02:14.560> okay<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:15.800> what<00:02:16.190> I'm

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
we have in Colliers okay so what I'm

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.560 
we have in Colliers okay so what I'm
going<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.430> do<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.880> start<00:02:17.030> doing<00:02:17.330> some

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
going to do is just start doing some

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.740 
going to do is just start doing some
pruning<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.470> keep<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:19.630> possibly<00:02:20.630> two

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
pruning I like to keep one possibly two

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.650 
pruning I like to keep one possibly two
leaf<00:02:21.350> nodes<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.580> stem<00:02:22.880> when<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:23.240> finished

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
leaf nodes on the stem when I'm finished

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.230 
leaf nodes on the stem when I'm finished
pruning<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.920> leaf<00:02:25.130> node<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.060> get

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
pruning and the leaf node I like to get

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.570 
pruning and the leaf node I like to get
a<00:02:26.270> nice<00:02:26.450> healthy<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:27.200> counting<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.950> wrong<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
a nice healthy one counting is wrong and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.090 
a nice healthy one counting is wrong and
that<00:02:28.640> means<00:02:29.270> it's<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:29.690> nodes<00:02:29.990> or<00:02:30.350> leaf<00:02:30.800> on

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that means it's got nodes or leaf on

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.760 
that means it's got nodes or leaf on
each<00:02:31.610> side<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> stem<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:33.530> some

feel<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.440> have<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.860> prove<00:02:58.070> if<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.270> want

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
feel like you have to prove if you want

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.810 
feel like you have to prove if you want
to<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.170> take<00:03:00.320> off<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.709> old<00:03:00.739> dead<00:03:01.220> heads<00:03:01.489> and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
to just take off the old dead heads and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.690 
to just take off the old dead heads and
do<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> little<00:03:02.209> shaping<00:03:02.739> that's<00:03:03.739> all<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.550> need

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
do a little shaping that's all you need

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.810 
do a little shaping that's all you need
to<00:03:04.850> do<00:03:05.260> when<00:03:06.260> I'm<00:03:06.380> done<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.680> usually<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:07.670> not

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
to do when I'm done I usually I'm not

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.070 
to do when I'm done I usually I'm not
going<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.000> do<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> whole<00:03:08.330> plant<00:03:08.660> right<00:03:08.870> now

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
going to do the whole plant right now

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.620 
going to do the whole plant right now
because<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.520> few<00:03:10.730> more<00:03:10.850> demonstrations

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
because I have a few more demonstrations

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.130 
because I have a few more demonstrations
to<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:11.930> later<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.459> mature<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.660> plants

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
to do later and mature the plants

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.820 
to do later and mature the plants
tomorrow<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.100> next

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
tomorrow and next

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.260 
tomorrow and next
and<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.460> I'm<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.880> do<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> few

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
and so I'm just going to do a few

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.880 
and so I'm just going to do a few
branches<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.870> I'll<00:03:19.020> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.350> show<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.620> up

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
branches and I'll kind of show you up

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.000 
branches and I'll kind of show you up
close<00:03:20.180> where<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.210> prove<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:22.020> feel<00:03:22.740> free<00:03:22.980> to

come in if you want to I'm I'm going to
just<00:03:25.560> reach<00:03:25.740> in<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.160> grab<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.430> few<00:03:26.820> and

just reach in here and grab a few and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.920 
just reach in here and grab a few and
then<00:03:27.980> David<00:03:28.980> if<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.310> come<00:03:29.520> in<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.790> zoom<00:03:30.780> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
then David if you can come in and zoom a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
then David if you can come in and zoom a
little<00:03:30.960> bit<00:03:33.140> just<00:03:34.140> pull<00:03:34.440> down<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:37.830> you

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
can kind of see where I've pruned in the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.180 
can kind of see where I've pruned in the
years<00:03:40.020> past<00:03:44.960> somebody<00:03:45.960> can<00:03:46.110> hold<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.680> branch

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
years past somebody can hold a branch

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.400 
years past somebody can hold a branch
here<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.210> could<00:03:48.510> thank<00:03:48.690> you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
kind of see where I pruned in the years

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.840 
kind of see where I pruned in the years
prior<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:55.500> here's<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.830> place<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.310> pruned<00:03:56.580> last

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
prior like here's a place I pruned last

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.060 
prior like here's a place I pruned last
year<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.450> then<00:03:58.140> deeper<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.680> there's<00:03:58.920> another

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
year and then deeper in there's another

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.130 
year and then deeper in there's another
place<00:03:59.520> where<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> prune<00:04:00.150> last<00:04:00.480> year<00:04:00.810> or<00:04:01.020> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
place where I prune last year or the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.940 
place where I prune last year or the
year<00:04:01.170> before<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.980> what<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.090> here's<00:04:03.420> a

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
year before so what I do is here's a

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.470 
year before so what I do is here's a
here's<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.040> leaf<00:04:05.280> node<00:04:05.310> here<00:04:05.820> that's<00:04:06.030> nice<00:04:06.209> and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
here's a leaf node here that's nice and

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.990 
here's a leaf node here that's nice and
even<00:04:06.840> here's<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> leaf<00:04:07.920> node<00:04:07.950> that's<00:04:08.520> nice<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
even here's a leaf node that's nice and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.600 
even here's a leaf node that's nice and
even<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:10.110> I<00:04:10.140> would<00:04:10.500> probably<00:04:10.740> just<00:04:11.010> cut<00:04:11.400> on

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
even so I would probably just cut on

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.060 
even so I would probably just cut on
that<00:04:11.820> one<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.150> there<00:04:12.420> cut<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.290> about<00:04:13.410> half

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
that one right there cut it about half

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.870 
that one right there cut it about half
an<00:04:14.220> inch<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.640> an<00:04:14.730> inch<00:04:14.990> at<00:04:15.990> an<00:04:16.200> angle<00:04:18.049> and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
an inch to an inch at an angle and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.159 
an inch to an inch at an angle and
things<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:21.150> yeah<00:04:21.480> those<00:04:21.660> are<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.049> the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
things in yeah those are going to be the

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.250 
things in yeah those are going to be the
stems<00:04:22.650> next<00:04:23.070> year<00:04:23.630> that's<00:04:24.630> what<00:04:24.900> I'm<00:04:25.020> calling

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
stems next year that's what I'm calling

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.750 
stems next year that's what I'm calling
a<00:04:25.500> leaf<00:04:25.710> node<00:04:26.120> see<00:04:27.120> here's<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.390> leaf<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.760> before

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
a leaf node see here's a leaf and before

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.730 
a leaf node see here's a leaf and before
they're<00:04:29.940> leaves<00:04:30.180> or<00:04:30.480> before<00:04:30.810> their<00:04:31.050> branches

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
they're leaves or before their branches

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.440 
they're leaves or before their branches
there's<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.700> little<00:04:32.910> thing<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.240> want<00:04:36.390> me

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
there's this little thing if you want me

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:46.690 
there's this little thing if you want me
to<00:04:36.540> do<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> few<00:04:36.990> more<00:04:38.810> David<00:04:39.810> did<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.930> get<00:04:40.140> that

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.100 

and<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.910> wouldn't<00:04:48.150> be<00:04:48.270> considered<00:04:48.390> severe

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and that wouldn't be considered severe

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.350 
and that wouldn't be considered severe
pruning<00:04:49.380> no<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.610> just<00:04:50.760> annual

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
pruning no this is just annual

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.090 
pruning no this is just annual
maintenance<00:04:51.600> pruning<00:04:52.080> because<00:04:52.800> if<00:04:52.950> you'll

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
maintenance pruning because if you'll

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.400 
maintenance pruning because if you'll
see<00:04:53.340> I'm<00:04:53.640> not<00:04:54.030> cutting<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.480> down<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> lot<00:04:54.990> every

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
see I'm not cutting it down a lot every

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.550 
see I'm not cutting it down a lot every
year<00:04:57.169> because<00:04:58.169> it's<00:04:58.440> going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> grow<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.890> few

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
year because it's going to grow a few

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.740 
year because it's going to grow a few
feet<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:02.250> one<00:05:02.460> particularly

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
feet this one particularly

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.130 
feet this one particularly
not<00:05:04.590> all<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.800> them<00:05:05.010> grow<00:05:05.220> two<00:05:05.520> feet<00:05:05.900> or<00:05:06.900> three

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
not all of them grow two feet or three

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.200 
not all of them grow two feet or three
feet<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.410> year

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
feet a year

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.180 
feet a year
this<00:05:09.210> one<00:05:09.450> does<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:10.230> can<00:05:10.410> see<00:05:10.620> where<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:10.830> prayed

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
this one does you can see where I prayed

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.120 
this one does you can see where I prayed
you<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.520> see<00:05:11.760> all<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.960> growth<00:05:13.380> is<00:05:13.710> from<00:05:13.950> this

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
you can see all this growth is from this

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.700 
you can see all this growth is from this
year<00:05:14.370> but
