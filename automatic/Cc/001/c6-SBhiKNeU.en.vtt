00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
because it's done by be trained I think

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.210

the<00:03:49.580> art<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.120> animation<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:51.019> really<00:03:51.980> good

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.509 
the art and animation is really good
however<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:53.299> notice<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.890> they<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:55.190> cut

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.210 
however you will notice that they do cut
corners<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.360> any<00:03:56.480> other<00:03:56.630> anime

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
corners just like in any other anime

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.940 
corners just like in any other anime
anything<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:59.080> doesn't<00:04:00.080> really<00:04:00.500> have<00:04:00.920> to

anything that doesn't really have to
move<00:04:01.430> won't<00:04:01.820> move<00:04:02.320> but<00:04:03.320> even<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.950> still

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
I said the story and pacing for this

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.420 
I said the story and pacing for this
anime<00:05:23.070> isn't<00:05:23.430> very<00:05:23.610> good<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.990> first<00:05:25.770> couple

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
anime isn't very good the first couple

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.700 
anime isn't very good the first couple
episodes<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:27.090> actually<00:05:27.510> really<00:05:27.720> not<00:05:28.560> that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
episodes are actually really not that

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.810 
episodes are actually really not that
great<00:05:28.920> but<00:05:30.200> as<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.230> series<00:05:31.620> goes<00:05:31.800> on<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.550> really

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
great but as a series goes on it really

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.400 
great but as a series goes on it really
gets<00:05:33.000> better<00:05:33.860> until<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.550> last<00:05:35.820> third<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.750> the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
gets better until the last third of the

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.490 
gets better until the last third of the
series<00:05:37.800> really<00:05:38.040> hits<00:05:38.370> its<00:05:38.550> shining<00:05:38.850> point
