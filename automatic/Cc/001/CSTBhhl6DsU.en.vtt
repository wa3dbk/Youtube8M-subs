terra firma graft in this episode we are

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.570 
terra firma graft in this episode we are
going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.320> take<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.160> bloomerang

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to take a look at the bloomerang

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.830 
going to take a look at the bloomerang
i'm<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> show<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.210> guys<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.570> use

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
i'm going to show you guys how to use

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.450 
i'm going to show you guys how to use
the<00:00:13.049> blue<00:00:13.200> memory<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> build<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the blue memory and how to build one a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
the blue memory and how to build one a
blue<00:00:15.299> murray<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.690> essentially<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.710> place<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
blue murray is essentially a place to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720 
blue murray is essentially a place to
smelt<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.330> bulk<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.189> lot<00:00:20.550> more

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
smelt for in bulk so it is a lot more

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
smelt for in bulk so it is a lot more
efficient<00:00:21.210> than<00:00:21.390> trying<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.779> use<00:00:22.020> fire<00:00:22.470> places

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
efficient than trying to use fire places

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.750 
efficient than trying to use fire places
like<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> anyway<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> order<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.099> make<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
like that so anyway in order to make a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
like that so anyway in order to make a
bloom<00:00:27.060> reap<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> need<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
bloom reap what we're going to need is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.569 
bloom reap what we're going to need is
some<00:00:28.470> charcoal<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.300> chisel<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.449> some<00:00:30.720> kind<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
some charcoal a chisel of some kind and

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
some charcoal a chisel of some kind and
some<00:00:32.579> rock<00:00:33.440> we're<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> need<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> turn

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
some rock we're going to need to turn

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.690 
some rock we're going to need to turn
some<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> rock<00:00:35.989> in<00:00:37.219> two<00:00:38.219> bricks<00:00:38.460> just

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
some of that rock in two bricks just

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.830 
some of that rock in two bricks just
like<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.420> easy<00:00:42.420> peasy<00:00:44.690> then<00:00:45.690> we're

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
like that and so easy peasy then we're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
like that and so easy peasy then we're
going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> need<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> crafting<00:00:46.559> bench<00:00:47.300> take

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
going to need a crafting bench take

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
going to need a crafting bench take
these<00:00:48.510> bricks<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:50.210> believe<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
these bricks and then I believe it is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
these bricks and then I believe it is
just<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> big<00:00:52.379> thing<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
just a big thing like that with a bit of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540 
just a big thing like that with a bit of
charcoal<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> middle<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.219> charcoal

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
charcoal in the middle just one charcoal

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.700 
charcoal in the middle just one charcoal
really<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> there<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.530> blue

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
really and there you go you have a blue

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.270 
really and there you go you have a blue
Marie<00:00:59.149> it's<00:01:00.149> essentially<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
Marie it's essentially all you need for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.469 
Marie it's essentially all you need for
the<00:01:03.799> for<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.830> mechanics<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> do

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the for the mechanics of it but you do

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
the for the mechanics of it but you do
need<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> build<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> structure<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
need to build a structure for it so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.960 
need to build a structure for it so
that's<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
there we go so we're building here is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
there we go so we're building here is
the<00:01:19.310> kind<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> external<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:22.790> yeah<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the kind of the external kind of yeah so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.050 
the kind of the external kind of yeah so
this<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.509> anything<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.729> regular

stone or you can use stone brick like
I'm<00:01:29.490> doing<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:32.780> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
regular cop shirt like that although if

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
regular cop shirt like that although if
you<00:01:37.350> use<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> church<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.579> regular<00:01:38.700> stone

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you use the church or just regular stone

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
you use the church or just regular stone
you<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.409> careful<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> bottom

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you do have to be careful on the bottom

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.120 
you do have to be careful on the bottom
layer<00:01:41.930> because<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.049> need<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> leave<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.799> hole

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
layer because you need to leave a hole

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.690 
layer because you need to leave a hole
at<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.460> bottom<00:01:44.670> open<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.520> all

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
at the bottom open when you have all

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.030 
at the bottom open when you have all
that<00:01:47.790> done<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> place<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.350> blue

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that done you're going to place the blue

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
that done you're going to place the blue
Marie<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.000> hole<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> moves<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
Marie in the hole when it moves to the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.969 
Marie in the hole when it moves to the
double<00:01:53.399> line<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.840> sideways<00:01:55.470> equal

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
double line the little sideways equal

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.289 
double line the little sideways equal
sign<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:56.969> was<00:01:57.060> place

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
sign then you know it was place

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
sign then you know it was place
correctly<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.439> look<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.680> interface<00:01:59.040> here

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
correctly so look at the interface here

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
correctly so look at the interface here
on<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.090> far<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> where<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> put

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
on the far right this is where you put

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.800 
on the far right this is where you put
the<00:02:03.350> what's<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.439> called<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.710> molt<00:02:05.009> or

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the what's it called the molt or

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
the what's it called the molt or
represents<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:08.129> been<00:02:08.160> dropped

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
represents how much or has been dropped

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.839 
represents how much or has been dropped
into<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> blue<00:02:10.110> Marie<00:02:10.319> charcoal<00:02:11.099> etc<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
stairway to the top is going to be

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.920 
stairway to the top is going to be
instrumental<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.160> well<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.870> to

place material into the blue Murray it's
also<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.570> helpful<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.320> something<00:02:46.830> set

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
also a bit helpful to have something set

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.780 
also a bit helpful to have something set
up<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.280> prevent<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:48.050> walking<00:02:49.790> yourself

up to prevent you from walking yourself
into<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.130> something<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.390> will

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
into it so something like this this will

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.480 
into it so something like this this will
allow<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.230> walk<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.770> up<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.190> without

bit extra ok let's throw this in DotA

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.809 
bit extra ok let's throw this in DotA
and<00:03:21.780> there<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.590> go

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.550 

alright<00:03:26.819> cool<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.840> saw<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.110> filled<00:03:28.410> up

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
alright cool and see saw that filled up

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
alright cool and see saw that filled up
that<00:03:28.800> means<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.069> completely<00:03:29.430> full<00:03:29.580> let's<00:03:30.569> go

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
that means it's completely full let's go

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.080 
that means it's completely full let's go
back<00:03:30.900> down<00:03:30.930> here<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.349> see<00:03:31.560> how<00:03:31.680> we're<00:03:31.860> doing

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
back down here and see how we're doing

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.850 
back down here and see how we're doing
so<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.209> says<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.480> half<00:03:33.660> full<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:34.020> at<00:03:34.230> half<00:03:34.650> full

charcoal perfect if it was full or all

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020 
charcoal perfect if it was full or all
the<00:03:37.349> way<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.739> would<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.130> hot<00:03:38.340> enough<00:03:38.640> on

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the way it would get hot enough on

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
the way it would get hot enough on
lefthand<00:03:39.300> hide<00:03:39.599> here<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.290> actually<00:03:40.709> melt<00:03:40.920> the
