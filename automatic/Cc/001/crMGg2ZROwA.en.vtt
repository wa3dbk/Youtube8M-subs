in<00:01:02.940> order<00:01:03.179> to<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.449> better<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in order to do that better you want to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
in order to do that better you want to
go<00:01:04.259> against<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> wall<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:06.020> pretend<00:01:07.020> there's

your feet as low as you can against the
wall<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.500> pretty<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:11.009> bend<00:01:11.490> your

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 
wall and I will pretty much bend your
back<00:01:11.759> pretty<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.390> obviously<00:01:13.350> doing<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
back pretty well and obviously doing a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
back pretty well and obviously doing a
backbend<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.490> help<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.759> lot<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.000> oso<00:01:15.299> second

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
backbend would help a lot of oso second

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.240 
backbend would help a lot of oso second
step<00:01:16.549> jumping<00:01:17.549> into<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.950> as<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.130> get

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
step jumping into it would be as you get

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.560 
step jumping into it would be as you get
better<00:01:20.399> at<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> feel<00:01:21.149> good<00:01:21.479> from

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
better at it and you feel good from

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.380 
better at it and you feel good from
higher<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.020> start<00:01:22.229> off<00:01:22.320> doing<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.649> low<00:01:22.770> like

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
higher but start off doing it low like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
higher but start off doing it low like
what<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:27.080> as<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.350> better<00:01:28.470> you'll<00:01:28.740> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
what this as you get better you'll just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.690 
what this as you get better you'll just
like<00:01:30.799> drop<00:01:31.799> higher<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.460> jump

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
like drop higher and then you will jump

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
like drop higher and then you will jump
and<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.630> hand<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.960> later<00:01:34.170> which<00:01:34.409> is
