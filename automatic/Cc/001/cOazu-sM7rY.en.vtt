00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello with you 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.429
 sulfur case now we do a simple thing 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 we'll see how the difference works 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:21.119
 between normal disk and ssd for example here 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 you can see that here it costs 250 6s c disk 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 ssd disk 1 disk is a normal terabyte 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 seagate barracuda we will check these both 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.489
 drives on speed so let's say here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:47.550
 first choose samsung is it with us 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 ssd drive and watch it smart here we are 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.600
 we see that he is completely in order everything in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.800
 okay surface test well let's say 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 reading speed add test and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 check this test and here it comes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.490
 mom see see ssd drive he has everything 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 all sectors that you see less 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.479
 five milliseconds 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 here they run run and we see that here 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 one 10 milliseconds jumped it rather 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 All this is due to the fact that it is now 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 we test drive not vidos mode under 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 ohm windows and naturally there are some 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.240
 the disk is distracted by something else 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 so there is inhibition 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 that is, if we look at the graphic 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 speed we see what reading speed 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.640
 reading, we are checking soon reading 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.220
 240 here you see megabytes and megabytes in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.079
 second well, about staying at 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.570
 240 megabytes per second here we are 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.570
 pause for now let him check 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.049
 Well, 29 percent of the disk test passed, I 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.729
 included sound recording see jerked 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:08.179
 then this is the program here 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.979
 twitching it is with us due to the fact that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.800
 included discounts drive now he writes 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.250
 manages to describe and reproduce 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 so we see that 240 megabytes somewhere 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.739
 here she is jumping 232 240 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.640
 Well, about the speed of the disk and 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 same ssd drive and if so 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.380
 look at the components of this 5 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.709
 milliseconds you see here practically 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.670
 99 percent and only a few 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.220
 values are several dozen less than 10 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.600
 milliseconds and 1 20 milliseconds now we 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.120
 try to check the same disk 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.150
 so that when you're ordinary magnetic 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.250
 seagate barracuda in the same way 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.250
 select the seagate disk 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.420
 it's reading the disk drive to add here at 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.630
 we are here now and we are watching 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.739
 what will appear here means map is running 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.750
 you see already five milliseconds here 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.420
 There are already 20 milliseconds 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.489
 even 50 milliseconds 7 pieces and even if 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.459
 we turn on see how it all happens we 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:29.390
 see that things are on this disk 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:32.890
 much worse here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.480
 and the rate is now well forward to make a pause 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.959
 then you come back to our sheep 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.180
 and see what happened four percent 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.030
 it means the test works 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.720
 well, it is already clear that the speed of the disk 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.920
 when reading just barely passes for 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.030
 100 20 megabytes 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.350
 although there were 220 if you remember and if 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.120
 look at the speed distribution 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.570
 sectors then of course the picture is different 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.470
 that even here I have green sectors 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.209
 periodically go on ssd-disks but 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.060
 even imagine if we make this 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.310
 Test 7 ie the system nor 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.890
 that was not distracted anyway soon 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.630
 reading twice as we see is different 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.150
 well this is the same when recording 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.200
 therefore, ssd is much faster 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.540
 use it more enjoyable in life 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.850
 I have certainly allowed Well 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.700
 do a comparative analysis here 240 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:39.050
 see and here 120 is the map and it means 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.830
 here we look here, too, we compare up to 740 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.210
 Thousands of sectors checked and only one of them 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.270
 one or here then 3 and here for that is 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.070
 there is nothing more to talk about 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.050
 ssd disk 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.960
 what is called here they are mean 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.930
 speed 229 here turned out here a hundred hundred 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.910
 twice exactly two times approximately 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.060
 the actual test there is not theoretically and 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.220
 this is how it works 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.220
 you were Sergei so good evening
