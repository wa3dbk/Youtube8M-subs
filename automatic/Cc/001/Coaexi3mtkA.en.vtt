and believe it or not I found it a lot
less<00:02:31.709> painful<00:02:32.370> than<00:02:32.819> using<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.569> normal

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959

epilator with the Sun you know you
sometimes<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.150> an<00:02:36.300> epaulette<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> set<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
sometimes get an epaulette a set and it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.910 
sometimes get an epaulette a set and it
has<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> separate<00:02:38.220> head<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.910> facial<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.470> hits

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
has a separate head for facial it hits

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.580 
has a separate head for facial it hits
there's<00:02:41.370> no<00:02:41.550> denying<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.989> one<00:02:43.230> doesn't

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
there's no denying it this one doesn't

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.720 
there's no denying it this one doesn't
so<00:02:43.680> much<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> think<00:02:44.069> it's<00:02:44.340> physically

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
so much and I think it's physically

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
so much and I think it's physically
because<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.420> purely<00:02:45.810> made<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.250> face

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
because it's purely made for your face

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.820 
because it's purely made for your face
so<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.480> look<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.959> tongs<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
so if you look at the tongs and the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.759 
so if you look at the tongs and the
teeth<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:51.080> they're<00:02:52.080> plastic<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
teeth if you can see they're plastic and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.050 
teeth if you can see they're plastic and
they're<00:02:53.100> very<00:02:53.250> narrow<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> they're<00:02:53.910> very

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
they're very narrow and they're very

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.210 
they're very narrow and they're very
small<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.480> head<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:54.959> small<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.440> they're

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
small the head is very small and they're

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
small the head is very small and they're
actually<00:02:56.519> horizontal<00:02:56.790> rather<00:02:57.540> than<00:02:57.660> vertical

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
actually horizontal rather than vertical

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.110 
actually horizontal rather than vertical
so<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.440> kind<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.769> move<00:02:58.920> along<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.430> direction

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
so you kind of move along this direction

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.930 
so you kind of move along this direction
rather<00:03:00.630> than<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.920> epilator<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.610> used

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
rather than in the epilator that I used

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.550 
rather than in the epilator that I used
to<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:03.450> had<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> head<00:03:04.260> attachment

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to have which had a head attachment

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.650 
to have which had a head attachment
which<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.580> teeth<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.120> kind<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.540> had

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
which are just two teeth and kind of had

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.809 
which are just two teeth and kind of had
to<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:08.580> might<00:03:08.760> be

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
to go like that so it might be

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.430 
to go like that so it might be
psychological<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.840> sure<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.200> I've<00:03:10.290> not

essentially I'm going to it switches on
it's<00:03:28.290> straightforward<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.489> take<00:03:29.730> it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
it's straightforward and you take it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.660 
it's straightforward and you take it
across<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.359> area<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.709> starts<00:03:32.040> removing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
across the area and it starts removing

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.390 
across the area and it starts removing
the<00:03:33.450> hair<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.019> then<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.890> thing<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.160> like<00:03:35.370> about

by<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:49.829> phrase<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.700> thin<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.030> out

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
by this phrase but you can thin it out

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.390 
by this phrase but you can thin it out
and<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.769> much<00:03:52.950> better<00:03:53.100> option

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
and that I think is a much better option

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.699 
and that I think is a much better option
than<00:03:53.640> actually<00:03:54.299> taking<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.140> clean<00:03:55.380> off<00:03:55.530> and

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
than actually taking it clean off and

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.220 
than actually taking it clean off and
then<00:03:55.799> being<00:03:56.070> left<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.549> sort<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:57.230> basically

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
then being left with sort of basically

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.630 
then being left with sort of basically
tied<00:03:58.440> marks<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.920> hair

than sort of the rest of my face we're
being<00:05:29.930> very<00:05:30.050> honest<00:05:30.440> today<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:31.070> yes

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
being very honest today but that yes

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.650 
being very honest today but that yes
that's<00:05:31.520> something<00:05:31.820> I'm<00:05:31.970> sure<00:05:32.120> many<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.539> us

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
that's something I'm sure many of us

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.839 
that's something I'm sure many of us
suffer<00:05:32.900> with<00:05:33.169> so<00:05:33.530> that's<00:05:34.400> how<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.669> works

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
suffer with so that's how that works

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.420 
suffer with so that's how that works
it's<00:05:35.810> straightforward<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.680> it's<00:05:36.830> portable

it's straightforward and it's portable

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.250 
it's straightforward and it's portable
and<00:05:37.700> it's<00:05:37.820> easy<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.330> comes<00:05:38.539> in<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.750> travel<00:05:39.050> pouch

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
and it's easy it comes in a travel pouch

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.320 
and it's easy it comes in a travel pouch
so<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:39.470> really<00:05:39.919> like<00:05:40.099> it<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.849> other<00:05:40.970> thing<00:05:41.180> I'm
