basically whizzed up 250 grams of cashew
nuts<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.200> will<00:00:32.350> hole<00:00:32.560> into<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.490> powder<00:00:35.160> for

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
nuts that will hole into a powder for

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.210 
nuts that will hole into a powder for
that<00:00:36.310> I'm<00:00:36.640> going<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.090> add<00:00:37.330> one<00:00:38.220> tablespoon

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
that I'm going to add one tablespoon

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.729 
that I'm going to add one tablespoon
full<00:00:39.880> of<00:00:40.150> olive<00:00:40.810> oil<00:00:42.210> again<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:44.470> could<00:00:44.590> add

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
full of olive oil again you could add

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.160 
full of olive oil again you could add
different<00:00:45.280> kinds<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.820> cold-pressed<00:00:46.570> oils<00:00:46.750> to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
different kinds of cold-pressed oils to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.299 
different kinds of cold-pressed oils to
this<00:00:47.320> you're<00:00:47.530> not<00:00:47.620> going<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.860> cook<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.130> or

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
this you're not going to cook this or

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.310 
this you're not going to cook this or
heat<00:00:48.430> this<00:00:48.520> in<00:00:48.670> any<00:00:48.760> way<00:00:48.880> so<00:00:49.870> it's<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.080> good<00:00:50.170> idea

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
heat this in any way so it's a good idea

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.990 
heat this in any way so it's a good idea
to<00:00:50.860> use<00:00:51.190> something<00:00:51.400> that's<00:00:51.520> going<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.820> give

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
to use something that's going to give

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.780 
to use something that's going to give
you<00:00:52.120> some<00:00:52.450> essential<00:00:53.170> fat<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.739> something<00:00:54.580> like

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
you some essential fat so something like

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.090 
you some essential fat so something like
a<00:00:55.480> walnut<00:00:55.780> oil<00:00:55.930> might<00:00:56.260> work<00:00:56.440> quite<00:00:56.680> nicely<00:00:56.710> a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
a walnut oil might work quite nicely a

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.890 
a walnut oil might work quite nicely a
cold-pressed<00:00:57.370> walnut<00:00:57.850> oil<00:00:57.970> or<00:00:58.449> something

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
cold-pressed walnut oil or something

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.170 
cold-pressed walnut oil or something
like<00:00:59.080> a<00:00:59.110> pumpkin<00:00:59.500> seed<00:00:59.830> or<00:01:00.339> a<00:01:00.400> sesame<00:01:00.879> seed<00:01:00.910> oil

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
like a pumpkin seed or a sesame seed oil

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.090 
like a pumpkin seed or a sesame seed oil
and<00:01:01.390> I'm<00:01:02.350> just<00:01:02.530> going<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.710> work<00:01:02.890> with<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
and I'm just going to work with the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.420 
and I'm just going to work with the
texture<00:01:03.550> here<00:01:03.730> so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.830 

alright<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.790> we're<00:01:07.910> going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.120> continue<00:01:08.480> to

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
alright and we're going to continue to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.430 
alright and we're going to continue to
add<00:01:09.520> one<00:01:10.520> tablespoon<00:01:10.730> full<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.420> oil<00:01:11.600> at<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.170> time

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
add one tablespoon full of oil at a time

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.410 
add one tablespoon full of oil at a time
until<00:01:12.800> we<00:01:12.980> get<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.220> texture<00:01:13.610> right<00:01:13.820> it's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
until we get the texture right it's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.330 
until we get the texture right it's
personal<00:01:14.870> preference<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.010> is<00:01:16.130> going<00:01:16.280> to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
personal preference and this is going to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.510 
personal preference and this is going to
create<00:01:16.580> quite<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.940> smooth<00:01:18.100> cashew<00:01:19.100> nut<00:01:19.280> butter

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
create quite a smooth cashew nut butter

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.550 
create quite a smooth cashew nut butter
you<00:01:20.120> can<00:01:20.240> do<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:20.510> with<00:01:20.570> other<00:01:20.810> nuts<00:01:21.080> as<00:01:21.320> well

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
you can do this with other nuts as well

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.410 
you can do this with other nuts as well
but<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:22.430> thing<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.670> might<00:01:22.880> want<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.210> do<00:01:23.300> if

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
but one thing you might want to do if

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.020 
but one thing you might want to do if
you<00:01:23.600> prefer<00:01:23.990> more<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.650> crunchy<00:01:25.190> consistency

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
you prefer more of a crunchy consistency

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.120 
you prefer more of a crunchy consistency
is<00:01:26.480> keep<00:01:26.750> some<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.080> those<00:01:27.200> cashew<00:01:27.740> nuts<00:01:27.920> out

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
is keep some of those cashew nuts out

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.820 
is keep some of those cashew nuts out
and<00:01:28.520> add<00:01:29.030> them<00:01:29.120> at<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.330> very<00:01:29.570> end<00:01:29.840> might<00:01:30.230> want

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
and add them at the very end might want

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.260 
and add them at the very end might want
to<00:01:30.920> chop<00:01:31.100> them<00:01:31.340> up<00:01:31.430> into<00:01:31.580> smaller<00:01:31.760> pieces

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
to chop them up into smaller pieces

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.510 
to chop them up into smaller pieces
first<00:01:32.690> but<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.680> them<00:01:33.830> at<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:33.980> very<00:01:34.160> end<00:01:34.370> so

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
first but that them at the very end so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
first but that them at the very end so
you<00:01:34.700> get<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> more<00:01:35.030> crunchy<00:01:35.420> consistency

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.050 

that's<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.860> little<00:01:41.950> italy<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> getting<00:01:42.940> on

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
that's a little italy have a getting on

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.000 
that's a little italy have a getting on
right<00:01:43.390> we'll<00:01:43.630> see<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.930> it's<00:01:44.080> starting<00:01:44.740> to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
right we'll see that it's starting to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.649 
right we'll see that it's starting to
mix<00:01:45.159> together<00:01:45.369> but<00:01:45.820> it's<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.119> quite<00:01:46.360> as<00:01:46.510> we'd

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
mix together but it's not quite as we'd

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.630 
mix together but it's not quite as we'd
want<00:01:46.840> as<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> butter<00:01:47.290> yet<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.190> again<00:01:48.460> we're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
want as a butter yet so again we're

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.280 
want as a butter yet so again we're
going<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.909> add<00:01:49.060> another<00:01:49.210> tablespoon<00:01:49.570> full<00:01:50.170> of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
going to add another tablespoon full of

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.890 
going to add another tablespoon full of
oil<00:01:50.470> we<00:01:51.460> won't<00:01:51.670> add<00:01:51.820> any<00:01:51.850> salt<00:01:52.270> yet<00:01:52.600> but<00:01:52.810> we

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
oil we won't add any salt yet but we

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.480 
oil we won't add any salt yet but we
will<00:01:52.930> add<00:01:53.170> salt<00:01:53.440> towards<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.950> end<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.280> give<00:01:54.400> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
will add salt towards the end to give it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.280 
will add salt towards the end to give it
