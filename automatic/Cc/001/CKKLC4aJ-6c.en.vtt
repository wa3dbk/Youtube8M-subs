00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.509
 nature now we will pass to the damage 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 me for money problems 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.029
 always talking about the game I don't have 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.619
 continued with that damage too 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:37.590
 because I have to do myself premier anyway 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:40.230
 then first of all let's go to see i 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 powers like plants we have to put 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.730
 only vine lashing so that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 so you can throw it on yours 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.789
 enemies 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 and while you build it you fill it 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 net of blows this writes will continue 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.309
 to do him harm then for how much 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.309
 it concerns shapeshifting power these are the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.549
 skill and to put shiny vito formats 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.159
 original fury, form of a dog and a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.830
 fine but rather hypothetical carnage 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:22.300
 ironic you have to turn a new veil 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.300
 tactical genius weapon specialist 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.450
 I didn't put it yet I didn't put it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.340
 up for strength because i was wrong a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.070
 distribute the skills so instead of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 put these things empathically power 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.610
 thaumaturgical you must put up by force 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.300
 and having seen the jeep then put armor of 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.000
 nanotextile powerful strength like 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.160
 called first botta of nouvelle home 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.860
 intimidating look the wisdom of 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.370
 Solomon and his own tactical genius e 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.610
 good weapons specialist 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.940
 as for skills i like 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.270
 weapon I recommend the rifle because it is 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.270
 very convenient to put all the skills 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.550
 valentia 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.280
 oh well I have to reset it so it is 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.900
 useless for the skill points 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:37.260
 but this is ok and for what concerns 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.530
 the rifle then with regard to the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.880
 flight mode I know its pole e 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.960
 put all ages and then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.360
 supersonic attack and dive not 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.470
 there is a cock but resistance to the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 constitution resistance to stunning 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.290
 lego construction recovery 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.120
 absorption and finally but and mastery 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.520
 in the evasion that gives you strength when 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.380
 do your own good shift prizes 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.070
 run away ok 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 and that's all for having a powerful one 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.810
 character give in dc universe as 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.540
 nature 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 then deception these are the skills from 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 put on the first batch in the whipped tour 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.710
 of vital npc na botta of nine norm 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.540
 fury and if the form of owl tell you that 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.320
 when sitting in combat is in pvp 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.780
 fill and transform yourself into a 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.780
 wolf and put them lousy first roar 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.000
 then return to normal 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.430
 put in the slot where the fucking bar is 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.770
 tasted of life then carnage bacteria 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.600
 novero and fury 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.430
 before starting an attack for example 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.290
 in one place I advise you to activate 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.200
 both carnage and bang of now renault 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.040
 which gives you much strength and a lot of power e 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.030
 so you can do much more damage 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.800
 attached your character with 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.590
 tart life and then filled 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.600
 blows in the form of wolves with fists 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.310
 and this is all 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.200
 I hope I have been helpful
