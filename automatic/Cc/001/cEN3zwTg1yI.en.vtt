 I'll continue with the following is the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.400
 same process that I do to all of you 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.910

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.730
 and eyes as they say mites well this 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.250
 yesterday dust city well then so 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.560
 regular where they attack a lot the option was 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.940
 the race in the feathers start to 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.440
 eat it 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.840
 they start eating them 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.580
 they begin to damage the pen where it is where 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.230
 the pen begins to be born, that's where 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:27.690
 begins to attack the louse and begin 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.700
 here apply the asian feather eat 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.760
 the blood of the birds good here already 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.460
 we have the second 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.790
 these are my pups of 2015 that I 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.430
 they were born 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.230
 the yellow ones with white 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.090
 and two whites and two whites 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.170
 completely look to see if with this 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.730
 Yellow is reached to appreciate a 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.730
 little more 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.780
 this is what I do 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.530
 Well now I just have to do 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.530
 every four months 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.650
 it's like they are little they have the 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.540
 louse leg is easy to minutes 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.540
 they have the assignment in hand 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.480
 they are very easy to be attacked by 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.110
 mites here in and this is where I have my 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.540
 ball of all my channels because I do not have 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.800
 when we had a problem with those with 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.680
 the lice but it's always good this 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.180
 prevent years from here and I know that 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.180
 is attentive to how to do it together 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.320
 this as brought d 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.810
 from Tijuana 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.810
 I do not know if here in any store 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.789
 fences have but flying looking and not 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.949
 I was brought from Tijuana last year 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:02.000
 and then all the great also 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.100
 He applied them in hot weather because 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.969
 they say that regularly in the time of 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.809
 heat is when 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.769
 when the old man begins to appear more 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.739
 in the birds 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:17.009
 look here if you can not see the 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:20.000
 video with a month as I keep the arch 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:23.240
 all right 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.980
 select a line very small and 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.630
 then they are already here and both 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.640
 channels already have their talc football not 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.790
 I put them on because they are already put 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.000
 nine days old but as they 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.140
 I say is football has that area is the 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.660
 owns the last month every four hour 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:48.660
 months I'll put it back if it's him 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.160
 is the insecticide powder dust look 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.420
 has a canary drawn this powder 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.060
 it's for lice 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.880
 Well that's a recommendation from 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.700
 vague pri placed with my canaries and that 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.240
 is what I do to prevent them 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.410
 that the lice do not attack us here 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.410
 we can see it and here it is already here they are 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.330
 with the one with the mom I put them in this 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.700
 big cage because there's dad already has 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.249
 our canary the floor and already has it 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.779
 cast then 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:25.209
 so that they are taught to fly a little more 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:27.009
 freely when the type of 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:30.479
 posture then removed all the cages 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.479
 and he left them free
