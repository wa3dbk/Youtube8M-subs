 the water cannons towards the end on it 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.590
 So we have 850 officers in action 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 the federal police had 450 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.399
 Colleagues in action for the station for 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.020
 the transport and already a huge 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.670
 number for a finished play 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.229

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 Offenbach forest farm 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 there was an incident in 1999 amberg where it was too 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.450
 come very serious expulsions 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 is that one also in advance in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.509
 corresponding forums again and again 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 has published and has been there as well 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.929
 bit up on the whole 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.180
 history so that we realized that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.799
 we have to perform massively here today 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.049
 a direct confrontation between the 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.019
 was searched for then yes 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.859
 seen and our concept is 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.810

 in the train to Hessen 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.439
 Unfortunately, the appeals of the clubs and 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.359
 the police to renounce violence 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.409
 again with the hardcore rioters 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.409
