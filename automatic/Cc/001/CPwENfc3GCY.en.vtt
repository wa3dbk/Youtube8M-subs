pretty more than I think it will be in
the<00:02:48.299> future<00:02:49.010> yeah<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.519> enough<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
pretty cool then they're going to have

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.039 
pretty cool then they're going to have
some<00:03:09.870> levels<00:03:10.470> which<00:03:10.739> aren't<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.310> linear<00:03:12.049> so

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
some levels which aren't as linear so

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.580 
some levels which aren't as linear so
it's<00:03:13.769> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.310> an<00:03:14.489> open<00:03:14.760> map

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
it's going to be like an open map

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
it's going to be like an open map
mysterious<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.769> two<00:03:16.950> objectives<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:18.299> right

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
mysterious when two objectives all right

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
mysterious when two objectives all right
I<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.109> lot<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.440> people<00:03:19.560> complain<00:03:20.220> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
I think a lot of people complain that
cop<00:03:20.609> when<00:03:20.790> people<00:03:21.060> say<00:03:21.180> God<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.690> less<00:03:22.049> linear

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
cop when people say God is less linear

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.449 
cop when people say God is less linear
like<00:03:22.739> that's<00:03:23.370> not<00:03:23.780> right<00:03:24.780> there's<00:03:25.590> also<00:03:25.769> some
