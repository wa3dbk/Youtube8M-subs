00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:07.733
 Another technique to improve typing speed is called "filling." 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.009
 Some words at the beginning of the two are 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.125
 "horizontal" and "vertical" 

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.017
 Or there are more words in the word "door". 

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:18.079
 Or you don't know 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.669
 The words you need to type 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.433
 Will it be placed in a later position? 

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.638
 We can finish the stroke of the word, 

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.724
 Press the number key 

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:31.847

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:37.011
 Press the first English letter of the word again. 

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:40.709
 You can find the words you need faster. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.248
 For example, 

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:43.868
 For example, put a word "mai", 

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.662
 The first stroke is "horizontal". 

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:47.401
 The second pen is "vertical". 

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.123
 Everyone knows, 

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:50.853
 a "horizontal" and a "vertical" 

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:53.635
 Press "8" and press "Select". 

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:55.463

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.943

00:00:58.063 --> 00:00:59.060
 Press "Next Page" again. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.249
 Press "Next Page" again. 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.439
 Press "Next Page" again. 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.660
 Press "Next Page" again. 

00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:04.582
 You will find the word "麦". But when we pressed 

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.053
 One "horizontal" and then a "vertical" 

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:13.296
 Press "0" to select the word. 

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:19.833
 Then press the "+" button on the right side of the keyboard. 

00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:23.594
 Can now be seen in the window 

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:26.724
 English letters appear, 

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:28.866
 Please note, 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.935
 If the required letters are in the same square, 

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:36.221
 You only need to press this button. 

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:37.328
 E.g, 

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.573
 a,b,c 

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:40.210
 All in the "8" key, 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.251
 If you want to press "c", 

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:45.326
 You just need to press the "8" button. 

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:47.193
 Don't have to press three times. 

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.270
 Let’s talk about the word "mai". 

00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:51.547
 After pressing "horizontal" and "vertical", 

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:55.916
 You can add the pronunciation of "麦" 

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:59.147
 The first English letter "m", 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.658
 "m" corresponds to the "6" key. 

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:06.139
 So click on the "6" button. 

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:10.359
 Then you can find the word "麦" soon. 

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.592
 The same reason is to make an "ear" word. 

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.477
 After pressing "horizontal" and "vertical", 

00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:16.819
 Click the "+" sign. 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.496
 Then select the first pronunciation of the word "ear" 

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.458

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:26.461
 After the word "bean" is finished, press the "+" sign. 

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:30.739
 Press the first English letter "d" of the word "bean" 

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.477
