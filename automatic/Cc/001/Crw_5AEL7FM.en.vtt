oh this is Liana the computer room not
again<00:00:02.520> what<00:00:02.730> I've<00:00:02.820> got<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:04.609> MacBook

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
again what I've got here is a MacBook

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.980 
again what I've got here is a MacBook
Pro<00:00:05.810> Apple<00:00:06.810> MacBook<00:00:07.350> Pro<00:00:07.820> obviously<00:00:08.820> now<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
Pro Apple MacBook Pro obviously now the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.330 
Pro Apple MacBook Pro obviously now the
issue<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:12.170> kind<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> not<00:00:13.349> very<00:00:13.530> stable<00:00:13.740> at<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
issue is kind of not very stable at the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.359 
issue is kind of not very stable at the
moment<00:00:14.670> as<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.830> all<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
moment as it is all I'm going to do is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.330 
moment as it is all I'm going to do is
open<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:19.670> make<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.470> reader<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:23.130> more

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
open it up make the reader a bit more

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240 
open it up make the reader a bit more
obvious<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.470> mouse<00:00:25.949> by<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
obvious this is the mouse by the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
obvious this is the mouse by the
trackpad<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:27.420> forced<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.080> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
trackpad but it's been forced out so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
trackpad but it's been forced out so
there's<00:00:29.039> something<00:00:29.250> underneath<00:00:29.849> pushing<00:00:30.599> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
there's something underneath pushing it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.240 
there's something underneath pushing it
up<00:00:31.460> if<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.579> turn<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.000> also<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.040> big

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
up if we turn it over also see the big

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
up if we turn it over also see the big
shape<00:00:37.969> it's<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.510> sort<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> bumped<00:00:40.440> for

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
shape it's just that sort of bumped for

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.880 
shape it's just that sort of bumped for
that<00:00:41.570> that's<00:00:42.570> been<00:00:42.840> pushed<00:00:43.079> downwards<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that that's been pushed downwards I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
that that's been pushed downwards I
essentially<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.460> downwards<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> it's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
essentially it downwards what it is it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.040 
essentially it downwards what it is it's
the<00:00:46.350> battery<00:00:46.770> occupies<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.030> part<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the battery occupies this part of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
the battery occupies this part of
microprobe<00:00:49.860> underneath<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.760> cover<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
microprobe underneath this cover it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.660 
microprobe underneath this cover it's
swollen<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.070> what's<00:00:53.280> causing<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
swollen so that's what's causing the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
swollen so that's what's causing the
problem<00:00:54.110> what<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> get

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
problem what will go down when you get

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.029 
problem what will go down when you get
the<00:00:56.449> get<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> cover<00:00:58.170> I've<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> battery

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the get this cover I've got the battery

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
the get this cover I've got the battery
out<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.420> everything<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.140> relax<00:01:01.440> make

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
out so that everything can relax make

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.149 
out so that everything can relax make
sure<00:01:02.250> there's<00:01:02.579> no<00:01:02.730> damage<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:04.159> trackpad

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
sure there's no damage to the trackpad

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
sure there's no damage to the trackpad
and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.360> replacing<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and then just go about replacing the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.630 
and then just go about replacing the
battery<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.650> we're<00:01:07.860> inside<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> mother<00:01:08.430> book

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
battery so we're inside the mother book

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
battery so we're inside the mother book
pro<00:01:08.939> we've<00:01:09.150> got<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> cover<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.439> it's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pro we've got the cover off and now it's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.090 
pro we've got the cover off and now it's
been<00:01:10.740> taken<00:01:10.979> off<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:13.409> shape<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
been taken off the the shape of it is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
been taken off the the shape of it is
flatter<00:01:15.979> would<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.390> go<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> shake<00:01:18.869> mainly

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
flatter would you go to shake mainly

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310 
flatter would you go to shake mainly
because<00:01:20.460> there's<00:01:20.790> no<00:01:20.909> false<00:01:21.270> accent<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.049> from

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
because there's no false accent now from

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
because there's no false accent now from
the<00:01:22.439> inside<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.840> battery<00:01:26.299> never

we've<00:02:06.070> got<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.369> out<00:02:06.490> now<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:07.450> mass<00:02:07.780> part

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
we've got that out now the mass part

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.229 
we've got that out now the mass part
we'll<00:02:08.259> just<00:02:08.410> turn<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.709> over<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.610> back<00:02:10.060> in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
we'll just turn this over it is back in

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.170 
we'll just turn this over it is back in
place<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:11.140> clicks<00:02:11.530> again<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.850> what<00:02:12.970> I'm<00:02:13.030> going

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
place it clicks again so what I'm going

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.199 
place it clicks again so what I'm going
to<00:02:13.209> do<00:02:13.360> now<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.319> get<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.800> bunch<00:02:15.310> refitted
