spike<00:02:41.630> mines<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.710> always<00:02:43.160> thought<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> looked

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
spike mines I always thought it looked

spike mines I always thought it looked
like<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.730> mouse<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.250> course<00:02:46.490> if<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.730> touch

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
like a mouse and of course if you touch

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.850 
like a mouse and of course if you touch
that<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:54.500> yeah<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.770> Rat<00:02:54.920> King<00:02:54.950> he's<00:02:56.800> kind<00:02:57.800> of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
that but yeah the Rat King he's kind of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.610 
that but yeah the Rat King he's kind of
a<00:02:57.950> mercenary<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.730> guess<00:02:59.090> it<00:03:00.050> doesn't<00:03:00.260> always

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
a mercenary I guess it doesn't always

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.470 
a mercenary I guess it doesn't always
