ever I love that they made a cameo the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.850 
ever I love that they made a cameo the
shaggin<00:03:16.910> wagon<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.390> Dumb<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.750> Dumber<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.020> and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
shaggin wagon in Dumb and Dumber to and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.220 
shaggin wagon in Dumb and Dumber to and
it<00:03:19.820> literally<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.330> was<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:20.870> there<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.200> a

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
it literally just was like there for a

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.870 
it literally just was like there for a
second<00:03:21.650> was<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:21.950> funny<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.460> then<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.730> last

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
second was so funny and then the last

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.420 
second was so funny and then the last
one<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.270> comparative<00:03:23.570> purposes<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:25.010> liners

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
one for comparative purposes the liners

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.710 
one for comparative purposes the liners
are<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.690> Air<00:03:26.840> Jordan<00:03:26.920> 10<00:03:27.920> liner<00:03:28.460> and<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.690> I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
are the Air Jordan 10 liner and so I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.970 
are the Air Jordan 10 liner and so I
have<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.020> Chicago<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:32.510> or<00:03:32.750> its<00:03:32.870> Chicago<00:03:33.770> ones

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
have the Chicago one or its Chicago ones

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
have the Chicago one or its Chicago ones
Chicago<00:03:34.370> tens<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.270> can<00:03:35.420> see<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.660> is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
Chicago tens and you can see it is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.320 
Chicago tens and you can see it is
pretty<00:03:36.080> much<00:03:36.110> exactly<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.950> same<00:03:37.250> sort<00:03:38.210> of

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
pretty much exactly the same sort of

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.850 
pretty much exactly the same sort of
checkered<00:03:38.660> look<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.200> them<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.470> that's<00:03:39.650> kind<00:03:39.830> of

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
checkered look to them so that's kind of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.490 
checkered look to them so that's kind of
cool<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.250> thought<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:41.000> don't<00:03:41.750> know<00:03:41.900> necessarily

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
cool I thought I don't know necessarily

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.320 
cool I thought I don't know necessarily
why<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.370> where<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.760> guys<00:03:43.940> let<00:03:44.300> me

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
why and this is where you guys let me

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.300 
why and this is where you guys let me
know<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.990> comments<00:03:45.350> section<00:03:45.620> why<00:03:46.250> is

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
know like in the comments section why is

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.310 
know like in the comments section why is
it<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.730> Chicago<00:03:46.880> liner<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.840> then<00:03:47.990> in<00:03:48.140> New

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
it the Chicago liner and then in New

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.370 
it the Chicago liner and then in New
York<00:03:48.530> inspired<00:03:49.360> streets<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:50.660> kind<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.960> funny

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
York inspired streets it's kind of funny

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.990 
York inspired streets it's kind of funny
because<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:51.710> like<00:03:51.740> both<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:52.790> wanted

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
because it's like both but just wanted

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.920 
because it's like both but just wanted
to<00:03:53.030> throw<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.240> out<00:03:53.360> there<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.600> didn't<00:03:53.840> know

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
to throw that out there I didn't know

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.750 
to throw that out there I didn't know
the<00:03:54.080> reasoning<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.620> maybe<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.310> guys<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.670> do

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
the reasoning and maybe you guys can do

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.970 
the reasoning and maybe you guys can do
some<00:03:55.910> research<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.300> find<00:03:56.930> out<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.320> do<00:03:57.530> like<00:03:57.830> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
some research and find out I do like the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.380 
some research and find out I do like the
fact<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.220> these<00:03:58.370> two<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.610> icy<00:03:58.880> soles<00:03:59.120> on

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
fact that these two have icy soles on

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390 
fact that these two have icy soles on
the<00:03:59.450> bottom<00:03:59.900> some<00:04:00.440> people<00:04:00.680> did<00:04:00.860> not<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.220> that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
the bottom some people did not like that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.250 
the bottom some people did not like that
but<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.760> course<00:04:02.000> I'm<00:04:02.660> always<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.930> sucker<00:04:03.110> for

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
but of course I'm always a sucker for

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.140 
but of course I'm always a sucker for
the<00:04:03.380> icy<00:04:03.560> soles<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.460> has<00:04:04.970> no

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the icy soles and this one has no

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.850 
the icy soles and this one has no
exception<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.870> really<00:04:06.050> liked<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.710> overall

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
exception I really liked the overall

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.770 
exception I really liked the overall
look<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.310> loved<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.610> hit<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> patent<00:04:08.180> leather<00:04:08.360> on

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
look I loved the hit a patent leather on

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.830 
look I loved the hit a patent leather on
the<00:04:09.020> swoosh<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:10.390> circles<00:04:11.390> back<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.600> the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
the swoosh and circles back to the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.770 
the swoosh and circles back to the
pull-tab<00:04:12.460> the<00:04:13.460> tongue<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:14.000> like<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.690> it's

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
pull-tab the tongue I like that it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.400 
pull-tab the tongue I like that it's
kind<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.020> as<00:04:15.110> matte<00:04:15.290> red<00:04:15.500> color<00:04:16.340> says<00:04:16.640> dunk<00:04:17.410> pro

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
kind of as matte red color says dunk pro

kind of as matte red color says dunk pro
or<00:04:18.709> dunk<00:04:19.670> high<00:04:19.850> pro<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.540> then<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> Nike<00:04:21.109> SB

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
embossed right there but all in all just

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.110 
embossed right there but all in all just
a<00:04:24.530> really<00:04:24.560> simple<00:04:25.040> clean<00:04:25.520> looking<00:04:25.820> pair<00:04:26.030> of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
a really simple clean looking pair of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.330 
a really simple clean looking pair of
sneakers<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.690> did<00:04:27.140> lace<00:04:27.919> them<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.160> little

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
sneakers I did lace them a little

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.920 
sneakers I did lace them a little
differently<00:04:28.610> both<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.150> if<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.540> guys<00:04:29.660> didn't

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
differently both and if you guys didn't

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.120 
differently both and if you guys didn't
notice<00:04:30.050> it's<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.530> those<00:04:30.590> subtle<00:04:30.950> things

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
notice it's one of those subtle things

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.440 
notice it's one of those subtle things
that<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.280> try<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.550> do<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.970> videos

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
that I try to do in the videos

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.570 
that I try to do in the videos
from<00:04:32.840> time<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.050> time<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:34.040> waste<00:04:34.370> them<00:04:34.550> a

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
from time to time is just waste them a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.920 
from time to time is just waste them a
little<00:04:34.760> bit<00:04:34.850> differently

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
little bit differently

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.780 
little bit differently
I<00:04:35.990> like<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.680> dead<00:04:36.860> stock<00:04:37.100> lace<00:04:37.340> personally

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
I like the dead stock lace personally

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.340 
I like the dead stock lace personally
just<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.090> look<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.510> in<00:04:38.630> general<00:04:39.170> but<00:04:39.290> I

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
just the look of it in general but I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.050 
just the look of it in general but I
lace<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.890> lower<00:04:40.070> on<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.370> one<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.790> straps

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
lace it lower on this one so the straps

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.880 
lace it lower on this one so the straps
kind<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.360> hang<00:04:41.510> sometimes<00:04:42.170> on<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.410> dunks<00:04:42.680> on

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
kind of hang sometimes on the dunks on

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.350 
kind of hang sometimes on the dunks on
the<00:04:43.160> dunk<00:04:43.340> highs<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.700> particularly<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.330> like

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
the dunk highs in particularly I like

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.240 
the dunk highs in particularly I like
the<00:04:44.660> straps<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.140> kind<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.380> hang<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.800> little<00:04:46.160> bit

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
the straps to kind of hang a little bit

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.220 
the straps to kind of hang a little bit
loose<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.510> me<00:04:47.540> was<00:04:47.780> one<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.020> best
