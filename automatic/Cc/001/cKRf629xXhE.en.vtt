00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
multi-tap modulation delay it's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.770 
multi-tap modulation delay it's
basically<00:01:10.759> got<00:01:11.030> everything<00:01:11.479> but<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.659> kitchen

superimposed on each other I'm going to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.350 
superimposed on each other I'm going to
create<00:01:48.349> some<00:01:48.530> really<00:01:48.709> beautiful<00:01:49.030> spread<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
create some really beautiful spread and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.449 
create some really beautiful spread and

wash and ambience sounds really this

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.180 
wash and ambience sounds really this
thing<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.819> sound<00:01:53.239> design<00:01:53.629> machine<00:01:54.190> every

single algorithm and function of the
ecolution<00:01:57.619> too<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:58.129> be<00:01:58.250> run<00:01:58.429> simultaneously

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
ecolution too can be run simultaneously

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.330 
ecolution too can be run simultaneously
if<00:01:59.569> you<00:01:59.690> so<00:01:59.929> desire<00:02:00.319> so<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:00.979> can<00:02:01.160> basically

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
if you so desire so you can basically

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.510 
if you so desire so you can basically
pick<00:02:01.849> and<00:02:02.060> choose<00:02:02.300> your<00:02:02.660> own<00:02:03.170> sound<00:02:04.160> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
pick and choose your own sound and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.949 
pick and choose your own sound and
create<00:02:04.819> things<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.209> have<00:02:05.390> never<00:02:05.509> been<00:02:05.780> made

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
create things that have never been made

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.749 
create things that have never been made
before<00:02:05.989> because<00:02:06.739> of<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.069> intense<00:02:07.369> amount<00:02:07.670> of

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
before because of the intense amount of

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.279 
before because of the intense amount of
processing<00:02:07.940> power<00:02:08.300> that's<00:02:08.720> built<00:02:08.959> into<00:02:09.140> this

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
processing power that's built into this

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.650 
processing power that's built into this
thing<00:02:09.560> there's<00:02:10.369> two<00:02:10.700> versions<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.300> pedal

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
thing there's two versions of the pedal

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.119 
thing there's two versions of the pedal
there's<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.989> ecolution<00:02:12.349> too<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
there's the ecolution too and the

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.670 
there's the ecolution too and the
ecolution<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.879> deluxe<00:02:14.239> both<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.319> them<00:02:15.500> are

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
ecolution to deluxe both of them are

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.759 
ecolution to deluxe both of them are
capable<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.090> same<00:02:17.330> sounds<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.260> just

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
capable of all the same sounds it's just

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.309 
capable of all the same sounds it's just
that<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> ecolution<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.700> deluxe<00:02:20.060> pulls<00:02:20.930> all

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
that the ecolution to deluxe pulls all

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.470 
that the ecolution to deluxe pulls all
of<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> editing<00:02:22.069> features<00:02:22.519> up<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.330> front
