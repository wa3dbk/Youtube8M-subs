00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.460
 very good everyone here I present to you 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:11.200
 guys version number 2 for the guide 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.509
 the escapist I updated to alpha 07 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.080
 53 which is the last version that 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.850
 currently brings the game voucher for 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.500
 do this guide guys I've based here 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.870
 come up here guys on this page 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.270
 web that prevented me based also on 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.060
 google in my personal experience when 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.300
 they are playing more collaborative than I have 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.670
 had on behalf of users is worth the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.630
 good translation because it has been whole 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.780
 made by me with what then 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.329
 there will probably be mistakes that included 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.390
 in this version with respect to the previous 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.840
 that climbed guys first thing more 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.970
 character is worth this version included 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.230
 new elements that could be created with 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.360
 which we are going against more craft and 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:58.010
 or icons 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.270
 to better identify the objects worth 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.290
 with which good so here we are going to see 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.270
 that practically my mother what so 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 practically except these two that I've 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.410
 achieved the icon guys practically 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
 everything has its icon there with which I 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.120
 I think it's going to be 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.560
 much easier to locate the object 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.760
 that we want is worth sometimes not for the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.100
 name of the same name by the icon 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.930
 the same is more simple, it is also worth 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.420
 intended apart from including this guide 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.650
 of craft guys has also tried 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.220
 include or add something that you consider 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.930
 that could be useful for the game and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
 For this, for example, I included the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.620
 prison regime that I believe that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.260
 It can be quite interesting 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.660
 what is it that needs to be done every hour 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.190
 according to the criterion or 'only according to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.509
 regime that has one's own 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.400
 jail and that I must fulfill as 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.140
 prisoner is worth everything, since that is 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.490
 we are planning our escape in what 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.590
 we have to start doing 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 something or not good because here we have 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.430
 a little regime that I think is 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 quite pretty is quite intuitive 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.119
 and quite easy to understand too 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.860
 included guys a little bit the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.080
 description of the jobs we have 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.300
 and as I said before with the version 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.340
 07 53 that already includes the new job 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.259
 which is the kitchen is worth with which 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.750
 Well, here I try a little 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.070
 detail what is to be done and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 then also if you can do something 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.490
 inside for example the battery so that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.170
 you can steal clothes 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.460
 but says that good because a little that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.080
 is what you have to do to 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.730
 try to get caught in the workshop 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.770
 what can be done in the metal shop 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.570
 Well, here we would explain a 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.920
 little work that currently 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.020
 has the game favors guys that's 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.730
 still a little green is worth not 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.260
 very much time and a million very much 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 time the truth update to update 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.720
 all this because I touch look for a lot 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.510
 information I have to translate it and everything 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 that place it to frame the good then 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 well then please this for now I have 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.970
 located these three that are retrieve 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.650
 which is to get a vital object that is 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.180
 hit someone I think it's up 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.130
 knock it down I think you'll have this 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.230
 to confirm yourselves or create a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.210
 distraction is worth it with distraction I know that 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.710
 there are more favors guys if you give me time 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.070
 then for the next version that goes up 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.450
 of this game I'll add it more add 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.460
 keep adding things to the guide to 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.710
 that is useful for everyone who is more 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.050
 has added guys because a section of 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.040
 objects in which good then we have 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.380
 here 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.590
 tools is worth for example the crowbar 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.260
 and here comes for example 3 out of 5 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.810
 that as a weapon in a rating of 1 in 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.190
 5 would be at the point 3 voucher or for 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.290
 undermine walls 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.750
 in a rating of 15 have a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.650
 score of 2 and it's illegal worth here what 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.570
 it also marked 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.070
 that means that if they ask us what 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.110
 remove 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.900
 the plastic fork well then here 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.060
 come their 1 of 5 1 of 5 and it's legal 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.280
 Well here come a little the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.610
 qualities and characteristics of each 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.020
 of the tools is worth and then by 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.460
 last guys weapons 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.310
 I wanted to do the same with the 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.310
 issue of weapons and also comes its 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 qualities 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.500
 of strength and more of the weapons there 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.110
 thousand this I forgot this is five 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.460
 of five is worth when then this pdf what 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.310
 you are going to have the description of the video 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.000
 ok and you will have it already uploaded with 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.610
 modified this because this I have 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.560
 put 5 out of 5 would I think that remembering is 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.959
 the best weapon 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.849
 that there is currently in the game is worth 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.610
 even on the novilleras 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.510
 iron guys that would be level 4 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.799
 OK 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.919
 logically all this is illegal by 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.030
 example the pil or the lomada is legal 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.350
 almada as arba and the teddy bear is equal 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.730
 to drown someone 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.960
 I know it good guys also good 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.520
 as a weapon it is also used then the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.770
 fork the knife 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.450
 the screwdriver and of course the mace 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.370
 this wonderful also that we have 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.920

 knife this also guys look at and the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.409
 whip would also have the valuation of 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.710
 5 out of 5 guys the whip and the nunchuk 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.409
 right now in fight that would be the most 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.340
 strong in the game I left here a 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.389
