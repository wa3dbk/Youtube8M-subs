00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.690
 Hi guys, I'm 188 and today we're going to 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.310
 make a really good breeding paste for 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.330
 that our chicks that are strong 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.190
 healthy and with a spectacular plumage the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.440
 ingredients are the following calcium 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.850
 a cookie and make it as I can not 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:40.269
 say I give you a clue 1 1 2 3 a little step 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.790
 p'alante 1 2 3 a little step back 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.770
 half boiled egg and central dough 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.820
 of breeding in case of not having pasta 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.660
 Bread bread is worth not we started 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.840
 The first thing we need is a bowl 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 tiny bowl to be able to mix all the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.690
 grated a grater a tiny colander and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.970
 a spoon either large or 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 as small as you do better 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.590
 me in this case with a little girl 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.060
 also important lukewarm warm water 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.100
 already pre-heated in the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.510
 microwave one minute the first thing that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
 let's do 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.300
 is to strain the breeding paste with this 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.590
 we will avoid getting stuck in 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 syringe that has happened to many 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.380
 in the group that we have in diamond the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.120
 mandarin is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 what is this group's facebook 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.710
 Well, people comment to me, they treat me 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.620
 the syringe to which you are 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.320
 character and clear girl gets stuck for this 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.490
 reason I smell it and see what's left 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.890
 remains these remains are vitamins 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.720
 the vitamins that the pasta has and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 goodies so to speak that gives you that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 flavor that they like so much 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.140
 birds 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.590
 and this is how we are left in the form of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.790
 as if it were a couscous or a week with 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.250
 is with this mixture is enough 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.020
 instead of what we have discarded in the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.930
 strainer that we do not throw it away what 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.850
 we use to then put it on 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.250
 the vizcacheras to the other birds to 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.710
 the biggest ones who already eat alone 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.400
 we take and proceed to grate the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.049
 calcium is worth 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.319
 We will also grate the calcium with 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.150
 the strainer the debris I have returned to 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.770
 throw here because then they eat it 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 other birds 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.540
 we would give you a little tiqui tiqui tiqui 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.000
 tiqui tiqui tiqui this not much either 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.730
 it's because an excess of calcium also 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.760
 it can give them a little bit of diarrhea 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.580
 we split and scored raca raca raca 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.620
 and if you have a grater because scratches 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.579
 all with the strainer and a very silly 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.640
 silly 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.430
 well then if the radio the cookie 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.870
 the in the colander 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.150
 it stays much thinner 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.640
 However, if the line on the grater is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.500
 large chunks remain that then when 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.170
 got into the water they dissolve but they 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.840
 the dough is more pasty maybe 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.909
 good good the one of the grills of cayÃ³n 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.489
 it is not convenient we go and now yes now 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.980
 we will use the grater for the egg 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.300
 many do it with their own clear 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.190
 as well 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 but I just put the yolk just like 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.480
 media called because the pasta already if 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.610
 Take your protein and scratch slowly 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 with patience and good handwriting what 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.780
 do it with love you can say crazy 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.940
 could you tell me what you want but if 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.740
 things are done with love 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 I believe that later they know better because average 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.460
 we are going to take a rayadito 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.730
 napkin we are going to clean our fingers 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.920
 and well the mixture of water the mixture of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.470
 water I use a syringe and soil 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.020
 put three syringes for the mixture 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.020
 that we have done one two and three 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.689
 but also tell you that if you believe 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.109
 convenient to warm it up 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.879
 quite what is water 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.409
 you can do it because this pasta is 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.740
 chill right away it's like baby food 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.660
 the babies 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.550
 this in when you remove it a little in 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.890
 followed stays cold 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.810
 at the beginning the three syringes are 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.020
 there is a very very watery mass very 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.489
 liquid worth 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.860
 but if we let a little rest 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.460
 pasta and the cookie begin to suck the 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.320
 liquid and it is expressing you said the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.000
 water the water can heat up even 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.680
 almost to boil because it 's convenient 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.080
 when you put egg yolk on it because 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.050
 so somebody the egg falls apart 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.130
 undo and it's much more much easier 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.600
 then when filling out the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.080
 syringes and after listening to them 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.910
 then also when they are very tiny 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.580
 it is not advisable to add calcium 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.890
 is or put it on when they already carry 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.610
 better two two and a half weeks three 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.159
 weeks of 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.780
 of growth the chicks because 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.840
 Can you give a diarrhea? Can you? Can you? 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.580
 sit down well let's go 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.750
 the calcium put it to game when you 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.400
 the first pens begin to come out 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.280
 this is going to go on the sticks this 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.600
 they come out before the pen and not when 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.870
 begins to come out what is the pen of 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.870
 true 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.940
 well she is thickening 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.080
 I'm expressing a little bit if you see that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.440
 they do not express themselves at all, more 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.440
 cookies 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.840
 now he is taking body well and with 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.650
 this we can fill a syringe 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.290
 A) Yes 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.050
 we can not fill it, we can 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.990
 fill it because it takes a lot of air and what 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.720
 what it does is when we fight the pigeon what 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.410
 let's fill with air and you will sit 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.690
 the food a little bit more because it has 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.160
 more to go out in the much that food is going 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.139
 last little and digestion is not going to be 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.690
 so fast then what we do is 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.440
 dismantle we apply a little bit of 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.290
 force and it dismantles vale 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.420
 and from here we fill the pasta 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.450
 fill quietly and this to 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.190
 our chicks love how they 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.460
 they go crazy when they see the syringe 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.900
 we give them a syncope it seems that we 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.260
 they come up to the eyes when they see the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.260
 junk 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.639
 and identified and so many to the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.710
 pigeons and feed him his own 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.870
 parents well this is done in case 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.090
 that parents do not feed them 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.220
 beige stuffed syringe when 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.150
 and we get for nothing is the 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.060
 chicks and feed them and little else here 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.550
 my first official video of 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.440
 in quotation marks of how pasta is made 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.150
 of breeding for in many visions so 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.000
 nothing a greeting and the next and 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.640
