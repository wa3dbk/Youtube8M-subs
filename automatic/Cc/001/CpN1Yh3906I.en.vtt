algebra all these higher more evolved
forms<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.110> math<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.640> second

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
forms of math and you go to that second

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.980 
forms of math and you go to that second
grader<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> you're<00:01:24.630> having<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> conversation

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
grader and you're having a conversation

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
grader and you're having a conversation
you've<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.130> second<00:01:26.520> grade<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.880> know

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you've been in second grade you know

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
you've been in second grade you know
exactly<00:01:27.600> where<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.829> were<00:01:29.070> they

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
exactly where you are but you were they

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
exactly where you are but you were they
are<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.659> where<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
are but you know that where they are so

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
are but you know that where they are so
limited<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.130> comparison<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.790> where<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.150> are

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
limited in comparison to where you are

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
limited in comparison to where you are
now<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.380> look<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.860> second

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
now and so you look at that second

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
now and so you look at that second
grader<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> shake<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
grader and you just want to shake the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
grader and you just want to shake the
little<00:01:37.140> kid<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> say<00:01:37.710> you've<00:01:38.490> got<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.820> get

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
little kid and say you've got to get

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
little kid and say you've got to get
into<00:01:39.180> calculus<00:01:39.479> man<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> learn<00:01:41.009> like

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
into calculus man you got to learn like

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
into calculus man you got to learn like
algorithms<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> how<00:01:42.990> ridiculous<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
algorithms think of how ridiculous that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.560 
algorithms think of how ridiculous that
would<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:45.000> talking<00:01:45.240> about

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
would be to start talking about

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
would be to start talking about
everything<00:01:46.140> you're<00:01:46.259> learning<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.710> college

not<00:03:46.769> be<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.250> connection<00:03:47.790> point<00:03:48.329> between<00:03:48.599> you

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
not be a connection point between you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.379 
not be a connection point between you
and<00:03:49.799> people<00:03:50.250> who<00:03:50.459> are<00:03:50.549> not<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.000> spiritual

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
and people who are not on the spiritual

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.150 
and people who are not on the spiritual
path<00:03:51.599> so<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.349> these<00:03:52.500> people<00:03:52.859> are<00:03:52.919> really

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
path so if these people are really

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.309 
path so if these people are really
important<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.090> your<00:03:54.120> life<00:03:54.319> then

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
important to you in your life then

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.530 
important to you in your life then
there's<00:03:55.919> an<00:03:56.160> opportunity<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.940> really<00:03:57.150> look<00:03:57.389> at

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
there's an opportunity to really look at

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.869 
there's an opportunity to really look at
what<00:03:57.599> do<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.440> in<00:03:58.560> common<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.160> what<00:03:59.700> is

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
what do you have in common and what is

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.089 
what do you have in common and what is
that<00:03:59.910> common<00:04:00.480> ground<00:04:00.629> that<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.319> focus<00:04:01.620> on

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
that common ground that you can focus on

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.170 
that common ground that you can focus on
so<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.660> example<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:04.549> let's<00:04:05.549> say<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.700> family

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
so for example if let's say a family

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.119 
so for example if let's say a family
member<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.660> always<00:04:06.930> talking<00:04:07.230> about<00:04:07.440> sports

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
member is always talking about sports

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.369 
member is always talking about sports
and<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.639> happen<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:08.970> love<00:04:09.209> sports<00:04:09.569> then<00:04:10.349> I

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
and you happen to love sports then I

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.280 
and you happen to love sports then I
would<00:04:10.799> just<00:04:11.040> keep<00:04:12.030> gearing<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.569> conversation

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
would just keep gearing the conversation

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.140 
would just keep gearing the conversation
towards<00:04:13.470> sports<00:04:13.919> or<00:04:14.250> let's<00:04:14.730> say<00:04:14.879> you<00:04:14.970> both

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
towards sports or let's say you both

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.120 
towards sports or let's say you both
love<00:04:15.389> comedies<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.169> movies<00:04:16.530> then<00:04:16.739> go<00:04:16.889> see

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
love comedies and movies then go see

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.640 
love comedies and movies then go see
movies<00:04:17.489> together<00:04:17.699> but<00:04:18.660> if<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.989> person<00:04:19.470> is

what<00:05:16.600> is<00:05:16.750> growing<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.889> until<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.610> grows

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
what is growing so that until it grows

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.180 
what is growing so that until it grows
its<00:05:19.210> protected<00:05:19.870> but<00:05:20.410> then<00:05:20.530> once<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:20.949> feel

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
its protected but then once you feel

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.909 
its protected but then once you feel
rooted<00:05:21.430> enough<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:21.970> who<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.270> are<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.919> voicing
