so<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.770> of<00:00:01.829> my<00:00:02.159> octopus<00:00:02.700> tank

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so this is a video of my octopus tank

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.889 
so this is a video of my octopus tank
it's<00:00:03.720> 75<00:00:04.560> gallons<00:00:05.069> acrylic<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:06.359> has<00:00:06.629> an

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
it's 75 gallons acrylic it has an

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.509 
it's 75 gallons acrylic it has an
in-tank<00:00:07.230> filter<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.069> designed

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
in-tank filter that I designed

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.900 
in-tank filter that I designed
specifically<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.809> octopus<00:00:10.429> where<00:00:11.429> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
specifically for the octopus where it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.720 
specifically for the octopus where it's
a<00:00:12.090> 3<00:00:12.660> inch<00:00:12.780> PVC<00:00:13.019> pipe<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.590> runs<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:14.250> end<00:00:14.549> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
a 3 inch PVC pipe that runs into end of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.390 
a 3 inch PVC pipe that runs into end of
the<00:00:14.849> tank<00:00:15.059> where<00:00:15.870> there's<00:00:16.470> elbows<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the tank where there's elbows where it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
the tank where there's elbows where it
goes<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.580> where<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> strainers<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
goes up where the strainers are the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.529 
goes up where the strainers are the
green<00:00:19.170> strainers<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:20.039> top<00:00:20.279> there's<00:00:21.060> sponges

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
green strainers on top there's sponges

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
green strainers on top there's sponges
and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> meets<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.500> bio<00:00:22.859> balls<00:00:23.189> down<00:00:23.490> in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and then it meets the bio balls down in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.679 
and then it meets the bio balls down in
the<00:00:23.730> middle<00:00:24.890> there's<00:00:25.890> also<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.340> REO<00:00:27.000> power<00:00:27.359> head

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the middle there's also a REO power head

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.310 
the middle there's also a REO power head
that<00:00:27.960> pumps<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> water<00:00:29.599> through<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> tank<00:00:31.019> um

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that pumps the water through the tank um

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.670 
that pumps the water through the tank um
it<00:00:32.070> ran<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> little<00:00:32.399> hot<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.059> day<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.200> ended

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it ran a little hot one day so I ended

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.700 
it ran a little hot one day so I ended
up<00:00:34.770> putting<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.309> chiller<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.570> keep<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
up putting a chiller on it I keep the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
up putting a chiller on it I keep the
tank<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.309> 76<00:00:39.300> 77<00:00:40.230> degrees<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.570> see

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
tank in about 76 77 degrees you can see

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
tank in about 76 77 degrees you can see
the<00:00:43.170> tube<00:00:43.559> where<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.950> water<00:00:44.879> goes<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the tube where the water goes to the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
the tube where the water goes to the
chiller<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> middle<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
chiller it's kind of in the middle of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
chiller it's kind of in the middle of
the<00:00:47.340> tank<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:47.910> alright<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.280> octopuses

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the tank but that's alright so octopuses

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.360 
the tank but that's alright so octopuses
are<00:00:50.399> known<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.760> escaping<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.039> lined<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
are known for escaping so I lined the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.770 
are known for escaping so I lined the
tank<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.910> astroturf<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:55.110> outdoor<00:00:55.949> carpeting

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
tank with astroturf or outdoor carpeting

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.849 
tank with astroturf or outdoor carpeting
it<00:00:57.780> lines<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.440> whole<00:00:58.770> tank<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
it lines the whole tank on the top and

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.969 
it lines the whole tank on the top and
then<00:01:01.859> also<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.520> velcro<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.750> lids<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.470> with

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
then also I velcro the lids down with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
then also I velcro the lids down with
some<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.400> astroturf<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.110> any

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
some more astroturf on them on any

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.830 
some more astroturf on them on any
openings<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> tank<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.390> pretty

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
openings of the tank so that's pretty

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620 
openings of the tank so that's pretty
much<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.350> whole<00:01:13.380> tank<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> lot<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> live

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
much the whole tank I got a lot of live

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.320 
much the whole tank I got a lot of live
rock<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> there<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> lot<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> river<00:01:16.920> rock<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.729> few

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
rock in there a lot of river rock a few

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
rock in there a lot of river rock a few

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
final shot of the tank probably my

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.949 
final shot of the tank probably my
favorite<00:02:07.079> tank<00:02:07.320> I've<00:02:07.469> made<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.979> far<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.780> lot<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
favorite tank I've made so far a lot of

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.990
