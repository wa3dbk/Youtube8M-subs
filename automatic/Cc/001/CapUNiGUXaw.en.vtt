00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.170
 I liked and bought a dvd recorder Let's also look at the practice problem earlier, etc. 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 That 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.300
 Child the same way is to it what separately from the face of the example it does not make sense 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.880
 Think as a whole city because just it does not know how much 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.500
 That's the rule of fraction as a rule of 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.149
 as there is a price of about this at all but I do not know dvd recorder some 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.559
 We paid one-eighth of the sum at the same time as purchase 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:40.790
 Old If we must keep a look at say 1 of the end worth against what is always the case of fractional 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.900
 Now I say the total amount or 1/8 of this total 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.060
 About this at the first time 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:53.370
 I was able to pay for one of eight divided the whole of the emotions of 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.430
 The second payment was half of the initial payment 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.970
 Payments for the first time rather than the half of the total amount 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 In other words, I say I divide 1/8 in half 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:08.290
 1/8 divided 2 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:14.170
 1/2 multiplying it fix it to the multiplication is one of the 16 minutes it is not paid about this 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:19.060
 At this point, if you pay the whole hard and hard balance for the third time, it will say how much it will be 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.600
 1 but of 8 minutes total in the first of the entire City 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.280
 Because I drew one-sixteenth of the whole in the second time 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 You will pay the remaining 13/1613/16 in a third time. 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.340
 The 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 Now towards the brackets No. 2 and the first time and the second time of the payment, but I'm the same 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:48.110
 The third payment is only a quarter of the total payment , not the rest 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
 Because it is a quarter of the total payment amount 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.340
 The first round of 4 minutes of 1 and also the second time in a quarter of 1 is also not a whole to piggyback of 1 So this 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.640
 It does not go around payment 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:06.500
 From 13/16, which was left in the previous parentheses City follow and continue the payment of part of the round Mr. 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.000
 Furthermore, it is because the third one gets the whole quarter 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.880
 10 / 163-4 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.970
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 In two minutes, 10 / 163-4 / 16 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 9/16 you can see that that is left after the follow 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:28.530
 It is the third of the practice This is also a pattern of bonus nutrition with 12 payments 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:35.790
 This time I will say that the start of payment is from May 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:39.250
 First payment from May June is a bonus 78-91 is normal payment December is a bonus 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.850
 1234 is such a pattern of regular payment 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:48.670
 In other words, bonus payments are twice in June and December 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:53.620
 It is such a story that there are 10 other so-called regular payments 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.160
 In the 3rd edition of the bracket, I ask for the payment for January, but I can understand it even if I ask only for January 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.020
 Because there is no bonus, I think with the other way with it 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 First of all, 10% of the whole will be paid with the bonus 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:13.849
 Because it pays twice in June place twice in December, it is one-fifth when multiplied 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:18.030
 Therefore 1/5 the entire bonus 1-bonus paid out in the month except bonus 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:22.980
 I have to pay 4/5 of the whole 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:29.700
 Rouge that is, because I'm the reason Rutteyuu in this 4/5 other than the bonus is 10 times 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:33.810
 The problem is that it is a tenth of spending, so 2/25 payments per month 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.110
 Of course in January we are listening to this kind of moon which is not a bonus 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.740
 I know that I pay 2/25 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:47.400
 Then plate in dressed as a practice 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.060
 Say how much the payment has been finished When you have finished the payment of now talk up to 12 May on the premise 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.090
 That's why 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.250
 Of course the remaining 1234 months 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:01.750
 We can calculate by a large amount and pull it from the whole city, but think about it like the amount that we paid now honestly 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:07.360
 Mast first was paid in bonuses twice in June and December 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.319
 Bonus payments are found to be paid one of the entire 5 minutes from the second floor to apply 1/10 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.439
 I will 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.069
 And I will pay 2/25 for the month except bonus, but this is the whole 6 from Maruichi 6 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.660
 Times 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:25.620
 In reason there was a payment is the payment of 12/25 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.100
 Because we have finished paying both of these, the total until December is 1/5 + 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.340
 12/25 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:37.380
 In other words, it is 5/25 + 12/25, so this is totaled 17/25 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.380
 It will be necessary to pay
