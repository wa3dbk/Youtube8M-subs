00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hey, people, how are you? 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 and today I'll bring you one more 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.230
 time and construction hallelujah 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.920
 let's see here joining ep consulting 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.710
 Today the brooklyn bridge is'll tell 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 starting the bomb I'll start talking 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 That's been a lot of work to do. 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 she was one of the ones that gave me the most 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.030
 work our map loads already can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.460
 load will already carry my sky god 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
 Is not this was one of the ones that gave me more 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.629
 work to do because she is very 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.149
 You can see I did not do the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 continued I was even thinking about 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.640
 cut her down here and do only her part 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.469
 here to but not until 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.860
 But all, I did not follow up. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.250
 from then onwards the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.949
 pedestals pedestals not towers you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.260
 You see, I did the cables here. 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:12.930
 bridge got too big 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:16.560
 the other tower has a part is just here 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 a piece of land that is if you are to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.119
 see the real she has a side that is is with 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850
 land that had to be done all 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.900
 here but I did not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 it has the other base on the other item 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.380
 part with the stone is the dress pedestrian in 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 instead of going down the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.409
 inside and underneath nor am I not going 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 explain everything right 6 down and I 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.560
 I really liked the result I liked 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.970
 That's really cool 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 I think it was much cooler than 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 that bridge to goldengate that I did fi 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.270
 as like the same bridge it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.380
 It was a good size did not look like 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 with actual size 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.619
 So I thought it was really cool. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.869
 Seriously, really, and it was a video. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.310
