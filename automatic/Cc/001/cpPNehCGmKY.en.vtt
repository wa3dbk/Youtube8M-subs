00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello I meant tele chamber music artist I don't know 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 because I am beyond the chamber musicians of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.830
 faces and more breezes 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.730
 I don't just know that we can load it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 say alistair burt 0 but yes from the outside 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 umbra vision of all and leo as you have 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.740
 understood from his nice verve but 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.630
 your German to two or what I was 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 saying nothing I want to reject the installments 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.790
 sheikh that you can see in all his 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.320
 practice homonymous rod came out of the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 dead of the undead while I hope that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.590
 comes the plasma that nike shift that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.149
 the other you are looking for in the subject very much 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 this year the undead go bad 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.940
 frame the circle here is of help 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 against 18 of this in the next few 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 these sailors and 200 those around 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 short but the look from the edition of who 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.809
 part my finger instead you want this little 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.579
 the cuticle that the great boxing eaten 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.579
 year as only on sayan boxing 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.909
 quickly the tune of benin e 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.860
 latelli the people that violent stuff e 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.880
 this is the colleague and at the dam 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.259
 meanwhile for your facts more and more 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.460
 little one that cannot be so 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.290
 breaking things will fly all the time 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.509
 St joke causes shit and does not have it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.810
 made clear to play them which power from 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.770
 calamity is powerful, others magnetizing 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.009
 therefore, we feel calamities 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 of the beautiful we proceed but we laugh look 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.009
 the other day I was complaining it's right 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.299
 defend the low but this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.100
 practically non-existent he remembered 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 environment already moment nerve sense is if there 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 look at the base we will see one again 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.270
 base from the we could give from 10 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 let us make a complete tour turns it 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.659
 we put your suit here see the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.450
 ass of you have was not there for that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.909
 to hunt 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 a full snake but then we look at the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.379
 card from the map to the code like 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.979
 you know we cover it you see he is 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.970
 very fast 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.160
 everything here is so fast it makes critics 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.019
 so i think quite standardized by 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 far but much attack however later 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 we try it we see it between 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.220
 very little together with legendary freelander 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.959
 that so far we have seen with Rome is 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.160
 the stranger I said that the effects 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.110
 a lot so I can find dates 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 sheikh and now we see it in we go into 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.540
 action by an undead sect is 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 died neither dead nor just super non 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:44.319
 dead apple has indeed bites and now it 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.870
 let's see, let's take a look 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.079
 bit of all the zoom like how much world 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.239
 nice to the good round accomplice 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:56.590
 he even shoots them fast too 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.000
 word party we also take a moment i 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.329
 Damage to the flight, however, 17 so you put then 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.200
 so 11 with the other with 16 with the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.489
 queue but letter I don't know now 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.560
 we will potentially see in e 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.470
 therefore we will talk about it in the gameplay video 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.970
 since I know if this point will end below 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.700
 the inter verse suborder scube though 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.310
 however you will be able to see unboxing and in 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.560
 play and then subsequently see it 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.150
 even in warcraft for today 15 we can 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.410
 say hello here we hope the actress who 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.730
 there was no disappointment but I don't think so 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.040
 if you have recommended so much then 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.709
 I hope you will put a lot of his thumbs on 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.000
 comments for him seeing that precisely vi 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.060
 we satisfied that it was a lot 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.639
 required for today precisely we stop 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.299
 here from via de leo good continuation there 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.440
 let's see on ubuntu 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.440
 bye Bye
