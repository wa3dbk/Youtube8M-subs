00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.830
 laurent now takes the direction of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.810
 the region of orchies to discover the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.610
 devouring passion of jean-pierre crochon 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 for him parrots and that's it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.710
 his life 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.800
 so much so that he never takes 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.800
 vacation 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.170
 first thing you have jean pierre 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 can not say no I'm gray 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.020
 breeding gabon 3 and three young 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 cook 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 so how old are young young couples 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 couples between 20 and 2 years old it starts to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.650
 to return to the age of 5 from 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 of 55 years old and starts to cool then 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 the gray of the gabon it has a character 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 how then the gray of the gabon is the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.900
 the ultimate pet bird 1 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 it is a bird that is not brilliant 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.150
 it's the least brilliant among 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.479
 parrots it is another who speaks well 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.250
 and hey he is very nice it's a 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.170
 dream he has his character like all 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 parrots but it's up to us or nice 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 pay attention to the beak 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.790
 so we do that because she knows 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.199
 what race then these are harrods 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.290
 buffalo gold bingguo the Latin name and him 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.380
 has and their 7 1 it's an art one to the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 blue and yellow dress 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.770
 these are the most common to this these are 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.310
 birds that are in appendix ii of the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.479
 convention of washington ie 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.430
 the years of the mason and the areas 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.710
 more protected 1 and this 2 they are 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.939
 protected but also more common then 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.409
 we were talking about the gray of the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 gabon ex in small print actually 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280
 each has its character 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.630
 I know it's specific to the species 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.149
 each one's character is unique to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.100
 the species also a good the arrow are the 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.829
 much more sociable birds there 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.899
 accept a whole family when they 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.640
 live in people because against the gray 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.810
 from Gabon he attaches himself to a person in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 general they exclusive then these are 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 animals that actually taste 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.380
 hello you do so beautiful that they 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.270
 come from south american guyane 1-2 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.960
 bray brazil guyana 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 and the buffoon was rather bolivia 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.869
 Colombia 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 so we tend to call ourselves low in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.679
 we do not know the temperature of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.969
 Guyana he adapts perfectly to 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.280
 northern climate no calais which 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.899
 perfectly fits that these zozos are 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 birds born in captivity they are 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 born in more today the birds 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.269

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 the import of the bird is forbidden 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.599
 all over the world and so they 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.489
 adapt to us they adapt from 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.709

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.830
 about twenty years my wife 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.080
 wanted to buy a parrot we went 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.060

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:45.400
 was released several years and was 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.020
 summer in 30 complete bird couples 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.880
 what could you give as 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830
 advice to whoever wants to have a 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.350
 bird like this one do not buy a 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.820

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.889
 do not buy a grandparent father is a 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.710
 dog first look at this is a 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.810
 okay it will take nozuka need space 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.639
 he needs an outdoor aviary he 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.020
 need an aviary one than elsewhere 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.419
 you need a detention authorization 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.950
 to see these birds hold it's a 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.160
 authorization which asked the 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.870
 prefecture is good the dsb comes to 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.090
 you to see if you are fit to 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.160
 hold this bird and when you have 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.930
 more than 10 watts at the request to have 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.370
 a certificate of capacity 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.250
 it's still something else has done yet 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.840
 other thing that it did not happen are 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.669
 more animals that live long 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.460
 so we commit ourselves for a moment of 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.740
 the state ok you have to know that the narodny 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.790

 I can live after you after death he 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.090
 must go there certainly buried this 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.250
 you see your two cases they are very 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.520
