blend these two areas together it's
going<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.030> be<00:02:01.149> great<00:02:01.300> for<00:02:01.720> deer<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.140> for<00:02:02.709> steel

going to be great for deer and for steel

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.999 
going to be great for deer and for steel
to<00:02:04.209> promote<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.750> good<00:02:04.959> companies<00:02:05.380> that's<00:02:05.709> been

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
to promote to good companies that's been

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.529 
to promote to good companies that's been
around<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.489> years<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.119> think<00:02:07.360> we'll<00:02:07.509> be

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
around for years and I think we'll be

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.479 
around for years and I think we'll be
around<00:02:07.899> for<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> long<00:02:08.440> time<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:09.099> think<00:02:09.250> it'll

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
around for a long time so I think it'll

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.699 
around for a long time so I think it'll
be<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> great<00:02:10.060> merger<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:11.140> know<00:02:11.319> it'd<00:02:11.530> be

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
be a great merger you know it'd be

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.160 
be a great merger you know it'd be
probably<00:02:12.160> very<00:02:12.700> hard<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.390> john<00:02:13.599> deere<00:02:13.959> to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
probably very hard for john deere to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.729
