to one of most other silicones but more

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.700 
to one of most other silicones but more
than<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.920> has<00:01:45.190> super<00:01:45.760> low<00:01:46.060> viscosity

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
than that it has super low viscosity

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600 
than that it has super low viscosity
this<00:01:47.710> means<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.700> easy<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.390> mix<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:50.610> then

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
this means it is easy to mix and then

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.910 
this means it is easy to mix and then
finally<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.480> does<00:01:52.750> not<00:01:52.900> require<00:01:53.170> any<00:01:53.740> special

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
finally it does not require any special
