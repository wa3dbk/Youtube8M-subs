00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.660 

so<00:00:04.080> as<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.529> discussed<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.250> introduction

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
so as I discussed in the introduction

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.160 
so as I discussed in the introduction
we're<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.629> be<00:00:06.750> talking<00:00:06.990> about

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
we're now going to be talking about

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.410 
we're now going to be talking about
dermal<00:00:07.799> filler<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> it's<00:00:08.490> replacing<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
dermal filler and it's replacing the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.520 
dermal filler and it's replacing the
areas<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.110> lost<00:00:10.410> volume<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> face<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.530> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
areas of lost volume in the face so the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470 
areas of lost volume in the face so the
areas<00:00:13.920> we're<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.759> be<00:00:14.910> looking<00:00:15.299> at

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
areas we're going to be looking at

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950 
areas we're going to be looking at
treating<00:00:16.310> along<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.550> tear<00:00:17.880> trough<00:00:17.960> that's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
treating along the tear trough that's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
treating along the tear trough that's
this<00:00:19.230> little<00:00:19.470> line<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.160> tends<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.699> form<00:00:20.970> here

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this little line that tends to form here

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.970 
this little line that tends to form here
when<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.570> start<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:22.020> lose<00:00:22.170> volume<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
when we start to lose volume in this

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.620 
when we start to lose volume in this
area<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.359> cheek<00:00:24.720> area<00:00:25.550> actually

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
area in the cheek area actually

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
area in the cheek area actually
underneath<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.500> brow<00:00:28.800> bone<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.490> start<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> get

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
underneath the brow bone we start to get

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
underneath the brow bone we start to get
a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.300> bit<00:00:30.510> Hollow<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.890> tend

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
a little bit Hollow in there it can tend

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
a little bit Hollow in there it can tend
to<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> eye<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.420> sunken

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to make the eye look a little bit sunken

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.330 
to make the eye look a little bit sunken
and<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.320> tend<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.100> bit

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and it can tend to be a little bit

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.150 
and it can tend to be a little bit
ageing<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.989> treat<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> area<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
ageing so we can treat in that area and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.360 
ageing so we can treat in that area and
it<00:00:38.280> tends<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> give<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.059> youthful<00:00:39.300> look

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
it tends to give a more youthful look

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.119 
it tends to give a more youthful look
the<00:00:41.370> nasolabial<00:00:41.820> area<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.800> pop<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the nasolabial area and we can pop a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.670 
the nasolabial area and we can pop a
little<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.610> filler<00:00:44.789> down<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.680> along

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
little bit of filler down here along

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940 
little bit of filler down here along
this<00:00:46.890> line<00:00:47.270> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> also<00:00:48.600> treat<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> area

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this line we can also treat in the area

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
this line we can also treat in the area
of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.219> temples<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.120> another<00:00:51.510> area<00:00:51.809> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
of the temples that's another area that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
of the temples that's another area that
tends<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.710> hollow<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.000> age

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
tends to hollow out a little as we age

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.600 
tends to hollow out a little as we age
and<00:00:54.539> also<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> area<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> lower

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and also this area here in the lower

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.720 
and also this area here in the lower
cheeks<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.140> pop<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
cheeks we can pop a little bit in the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
cheeks we can pop a little bit in the
nasolabial<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.379> too

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
nasolabial so I don't like to do too

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
nasolabial so I don't like to do too
much<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> area<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.660> change

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
much in that area because it can change

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
much in that area because it can change
the<00:01:04.170> natural<00:01:04.409> contouring<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> particularly

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the natural contouring and particularly

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
the natural contouring and particularly
when<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.119> smile<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.960> there's<00:01:07.350> too<00:01:07.619> much

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
when you smile if there's too much

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
when you smile if there's too much
filler<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.460> area<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> little

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
filler in that area can look a little

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
filler in that area can look a little
bit<00:01:09.600> unusual<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.060> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
bit unusual so we go very light in that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.780 
bit unusual so we go very light in that
area<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> corner

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
area and a little bit here in the corner

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
area and a little bit here in the corner
of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> mouth<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> little

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of the mouth we're going to do a little

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
of the mouth we're going to do a little
bit<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> filler<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.570> lips<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> give<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
bit of filler in the lips just to give a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.100 
bit of filler in the lips just to give a
bit<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.650> volume<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:21.000> age<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> lips<00:01:21.840> also

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bit more volume as we age the lips also

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
bit more volume as we age the lips also
tend<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> lose<00:01:22.920> their<00:01:23.130> volume<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.670> tend<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
tend to lose their volume in tend to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
tend to lose their volume in tend to
fold<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.650> wanting

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
fold in a little bit we're not wanting

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
fold in a little bit we're not wanting
to<00:01:26.640> produce<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.720> large<00:01:28.020> lip<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.590> not

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to produce really large lip so it's not

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
to produce really large lip so it's not
going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> natural<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.090> Yvonne

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
going to be a natural look for Yvonne

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
going to be a natural look for Yvonne
but<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:30.990> wanting<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> replace<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but we're just wanting to replace a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
but we're just wanting to replace a
little<00:01:32.250> bit<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> volume<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.150> lost<00:01:33.450> if

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
little bit of the volume that's lost if

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.690 
little bit of the volume that's lost if
I'm<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> start<00:01:35.340> injecting

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
I'm actually going to start injecting

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'm actually going to start injecting
now<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> feel<00:01:38.299> unusual<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
now it's going to feel unusual it's you

can often feel like a pulling and a
tugging<00:01:42.450> feeling<00:01:43.159> every<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
tugging feeling every now and then you

tugging feeling every now and then you
get<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> sharp<00:01:45.630> twinge<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.710> very

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.420 
get like a sharp twinge but it's very
short<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> main<00:01:49.500> thing<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.100> try

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
short and the main thing is just to try

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.210 
short and the main thing is just to try
and<00:01:50.460> stay<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.630> relaxed<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.009> stay

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and stay really relaxed and just stay

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
and stay really relaxed and just stay
really<00:01:53.399> still<00:01:53.729> while<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.299> treating<00:01:54.750> some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
really still while I'm treating some

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
really still while I'm treating some
bits<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:55.770> feel<00:01:56.009> almost<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
bits will feel almost like it's kind of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.539 
bits will feel almost like it's kind of
along<00:01:57.509> their<00:01:57.750> bone<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.399> down

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
along their bone but I'm not going down

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.399 
along their bone but I'm not going down
to<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> bone<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.119> has<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.409> sensation

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to the bone it just has that sensation

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.190 
to the bone it just has that sensation
okay<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.759> too<00:02:03.000> uncomfortable<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.899> want

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
okay if it's too uncomfortable I want

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.450 
okay if it's too uncomfortable I want
you<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> hold<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.649> hand<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.040> say<00:02:05.189> stop

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you to hold your hand up and say stop

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:32.160 
you to hold your hand up and say stop
okay

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990 

so<00:02:32.740> now<00:02:32.860> we're<00:02:33.040> finished<00:02:33.340> with<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.610> dermal

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
so now we're finished with the dermal

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.570 
so now we're finished with the dermal
filler<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.600> we've<00:02:34.990> actually<00:02:35.830> placed<00:02:36.160> dermal

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
filler and we've actually placed dermal

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.110 
filler and we've actually placed dermal
filler<00:02:37.260> subtly<00:02:38.260> along<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.069> cheeks<00:02:39.430> tear

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
filler subtly along the cheeks tear

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.990 
filler subtly along the cheeks tear
troughs<00:02:40.480> underneath<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.590> cheeks<00:02:41.920> around<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
troughs underneath the cheeks around the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.680 
troughs underneath the cheeks around the
temple<00:02:43.480> area<00:02:43.780> under<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.830> eyes<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.690> little

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
temple area under the eyes a little

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.190 
temple area under the eyes a little
along<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:48.270> marionettes<00:02:49.270> area<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.020> even

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
along the marionettes area and even

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.440 
along the marionettes area and even
along<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.650> jaw<00:02:50.980> line<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.430> some<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.209> lips

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
along the jaw line and some in the lips

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.449 
along the jaw line and some in the lips
as<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.800> all<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.340> very<00:02:55.120> subtle

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
as you can see it's all a very subtle

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.830 
as you can see it's all a very subtle
positioning<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> filler<00:02:57.970> nothing<00:02:58.720> is

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
positioning of the filler nothing is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.020 
positioning of the filler nothing is
standing<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.530> as<00:02:59.680> too<00:02:59.890> dramatic<00:03:00.430> but<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:00.940> a

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
standing out as too dramatic but it's a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.260 
standing out as too dramatic but it's a
really<00:03:01.569> nice<00:03:01.780> overall<00:03:02.819> refreshing<00:03:03.819> look<00:03:04.000> as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
really nice overall refreshing look as

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.600 
really nice overall refreshing look as
you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.900> see<00:03:05.050> with<00:03:05.320> dermal<00:03:05.709> fillers<00:03:06.070> it's<00:03:06.400> an

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
you can see with dermal fillers it's an

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.670 
you can see with dermal fillers it's an
instant<00:03:07.120> result<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.660> actually<00:03:08.080> see<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
instant result you actually see the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.140 
instant result you actually see the
final<00:03:09.070> results<00:03:09.489> straight<00:03:09.670> away<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:09.910> it's

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
final results straight away so it's

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.990 
final results straight away so it's
incredibly<00:03:10.600> satisfying<00:03:11.430> over<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.519> next<00:03:12.730> few

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
incredibly satisfying over the next few

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.699 
incredibly satisfying over the next few
days<00:03:13.209> there<00:03:13.630> may<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.110> little<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.590> of

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
days there may be a little bit of

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.740 
days there may be a little bit of
swelling<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.370> dermal<00:03:16.000> fillers<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.300> actually

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
swelling the dermal fillers can actually

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.540 
swelling the dermal fillers can actually
absorb<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.290> little<00:03:17.410> bit<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.800> water<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.310> bit<00:03:18.459> of

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
absorb a little bit of water and bit of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.150 
absorb a little bit of water and bit of
fluid<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.300> can<00:03:19.630> have<00:03:19.930> some<00:03:20.260> areas<00:03:20.950> of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
fluid so you can have some areas of

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.940 
fluid so you can have some areas of
puffiness<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:22.180> lumpiness<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.560> will

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
puffiness and lumpiness but that will

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.940 
puffiness and lumpiness but that will
settle<00:03:24.459> down<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.150> actually<00:03:25.330> starts<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
settle down and it actually starts to

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.830 
settle down and it actually starts to
integrate<00:03:26.950> through<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.580> tissues<00:03:28.030> over<00:03:28.720> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
integrate through the tissues over the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.690 
integrate through the tissues over the
next<00:03:29.080> week<00:03:29.380> or<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.160> has<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.340> very

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
next week or so and it has a very

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.360 
next week or so and it has a very
natural<00:03:31.300> look<00:03:31.830> obviously<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:33.010> Yvonne's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
natural look obviously with Yvonne's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.949 
natural look obviously with Yvonne's
treatment<00:03:33.820> we've<00:03:34.030> treated<00:03:34.660> several

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
treatment we've treated several

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.750 
treatment we've treated several
different<00:03:35.530> areas<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.190> face<00:03:36.340> we've<00:03:36.579> done<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
full facial treatment used a fair amount

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.000 
full facial treatment used a fair amount
of<00:03:39.790> filler<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.570> we've<00:03:40.750> achieved<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.410> beautiful
