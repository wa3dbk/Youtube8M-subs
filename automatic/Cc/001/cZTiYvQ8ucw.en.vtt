00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
substitutes and should switch it up a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
substitutes and should switch it up a
bit<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.509> change<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> center

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
bit and then change around the center

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
bit and then change around the center
backs<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.950> generally<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.850> areas<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
backs and just generally for areas of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
backs and just generally for areas of
weakness<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.220> could

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
weakness or you know where i could

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.740 
weakness or you know where i could
improve<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> team<00:01:20.970> during<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> transfer

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
improve the team during the transfer

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
improve the team during the transfer
window<00:01:21.900> while<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> chance<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.040> then

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
window while I have the chance and then

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.969 
window while I have the chance and then
obviously<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.110> easier<00:01:25.140> from

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
obviously it will be much easier from

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
obviously it will be much easier from
when<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> league<00:01:26.580> starts<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:27.990> didn't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
when the league starts on so we didn't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.210 
when the league starts on so we didn't
notice<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> central<00:01:28.829> bank's<00:01:29.040> weren't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
notice that the central bank's weren't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.460 
notice that the central bank's weren't
great<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.420> did<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> couple<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.110> very

will<00:01:36.930> grow<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.439> overall<00:01:38.310> writing<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> then

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
will grow in overall writing and then

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.910 
will grow in overall writing and then
we'll<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.900> able<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> sell<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.770> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
we'll be able to sell them on for more

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
we'll be able to sell them on for more
or<00:01:41.159> keep<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.820> club<00:01:42.210> depending<00:01:42.659> on

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
or keep them at the club depending on

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
or keep them at the club depending on
what<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.079> planning<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.700> team

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
what we're planning to do with this team

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.840 
what we're planning to do with this team
at<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.100> ahead<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.520> search

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
at the time so I do go ahead and search

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
at the time so I do go ahead and search
for<00:01:47.880> centre-backs<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.960> been<00:01:49.140> max

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
for centre-backs that have been max

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
for centre-backs that have been max
estimated<00:01:50.040> worth<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.460> two<00:01:50.729> million<00:01:50.909> because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
estimated worth of two million because

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.240 
estimated worth of two million because
our<00:01:51.570> transfer<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.439> only<00:01:52.799> five<00:01:53.040> million

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
our transfer but it's only five million

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
our transfer but it's only five million
so<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> obviously<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.600> want<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> spend<00:01:55.049> too

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
so we obviously don't want to spend too

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
so we obviously don't want to spend too
much<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.159> anything<00:01:56.520> over<00:01:56.759> two

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
much and I think anything over two

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.700 
much and I think anything over two
million<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.469> bit

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
million will probably be a little bit

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
million will probably be a little bit
out<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> budget<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.820> then<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.630> won't<00:02:00.810> have

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
out of budget as then we won't have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
out of budget as then we won't have
money<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.560> improving<00:02:02.399> other<00:02:02.640> areas<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
money for improving other areas of the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
money for improving other areas of the
pitch<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.869> go<00:02:04.020> ahead<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.920> at

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
pitch so we do go ahead and look at

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
pitch so we do go ahead and look at
Michael<00:02:05.399> Capuano<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:06.240> Pesquera<00:02:06.689> i<00:02:06.780> believe

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
Michael Capuano from Pesquera i believe

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.120 
Michael Capuano from Pesquera i believe
is<00:02:07.259> bronze<00:02:07.590> last<00:02:07.860> year

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
is bronze last year

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.350 
is bronze last year
ultimate<00:02:08.430> team<00:02:08.550> i<00:02:08.640> did<00:02:08.790> use<00:02:08.940> them<00:02:09.120> in<00:02:09.240> one<00:02:09.330> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ultimate team i did use them in one of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690 
ultimate team i did use them in one of
my<00:02:09.480> jeans<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:10.230> his<00:02:10.770> estimate<00:02:11.400> values

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
my jeans I think his estimate values

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.970 
my jeans I think his estimate values
about<00:02:11.880> 2<00:02:12.120> million<00:02:12.330> bunch<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:13.410> his<00:02:13.530> position

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
about 2 million bunch with his position

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.730 
about 2 million bunch with his position
at<00:02:14.130> his<00:02:14.430> club<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.510> directors<00:02:16.080> estimated

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
at his club but my directors estimated

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.400 
at his club but my directors estimated
his<00:02:16.950> value<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.850> their<00:02:18.060> club<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.020> at<00:02:19.200> about

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
his value for their club to be at about

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.620 
his value for their club to be at about
2.5<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.130> 2.9<00:02:20.460> minutes<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.270> put<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
2.5 to 2.9 minutes I'm going to put in a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.190 
2.5 to 2.9 minutes I'm going to put in a
bit<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.930> 2.5<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.160> hopefully<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.330> him<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:25.110> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
bit of 2.5 and hopefully with him but we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
bit of 2.5 and hopefully with him but we
shall<00:02:25.350> see<00:02:25.410> how<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.860> turns<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.910> we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
shall see how that turns out so then we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.060 
shall see how that turns out so then we
go<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.540> transfer<00:02:27.960> lists<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.770> look

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
go into the transfer lists and just look

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
go into the transfer lists and just look
at<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> couple<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> older<00:02:29.670> players<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.510> do

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
at a couple of the older players and do

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
at a couple of the older players and do
go<00:02:31.380> ahead<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.860> set<00:02:32.580> our<00:02:32.610> oldest<00:02:33.030> goalkeeper

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
go ahead and set our oldest goalkeeper

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.470 
go ahead and set our oldest goalkeeper
up<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.780> sale<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.320> he's<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.610> past<00:02:36.270> it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
up for sale because he's kind of past it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.730 
up for sale because he's kind of past it
at<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.690> moment<00:02:36.780> unfortunate<00:02:37.410> cancel

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
at the moment unfortunate cancel

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.230 
at the moment unfortunate cancel
Scharner<00:02:38.130> because<00:02:38.430> he's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.940> recently

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
Scharner because he's just recently

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.760 
Scharner because he's just recently
joined<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.570> club<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.680> to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
joined the club and then I just have to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.740 
joined the club and then I just have to
look<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.000> expensive<00:02:42.240> players<00:02:42.600> or

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
look to so the more expensive players or

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.090 
look to so the more expensive players or
what<00:02:42.840> their<00:02:42.960> overalls<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.500> as<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.950> see

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
what their overalls are as you can see

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.470 
what their overalls are as you can see
we<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.280> van<00:02:44.580> der<00:02:44.700> Vaart<00:02:44.910> at<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> top<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
we have van der Vaart at the top and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.700 
we have van der Vaart at the top and
then<00:02:45.570> idler<00:02:46.020> believe<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.470> recently

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
then idler believe we recently

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.470 
then idler believe we recently
transferred<00:02:47.070> from<00:02:47.250> bayer<00:02:47.520> leverkusen<00:02:48.090> i

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
transferred from bayer leverkusen i

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
transferred from bayer leverkusen i
think<00:02:49.020> its<00:02:49.140> overall<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.710> downgraded<00:02:50.130> a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
think its overall and downgraded a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160 
think its overall and downgraded a
little<00:02:50.340> bit<00:02:50.430> from<00:02:50.580> last<00:02:50.610> year<00:02:51.030> i<00:02:51.060> believe<00:02:51.540> he

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
little bit from last year i believe he

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.220 
little bit from last year i believe he
was<00:02:52.320> 83<00:02:53.040> 84<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.210> ultimate<00:02:54.540> team<00:02:54.690> anyway<00:02:55.020> last

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
was 83 84 and ultimate team anyway last

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
was 83 84 and ultimate team anyway last
year<00:02:55.460> although<00:02:56.460> i'm<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.610> entirely<00:02:57.210> sure

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
year although i'm not entirely sure

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
year although i'm not entirely sure
don't<00:02:57.690> quote<00:02:57.840> me<00:02:57.990> on<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.250> get

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
don't quote me on that so then we get

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
don't quote me on that so then we get
our<00:02:59.550> objectives<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.270> season<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.900> what

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
hopefully get to tour finals in the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.400 
hopefully get to tour finals in the
domestic<00:03:07.770> Cup<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.000> guess<00:03:09.180> which<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.140> suppose

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
domestic Cup so I guess which I suppose

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.400 
domestic Cup so I guess which I suppose
is<00:03:10.470> called<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> dfb-pokal<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:12.240> or<00:03:12.480> polka<00:03:13.200> or

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
is called the dfb-pokal it or polka or

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.200 
is called the dfb-pokal it or polka or
however<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.950> pronounce<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.490> but<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.820> believe

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
however you pronounce it but I believe

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.940 
however you pronounce it but I believe
that's<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> name<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.110> German<00:03:16.800> domestic

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
that's the name of the German domestic

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.370 
that's the name of the German domestic
cup<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> something<00:03:18.660> interesting<00:03:19.080> there<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
cup and something interesting there you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
cup and something interesting there you
could<00:03:19.530> see<00:03:19.560> Ventus<00:03:20.520> are<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.940> after<00:03:21.150> neuer

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
could see Ventus are going after neuer

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.970 
could see Ventus are going after neuer
which<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.200> kind<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.410> interesting<00:03:22.470> since

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
which is kind of interesting since

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.860 
which is kind of interesting since
Avengers<00:03:23.310> already<00:03:23.550> have<00:03:23.700> both<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.150> probably

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
Avengers already have both on probably

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.420 
Avengers already have both on probably
one<00:03:24.960> of<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.110> top<00:03:25.260> three<00:03:25.530> goalkeepers<00:03:25.860> in<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
one of the top three goalkeepers in the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.360 
one of the top three goalkeepers in the
game<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.150> real<00:03:27.420> life<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.810> well<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.620> what<00:03:29.280> an

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
game and in real life as well so what an

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
game and in real life as well so what an
interesting<00:03:29.690> choice<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.990> make<00:03:31.110> their<00:03:31.410> I

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
interesting choice to make their I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.590 
interesting choice to make their I
suppose<00:03:31.920> fun<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.700> getting<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> little<00:03:33.480> bit

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
suppose fun is getting on a little bit

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
suppose fun is getting on a little bit
but<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.020> don't<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.590> he's<00:03:34.770> particularly<00:03:35.160> over

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
but I don't think he's particularly over

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.060 
but I don't think he's particularly over
the<00:03:35.670> moment<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.200> I'm<00:03:37.500> not<00:03:37.650> entirely<00:03:37.920> sure

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the moment and so I'm not entirely sure

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.410 
the moment and so I'm not entirely sure
why<00:03:38.430> they're<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:38.850> after<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:39.300> at

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
why they're going after know you're at

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.670 
why they're going after know you're at
this<00:03:39.450> point<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.990> time<00:03:40.020> Utley<00:03:40.350> could<00:03:40.470> probably

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
this point in time Utley could probably

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.280 
this point in time Utley could probably
he's<00:03:41.370> money<00:03:41.610> more<00:03:41.790> effectively<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.450> improve

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
he's money more effectively to improve

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.460 
he's money more effectively to improve
other<00:03:43.530> areas<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.100> their<00:03:44.670> team<00:03:45.360> but<00:03:45.870> as<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.320> saw

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
other areas of their team but as you saw

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.410 
other areas of their team but as you saw
there<00:03:46.500> are<00:03:47.340> bid<00:03:47.670> for<00:03:47.910> careful<00:03:48.060> when<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> was

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
there are bid for careful when I was

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.150 
there are bid for careful when I was
unfortunately<00:03:48.959> rejected<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:49.680> do<00:03:49.770> go<00:03:49.920> back

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
unfortunately rejected so we do go back

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
unfortunately rejected so we do go back
out<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.240> different<00:03:51.510> central<00:03:51.720> bank

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
out so for different central bank

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
out so for different central bank
because<00:03:52.050> we<00:03:52.140> weren't<00:03:52.350> willing<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.070> pay<00:03:53.250> that

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
because we weren't willing to pay that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.100 
because we weren't willing to pay that
three<00:03:53.790> million<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.300> they<00:03:54.390> wanted<00:03:54.720> us<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.959> pay

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
three million that they wanted us to pay

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.590 
three million that they wanted us to pay
that<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:55.920> probably<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:56.820> opinion<00:03:57.090> too<00:03:57.360> much

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
that is probably in my opinion too much

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050 
that is probably in my opinion too much
paper<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.770> guy<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.400> we're<00:03:59.640> gonna<00:03:59.730> go<00:03:59.910> out<00:03:59.940> and

paper that guy so we're gonna go out and

search for a little bit cheaper one he's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
going to be a little bit older we can't

unfortunately<00:04:03.630> bye-bye<00:04:04.260> otter<00:04:04.440> because<00:04:04.890> he

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
unfortunately bye-bye otter because he

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.970 
unfortunately bye-bye otter because he
is<00:04:05.400> actually<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:06.060> loan<00:04:06.330> at<00:04:06.570> 20<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.740> can't

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
is actually on loan at 20 and so can't

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.350 
is actually on loan at 20 and so can't
buy<00:04:08.100> him<00:04:08.190> at<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> moment<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:09.120> go<00:04:09.300> ahead

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
buy him at the moment but we do go ahead

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.320 
buy him at the moment but we do go ahead
and<00:04:09.660> put<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.709> bit<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:11.070> Bernardo<00:04:11.760> Espinosa

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
and put in a bit for Bernardo Espinosa

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.550 
and put in a bit for Bernardo Espinosa
and<00:04:12.600> since<00:04:13.440> he's<00:04:13.590> only<00:04:13.770> sporadic<00:04:14.100> for

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
and since he's only sporadic for

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.590 
and since he's only sporadic for
team<00:04:14.680> player<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.220> means<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.790> he's<00:04:16.419> more

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
team player it means that he's more

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.000 
team player it means that he's more
likely<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.900> sign<00:04:17.139> with<00:04:17.260> us<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.590> say<00:04:17.739> someone

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
likely to sign with us and say someone

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.800 
likely to sign with us and say someone
who<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.310> crucial<00:04:18.609> or<00:04:18.970> important<00:04:19.450> first<00:04:19.600> team

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
who is a crucial or important first team

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.409 
who is a crucial or important first team
player<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.440> we<00:04:20.829> do<00:04:21.040> submit<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.370> bit<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.700> 1.5

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
player so we do submit a bit of 1.5

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.870 
player so we do submit a bit of 1.5
million<00:04:22.990> euros<00:04:23.320> which<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:23.919> actually<00:04:24.190> 100,000

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
million euros which is actually 100,000

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.659 
million euros which is actually 100,000
under<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:25.660> his<00:04:25.900> estimated<00:04:26.440> value<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.639> I

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
under what his estimated value is but I

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.159 
under what his estimated value is but I
think<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.240> were<00:04:28.330> pretty<00:04:28.510> decent<00:04:28.840> chance<00:04:28.990> of

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
think we were pretty decent chance of

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.200 
think we were pretty decent chance of
that<00:04:29.320> deal<00:04:29.530> coming<00:04:29.800> through<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.120> can

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
that deal coming through and as you can

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.150 
that deal coming through and as you can
see<00:04:31.240> Benzema<00:04:31.930> is<00:04:32.500> actually<00:04:32.830> talking<00:04:33.010> to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
see Benzema is actually talking to

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.470 
see Benzema is actually talking to
Chelsea<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:33.820> i<00:04:33.850> believe<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.120> happens

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
Chelsea but i believe that happens

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.540 
Chelsea but i believe that happens
pretty<00:04:34.600> much<00:04:34.750> every<00:04:35.290> time<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.040> play<00:04:36.160> manager

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550

not<00:04:38.020> entirely<00:04:38.590> sure<00:04:38.770> why<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> suppose<00:04:39.700> Jesse

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
not entirely sure why I suppose Jesse

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.360 
not entirely sure why I suppose Jesse
could<00:04:40.870> kind<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.230> use<00:04:41.290> better<00:04:41.620> striker<00:04:41.980> but

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
could kind of use better striker but

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.830 
could kind of use better striker but
then<00:04:42.520> again<00:04:42.639> they<00:04:42.880> do<00:04:42.940> have<00:04:43.120> other<00:04:43.300> areas<00:04:43.810> of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
then again they do have other areas of

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.750 
then again they do have other areas of
their<00:04:44.410> team<00:04:44.710> which<00:04:44.919> could<00:04:45.190> be<00:04:45.310> improved<00:04:45.550> upon

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
their team which could be improved upon

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.510 
their team which could be improved upon

at<00:05:17.950> this<00:05:18.070> point<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.490> time<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:19.000> don't<00:05:19.060> believe<00:05:19.630> so

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
at this point in time I don't believe so

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.830 
at this point in time I don't believe so
after<00:05:20.380> that<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.740> do<00:05:20.800> decide<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.760> God<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:22.660> look

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
after that I do decide to God and look

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.110 
after that I do decide to God and look
for<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.050> scout<00:05:23.530> because<00:05:24.370> i<00:05:24.520> think<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.820> scouting

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
for a scout because i think the scouting

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.490 
for a scout because i think the scouting
system<00:05:25.270> is<00:05:25.539> still<00:05:25.960> pretty<00:05:26.080> good<00:05:26.260> in<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.440> game

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
system is still pretty good in this game

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.360 
be honest now but i do remember it was
relatively<00:05:31.120> effective<00:05:31.510> way<00:05:32.200> of<00:05:32.229> getting<00:05:33.130> good

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
relatively effective way of getting good

one I decided to tell him to go to
netherlands<00:06:36.290> I'm<00:06:36.410> not<00:06:36.530> sure<00:06:36.680> if<00:06:36.740> this<00:06:36.830> make<00:06:37.040> a

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
netherlands I'm not sure if this make a

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.830 
netherlands I'm not sure if this make a
difference<00:06:37.490> but<00:06:37.940> since<00:06:38.210> he<00:06:38.300> is<00:06:38.390> Dutch<00:06:38.660> I

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
difference but since he is Dutch I

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.720 
difference but since he is Dutch I
presumed<00:06:39.470> you<00:06:40.220> might<00:06:40.370> have<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.520> better<00:06:40.640> chance

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
presumed you might have a better chance

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.730 
presumed you might have a better chance
of<00:06:41.000> finding<00:06:41.150> good<00:06:41.420> players<00:06:41.660> in<00:06:41.930> his<00:06:42.050> homeland

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
of finding good players in his homeland

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.800

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
because I don't know I presume that is

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.630 
because I don't know I presume that is
the<00:06:45.080> way<00:06:45.200> it<00:06:45.230> works<00:06:45.620> i<00:06:45.890> would<00:06:46.040> hope<00:06:46.250> so<00:06:46.280> anyway

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
the way it works i would hope so anyway

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.670 
the way it works i would hope so anyway
so<00:06:47.240> he's<00:06:47.630> going<00:06:47.810> to<00:06:47.870> look<00:06:48.020> for<00:06:48.170> three<00:06:48.410> months

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
so he's going to look for three months

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.700 
so he's going to look for three months
