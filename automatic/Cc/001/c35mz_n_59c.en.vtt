00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
be for one pair of speakers for the left
and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.660> they're<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.620> gonna

and then they're right I think I'm gonna
miss<00:00:34.860> rows<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.940> little

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
miss rows if you want that's a little

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
miss rows if you want that's a little
easier<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> operate<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
easier to operate on and this is a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.119 
easier to operate on and this is a

single WP - some of these will come
packaged<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
packaged like this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.279

some of you package and zip locks just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
some of you package and zip locks just
depends<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.460> manufacturer<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> we

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
depends on what manufacturer that we

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
depends on what manufacturer that we
happen<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.930> pretty<00:00:49.170> generic<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
happen to get they're pretty generic so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.290 
happen to get they're pretty generic so
we<00:00:50.460> try<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> least

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we try to get them from the least

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
we try to get them from the least
expensive<00:00:51.780> source<00:00:52.160> anyway<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.219> I'll<00:00:53.399> show<00:00:53.550> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
expensive source anyway so I'll show you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.779 
expensive source anyway so I'll show you
how<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.910> things<00:00:53.969> work<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:55.489> pretty<00:00:56.489> simple

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
how these things work a pretty simple

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.330 
how these things work a pretty simple
device<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> front<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
device not much to them on the front and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
device not much to them on the front and
back<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.850> both<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> same<00:01:00.480> connectors<00:01:00.989> these

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
back then both the same connectors these

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.850 
back then both the same connectors these
things<00:01:01.920> screw<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.609> thumbs<00:01:02.850> group

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
things screw out with your thumbs group

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.170 
things screw out with your thumbs group
so<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:04.979> those<00:01:05.189> come<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.729> expose

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so as those come out they expose

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
so as those come out they expose
underneath<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.100> hole<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> wire<00:01:09.030> goes

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
underneath the hole that the wire goes

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.200 
underneath the hole that the wire goes
into<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> back<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
into this would be the back side of your

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.850 
into this would be the back side of your
wall<00:01:12.210> you'd<00:01:12.390> crimp<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> front

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
wall you'd crimp that down on the front

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.330 
wall you'd crimp that down on the front
side<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:14.490> either<00:01:15.590> bare<00:01:16.590> wire<00:01:16.799> put<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
side you can use either bare wire put it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.679 
side you can use either bare wire put it
in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
in the same way which is what we

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
in the same way which is what we
recommend<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> unless<00:01:19.350> you're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
recommend it unless you're going to be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
recommend it unless you're going to be
moving<00:01:19.950> around<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.909> use<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> banana

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
moving around or you can use a banana

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
moving around or you can use a banana
jack<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> those<00:01:22.920> would<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.610> there

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
jack and those would go right in there

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
jack and those would go right in there
into<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:23.970> middle<00:01:24.390> hole<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:24.720> there

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
into that middle hole right there

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.130 
into that middle hole right there
so<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.780> pair<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so this is for again one pair of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
so this is for again one pair of
speakers<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.799> left<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.170> if

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
speakers a left and a right and then if

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
speakers a left and a right and then if
you<00:01:31.350> need<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.909> row<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you need to do more of them in a row you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.480 
you need to do more of them in a row you
can<00:01:34.110> also<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:35.270> multiple<00:01:36.270> Decorah

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
can also use a multiple Decorah

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
can also use a multiple Decorah
installation<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> larger<00:01:39.659> J<00:01:39.810> box<00:01:40.079> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
installation and a larger J box you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
installation and a larger J box you
could<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> four<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.360> instance<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
could do up to four for instance and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
could do up to four for instance and
each<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> these<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.009> fit<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.549> these

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
each one of these would fit in these

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899 
each one of these would fit in these
individual<00:01:45.960> slots<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.399> four<00:01:47.670> across

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
individual slots you can put four across

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.899 
individual slots you can put four across
here<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.229> scenario<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> just

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
here in this scenario and then you just

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
here in this scenario and then you just
put<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> cover<00:01:51.360> plate<00:01:51.509> over<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> top<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
put a cover plate over the top this is a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
put a cover plate over the top this is a
dual<00:01:52.950> cover<00:01:53.220> plate<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.180> fit<00:01:54.420> nicely

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
dual cover plate but they fit nicely
