00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.940
 new video of me already has one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 nothing more is heard from me 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.500
 yes the video today a very sad 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.759
 occasion and that is my iphone 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 I do not like it down 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.500
 he knows he can see me up 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.810
 one that it is that the back of the bag 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.789
 but just broken and that's why 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.199
 I want to show how you like this 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 I can change backcover 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 I ordered a backcover here 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.240
 now the protective foil on it will 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.920
 I'll go off with you afterwards 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 there are quite a lot of differences 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.880
 you can get a lot of beckers 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.160
 order now I have so one in the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 middle price category taken at 25 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.989
 paid in euros 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.059
 that 's from six euros to 80 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 euro six euro I think if me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 Personally a little too little there 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.469
 I do not imagine that the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.520
 quality is right here and make it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.780
 impression also look at us later 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 more exactly what you put for it 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 actually only this little one 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
 screwdriver 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.410
 that is a pendulum if I do not know if 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.199
 I did not say that right 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.580
 the business trip bbl at anderson 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 I put you all the left 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.939
 the things love here has the one to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.530
 I need synonymous in the video 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.619
 descriptions rhine and the thing is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 actually quite simple 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.860
 those, however, and nina 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 iphone opened the night store that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.619
 still has video and you can 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.540
 this pack but not easy 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 push away the bad and done 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 though very much the ones below 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 two small screws here and here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 These screws are very very small 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.460
 You see I have some kind of too 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.049
 already lost because you have to be careful 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.890
 so that does not happen to you too 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.750
 could with these or whether that has front 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.259
 so it was not for me 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 normal screwdriver who at apple 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.960
 also surprising if they do it one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.280
 would do just that and with that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 screwed you just screw this out 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 no problem then as I said 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 very attentive to the steps 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.369
 small can be lost very easily 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.009
 happened to me and then it can be 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.219
 back cover easily up and away 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.219
 push 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.220
 and here also are now living inside 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.420
 from the iphone 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.830
 you can do that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.360
 can you, for example, the battery 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.250
 must be changed makes exactly 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 just cancel the dissecting accor 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.780
 would 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.790
 But we do not want to like the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.070
 respect but change there are new ones 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.480
 backcover and pushes as well as the last 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.610
 just pushed on it 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.920
 Press and then slide down 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.470
 it is a fit rode perfect as 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.210
 and then you can do yours 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.290
 screw in my case a screw 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.260
 in your case hopefully two screws 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:47.710
 can you get in the normal way 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:48.970
 screw it in and the backcover is already there 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.640
 Now let's change the subject 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:01.720
 but on me this protective film 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:04.060
 pull off so easy and open 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.360
 I have a very good impression with me 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.420
 klaas like it's original and feels 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.040
 a bit rougher than the original one 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.110
 but otherwise if you have that too now 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 Let's keep it that way next to each other 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.180
 There is hardly a difference here 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.290
 The camera also does a good job 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 impression you have to be careful sometimes 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.210
 I'm as gloomy as you say so 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.730
 change my backcover in my case 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.670
 at an iphone 4s goes to the iphone 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.900
 4 in exactly the same way just that 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.570
 she would need the two of them here 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.310
 backup does not fit together hold 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.950
 can not have an iphone 4 backcover on the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.500
 iphone 4s or the other way but make of 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.110
 principle how to get this out and about 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.610
 Power works exactly the same as me 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.900
 post the links where you are 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.920
 for example, in this commuter 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.480
 and of course where I can 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.670
 I bought the backcover and the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.570
 link to the cheaper Beck chamber then 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.160
 you can decide 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.830
 the cheaper short that the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 found course 9 eur 99 he should me 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.209
 sometimes dare to think because sometimes 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.890
 I did not break much 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.410
 I hope I could help it has weather 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.740
 you like it and see you for the next video 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.740
