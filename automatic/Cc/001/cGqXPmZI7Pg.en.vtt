00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
also he has decided not to use filler in

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.949 
also he has decided not to use filler in
the<00:03:44.280> back<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.610> his<00:03:44.640> guitar<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.780> just

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
the back of his guitar so that just

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.810 
the back of his guitar so that just
leads<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.560> bit<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> sinking<00:03:47.730> of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
leads to a little bit of a sinking of

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.069 
leads to a little bit of a sinking of
the<00:03:47.850> lacquer<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.239> he<00:03:48.450> really<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.959> look

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
the lacquer and he really like the look

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.910 
the lacquer and he really like the look
of<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.260> grain<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.769> mahogany<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.970> um<00:03:51.920> we

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
of that grain of the mahogany so um we

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.289 
of that grain of the mahogany so um we
were<00:03:53.040> able<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.489> for<00:03:53.760> him<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
were able to do that for him so it's a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.300 
were able to do that for him so it's a
little<00:03:54.420> rougher<00:03:54.810> looking<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.190> see

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

little rougher looking but you can see
some<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.730> grain<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.209> mahogany<00:03:57.480> he

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
some of that grain in the mahogany he

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.449 
some of that grain in the mahogany he

Junior<00:04:43.510> with<00:04:44.050> b<00:04:44.229> bender<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.979> we<00:04:45.639> worked<00:04:45.880> with

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
Junior with b bender so we worked with

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.830 
Junior with b bender so we worked with
Joe<00:04:46.720> Glaser<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.669> nashville<00:04:48.669> on<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.479> design

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
Joe Glaser in nashville on this design

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.689 
Joe Glaser in nashville on this design
so<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.199> is<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> factory-installed<00:04:50.889> b<00:04:51.460> bender

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
so this is a factory-installed b bender

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.850 
so this is a factory-installed b bender
it<00:04:52.120> can<00:04:52.270> actually<00:04:52.479> be<00:04:52.750> modified<00:04:53.350> very<00:04:53.620> easily

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
it can actually be modified very easily

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.240 
it can actually be modified very easily
to<00:04:54.130> be<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> G<00:04:54.520> bender<00:04:55.229> instead<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.770> kind<00:04:57.070> of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
to be a G bender instead so it kind of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.909 
to be a G bender instead so it kind of
handle<00:04:57.639> either<00:04:57.790> one<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.960> can<00:04:59.350> see<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.530> maple

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
handle either one you can see a maple

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.450 
handle either one you can see a maple
fingerboard<00:05:00.389> maple<00:05:01.389> neck<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.750> an<00:05:01.810> ash<00:05:01.990> body

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
fingerboard maple neck and an ash body

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.590 
fingerboard maple neck and an ash body
but<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:03.580> one<00:05:03.820> is<00:05:04.030> something<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.449> we're

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
but this one is something that we're

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.900 
but this one is something that we're
really<00:05:04.780> proud<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.560> we've<00:05:06.490> got<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.760> in<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
really proud of and we've got it in the
