of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.869> screen<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> touch<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.909> picks<00:01:27.630> up

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of the screen of one I touch it picks up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
of the screen of one I touch it picks up
where<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> left<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> other<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> touch<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.700> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
where it left in the other I touch so it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.569 
where it left in the other I touch so it
looks<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> massive<00:01:31.170> screen<00:01:31.579> when

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
looks as if it's a massive screen when

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
play with certain things and also if you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
play with certain things and also if you
shake<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.450> peeve<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.500> did<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.040> now<00:01:56.159> if

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
shake the peeve like I did just now if

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.999 
shake the peeve like I did just now if
you<00:01:56.520> shake<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:56.759> iPhone<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.829> transforms<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you shake your iPhone it transforms so

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
you shake your iPhone it transforms so
it<00:01:59.100> goes<00:01:59.219> from<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.600> newborn<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> baby<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it goes from like a newborn to baby to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.580 
it goes from like a newborn to baby to
child<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.579> whatnot<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.079> my

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
child and whatnot as you can see here my

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.240 
child and whatnot as you can see here my
transform<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> now<00:02:05.729> has<00:02:06.000> three<00:02:06.390> eyes<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> I

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
transform that now has three eyes so I

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.559 
transform that now has three eyes so I

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.589 
peeve to be grunting and panting that
much<00:03:17.769> because<00:03:18.010> they're<00:03:18.699> always<00:03:18.910> sitting<00:03:19.239> down

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
much because they're always sitting down

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.970 
much because they're always sitting down
like<00:03:19.840> if<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.079> see<00:03:20.290> right<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.500> they're<00:03:20.799> just

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980

like if you see right there they're just
sitting<00:03:21.250> down<00:03:21.930> there<00:03:22.959> noisy<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.919> annoying

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
sitting down there noisy and annoying

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.729 
sitting down there noisy and annoying
and<00:03:24.579> like<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.510> figured<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.260> game<00:03:26.440> was<00:03:26.590> for

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
and like I figured this game was for

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.500 
and like I figured this game was for
kids<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.400> shouldn't<00:03:27.639> give<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.000> bad<00:03:28.180> rap

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
kids so I shouldn't give it a bad rap

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.860 
kids so I shouldn't give it a bad rap
but<00:03:28.870> uh<00:03:29.940> honestly<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.419> think<00:03:31.510> if<00:03:31.750> you're

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
but uh honestly like I think if you're

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.680 
but uh honestly like I think if you're
paying<00:03:32.109> two<00:03:32.799> bucks<00:03:33.129> for<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.489> game<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.599> your

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
paying two bucks for this game for your

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.390 
paying two bucks for this game for your
kid<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.959> just<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.379> lock<00:03:35.650> themselves<00:03:35.889> in<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
kid to just like lock themselves in the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.629 
kid to just like lock themselves in the
room<00:03:36.639> and<00:03:36.970> feed<00:03:38.609> peeves<00:03:40.470> virtual<00:03:41.470> grubs<00:03:41.859> then

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
room and feed peeves virtual grubs then

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.089 
room and feed peeves virtual grubs then
like<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.599> need<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.750> reevaluate<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.590> 21st

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
like you you need to reevaluate the 21st

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.059 
like you you need to reevaluate the 21st
century<00:03:45.579> because<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.959> not<00:03:47.260> necessarily

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
century because it's not necessarily

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.099 
century because it's not necessarily
better<00:03:48.280> for<00:03:49.030> kids<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.750> know<00:03:49.840> like
