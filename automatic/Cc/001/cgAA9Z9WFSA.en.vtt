entire grain system will be powered by
solar<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.879> pretty<00:00:58.449> close<00:00:58.690> match<00:00:58.989> we<00:00:59.260> may

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
solar it's a pretty close match we may

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.630 
solar it's a pretty close match we may
have<00:00:59.500> little<00:00:59.800> bill<00:00:59.949> at<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> end<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.460> year

or a little credit on the electric so

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.079 
or a little credit on the electric so
what<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.590> will<00:01:02.770> enable<00:01:03.070> us<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.399> do<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.910> that

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
what this will enable us to do is that

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.580 
what this will enable us to do is that
the<00:01:04.270> way<00:01:04.420> I<00:01:04.449> view<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.869> is<00:01:05.049> we've<00:01:05.229> essentially

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the way I view it is we've essentially

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.219 
the way I view it is we've essentially
prepaid<00:01:06.220> our<00:01:07.000> electric<00:01:07.510> bill<00:01:07.689> for<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.020> next

prepaid our electric bill for the next

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.460 
prepaid our electric bill for the next
25<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.619> 30<00:01:09.010> years<00:01:09.369> Trey<00:01:10.180> has<00:01:10.420> relied<00:01:10.780> on<00:01:10.810> DuPont

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.160 
called tedlar is helping his solar
farming<00:01:24.490> as<00:01:24.610> well<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.810> was<00:01:25.869> reading<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
farming as well so I was reading the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.630 
farming as well so I was reading the
back<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.860> think<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.070> was<00:01:27.100> Solar<00:01:27.340> Pro

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
back of I think it was Solar Pro

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.859 
back of I think it was Solar Pro
somebody<00:01:27.970> given<00:01:28.240> me<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.479> there<00:01:28.570> was<00:01:28.659> an<00:01:28.750> ad

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
somebody given me and there was an ad

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.719 
somebody given me and there was an ad
from<00:01:29.080> DuPont<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.740> said<00:01:29.890> they<00:01:30.100> make<00:01:30.280> Ted<00:01:30.549> law

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
from DuPont that said they make Ted law

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.730 
from DuPont that said they make Ted law
and<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.030> didn't<00:01:31.930> know<00:01:32.020> what<00:01:32.170> Ted<00:01:32.350> law<00:01:32.470> was

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
and I didn't know what Ted law was

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.010 
and I didn't know what Ted law was
obviously<00:01:33.189> so<00:01:33.549> we<00:01:33.759> dad<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.780> lot<00:01:34.960> of

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
obviously so we dad and I do a lot of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.120 
obviously so we dad and I do a lot of
research<00:01:35.290> on<00:01:35.650> everything

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
research on everything

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580 
research on everything
many<00:01:36.939> would<00:01:37.119> claim<00:01:37.360> it's<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> fault<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.320> would

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
many would claim it's to a fault I would

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.260 
many would claim it's to a fault I would
probably<00:01:38.740> agree<00:01:39.009> with<00:01:39.340> them<00:01:39.490> we<00:01:39.790> tend<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.090> get

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
probably agree with them we tend to get

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.050 
probably agree with them we tend to get
involved<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.869> things<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:42.280> overboard<00:01:42.729> but<00:01:42.939> we

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
involved in things way overboard but we

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.700 
involved in things way overboard but we
want<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.299> be<00:01:43.390> educated<00:01:43.869> on<00:01:43.960> every<00:01:44.200> investment

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
want to be educated on every investment

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.789

it is the farming community that has

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
there but for the farming community I

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.140 
there but for the farming community I
think<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.440> can<00:03:20.620> see<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.280> not<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> one-time

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
think you can see this is not a one-time

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.300 
think you can see this is not a one-time
event<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.320> not<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> short<00:03:24.250> term

event this is not a short term

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.949 
event this is not a short term
commitment<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.660> an<00:03:25.780> ongoing

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959

celebrating that next step

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.510 
celebrating that next step
about<00:03:37.480> another<00:03:37.630> additional<00:03:38.470> commitment<00:03:39.100> to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
about another additional commitment to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.240 
about another additional commitment to
sustainability<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.720> agriculture<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.620> think

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
sustainability in agriculture I think

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.530 
sustainability in agriculture I think
that<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> sustainable<00:03:43.090> approach<00:03:43.360> to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
that the sustainable approach to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.940 
that the sustainable approach to
agriculture<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.350> going<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.709> imperative

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
agriculture is going to be imperative

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.800 
agriculture is going to be imperative
for<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> longevity<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.940> our<00:03:46.120> farm<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.600> think

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
for the longevity of our farm I think

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.550 
for the longevity of our farm I think
whether<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.170> working<00:03:47.440> with<00:03:47.500> the

whether it's working with the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.590 
whether it's working with the
environmental<00:03:48.160> community<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.910> help<00:03:49.330> clean
