actually but I took it that place
but<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> make<00:02:16.080> sticks<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.590> see

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
but so so you make sticks you can see

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.620 
but so so you make sticks you can see
but<00:02:17.099> if<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.370> place<00:02:17.640> three<00:02:17.880> over<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:18.120> see<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
but if you place three over here see you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.290 
but if you place three over here see you
won't<00:02:18.810> work<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.290> every<00:02:19.730> object<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.819> patent

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
won't work so every object is patent

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.510 
won't work so every object is patent
over<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.099> pattern<00:02:23.400> for

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
over here so this is the pattern for

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.970 
over here so this is the pattern for
sticks<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.390> once<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.440> touch

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
sticks so once you get that just touch

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.089 
sticks so once you get that just touch
drag<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.880> hold<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.330> mean<00:02:27.630> hold<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.380> drag<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
drag and hold I mean hold it and drag it

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.580 
drag and hold I mean hold it and drag it
over<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.239> sticks<00:02:30.540> that's<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.959> so

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
over here so you get sticks that's it so

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.559 
over here so you get sticks that's it so
yes<00:02:32.099> that's<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.489> case<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.269> how<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.450> make

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
yes that's the case this how you make

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.880
