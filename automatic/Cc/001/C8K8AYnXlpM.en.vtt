00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 only one subtitle of hdblog asus 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.519
 michael konyves 2014 with the zcs series of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 las vegas 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 a few months ago a few weeks ago and one 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 really very much product range 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.539
 interesting is this zen 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 phone 4 or 4 inches 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 wg therefore has 800 x 480 pixels with a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.960
 the oee really well made for everything 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.650
 a particular skin is very pretty is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.399
 easy to use very immediate and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.530
 readable for all options 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.800
 therefore important in part messaging 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 very well made telephone part 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 all the part of the notifications with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.989
 these icons are easy to click and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.050
 also a different quiz management 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.879
 compared to Android here with a kind of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.520
 notification schedule on what 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 happens and appointments or other messages 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 that we have inside the device 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.030
 we find an intel processor is the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.650
 model z 50 to 25 20 of 1.2 gigahertz 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 obviously a gigabyte of ram memory e 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.509
 4gb over cd rom with microsd ignition 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.970
 volume rocker off 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.350
 5 megapixel rear camera with 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 autofocus misses the flash here in the winter 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 speakers know here next to the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.880
 camera here the usb is a hole made a 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.840
 really much aesthetics and materials 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:42.000
 very nice metal finish very 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:45.330
 comfortable pocket and 4,000 04 you clean 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 this is 6 this is 5 here it is 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.570
 iphone 5 is always obviously intel core 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 therefore the possibility of having the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 processor, however, a little bit faster 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.520
 because we have a 2 c jazz with the fom 25 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.160
 80 in this case, however, the ram is always 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.680
 one gigabyte while the display is a 5 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.080
 inch hd costumization 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.400
 customization is practically similar 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.860
 with the hiv developed by asus a lot 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 very nice functional that the icons 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.700
 always the same positioning 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.050
 for switching on and off volume 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.720
 rear camera of this case the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.450
 cover is lightly rubberized with one 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.220
 very nice glossy finish 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.110
 now here in purple but it's really a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.390
 well-distinctive color here the flash 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 tour this micro usb side under with 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.940
 the microphone and above the jack for le 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.850
 TV headphones 25 mm camera of course 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.300
 classic front speaker we have 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.400
 the lancer which is divided into several sections 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.060
 they can then be customized throughout 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.610
 the zen phone product range therefore 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.660
 of asus is based on the android version 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.360
 2.3 and that can obviously be later 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.340
 updated in the future camera with 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.650
 all the asus settings we have 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.530
 also seen a part on james on fabs 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.140
 four with so many many options 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.200
 features scenes that can be 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.870
 operated and a room and that in this 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.310
 case is 8 megapixels plus 2 megapixels 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.510
 front to the cell phone 5 is here 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.150
 too many pockets alongside the 6 model 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.640
 inches that 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.519
 and obviously a little bit bigger like 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.530
 the size the oe the interface is always 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.000
 the same we always have a processor 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.000
 from 2GB on Saturday 25 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.909
 But here the display is that six inches hd 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.049
 ram and remains a jig always button 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.780
 switching off, however, positioned in the part 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.209
 lower than camera volume 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.629
 with flash the finish is like the cell 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.599
 phone 5 camera in this case from 13 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.930
 megapixel then a step up 2 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.549
 megapixel front-facing 3.5mm jacks 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.709
 microphone for the noise situation 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.799
 bottom microphone and usb 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.659
 here the grid for the soil 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.030
 the speaker and the usual keys 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.220
 fronts with the same oye that 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.190
 we have seen so far but I must say 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.500
 an oye that convinced me a lot for 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.650
 originality however and pleasantness with 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.840
 this gives all the interface to i 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.500
 zen phone we close let's say the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.789
 overview of the asus alongside the pad 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.910
 sewers that we have already shown you 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.539
 a small preview then a puzzle 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.849
 a tablet that can be turned into 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.789
 phone or better a phone instead 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.039
 and the oe can be transformed into a tablet 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.560
 also here resumes that of the zen 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:56.690
 phone and even here we have a processor 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.570
 intel atom 1.6 ghz with camera from 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.400
 8 megapixel camera at 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.530
 pixel master technology that allows 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.349
 capture images even in conditions 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.639
 of poor light of good discrete 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.710
 so even without the use of flash 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.770
 that in fact it is still possible to ad 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.310
 have good photo quality 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.690
 3.5 mm jack below the connector 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.990
 owner because it clearly goes 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.879
 engage in the legendary pad with station 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.819
 in this case the pathé was 7 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.970
 inch hd while phone and 14 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.370
 double thumb www.ge classic 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.930
 insertion and insertion engagement 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.030
 engagement that goes to activate the patmos 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.280
 passion in the moment that is battery 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.800
 in this sport station it is unloaded then 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.470
 the display does not activate a product e 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.770
 that therefore to all the dna of asus in the 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.479
 small pocket-sized pub phone one 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.099
 interesting solution will come soon 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.930
 in Italy the zen phones instead a 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.610
 a little later but still cheerful 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.659
 but they too not only so many of the three 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.659
