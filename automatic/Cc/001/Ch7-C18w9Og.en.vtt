00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
front reflector on the front fender the

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.020 
front reflector on the front fender the
bike<00:00:10.179> the<00:00:10.570> previous<00:00:10.840> guy<00:00:11.140> who<00:00:11.200> had<00:00:11.470> it<00:00:12.030> blocked

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
bike the previous guy who had it blocked

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.420 
bike the previous guy who had it blocked
stuff<00:00:13.390> out<00:00:13.660> like<00:00:13.690> you<00:00:14.410> know<00:00:14.530> painted<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.099> moon

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
stuff out like you know painted the moon

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.390 
stuff out like you know painted the moon
screen<00:00:15.790> black<00:00:16.029> and<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.830> paint<00:00:18.039> over<00:00:18.130> these

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
screen black and you paint over these

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.150 
screen black and you paint over these
and<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:20.380> you're<00:00:20.470> going<00:00:20.590> to<00:00:20.650> do<00:00:20.770> that<00:00:20.949> you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
and I think you're going to do that you

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
and I think you're going to do that you
might<00:00:21.310> as<00:00:21.369> well<00:00:21.490> just<00:00:21.630> remove<00:00:22.630> them<00:00:22.840> I<00:00:23.699> think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
might as well just remove them I think

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.529 
might as well just remove them I think
just<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.699> scrum<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:31.090> got<00:00:31.300> this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
just just on the scrum and you got this

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.210 
just just on the scrum and you got this
underneath<00:00:33.120> jet<00:00:34.120> doesn't<00:00:34.269> look<00:00:34.510> too<00:00:34.690> cool<00:00:35.220> but

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
underneath jet doesn't look too cool but

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.210 
underneath jet doesn't look too cool but
from<00:00:36.399> what<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.579> understand<00:00:38.010> underneath<00:00:39.010> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
from what I understand underneath the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.950 
from what I understand underneath the
back<00:00:39.430> seat<00:00:39.760> there's<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.059> couple<00:00:40.329> of<00:00:40.570> islands

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
back seat there's a couple of islands

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.040 
back seat there's a couple of islands
that<00:00:41.079> we<00:00:41.320> can<00:00:41.469> use<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.010> just<00:00:42.219> swap<00:00:42.899> swap<00:00:43.899> the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
that we can use and just swap swap the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.299 
that we can use and just swap swap the
bolts<00:00:44.350> outs<00:00:44.530> for<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:44.950> give<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.219> shot

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
bolts outs for you and give that a shot

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
click pop the back seat off and i'm

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.209 
click pop the back seat off and i'm
guessing<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.930> ones<00:00:49.930> i<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.260> use<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:51.010> can<00:00:51.100> see

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
guessing the ones i can use you can see

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
guessing the ones i can use you can see
there's<00:00:51.399> four<00:00:51.700> one<00:00:52.180> two<00:00:52.210> three<00:00:52.480> four<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:55.180> there

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
there's four one two three four up there

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.930 
there's four one two three four up there
and<00:00:56.620> try<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:56.860> pull<00:00:57.070> one<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.399> these<00:00:57.430> out<00:00:57.730> and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
and try to pull one of these out and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.549 
and try to pull one of these out and
seeing<00:00:58.120> if<00:00:58.239> it'll<00:00:58.420> work<00:00:58.539> on<00:00:59.340> that<00:01:00.340> front<00:01:01.559> front

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
seeing if it'll work on that front front

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.730 
seeing if it'll work on that front front
fender<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:04.329> there<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.780> replace<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.140> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
fender right there to replace that and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.830 
fender right there to replace that and
swap<00:01:06.100> them<00:01:06.280> out<00:01:06.430> Scout<00:01:06.880> what<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.240> i<00:01:07.299> swapped<00:01:07.600> it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
swap them out Scout what so i swapped it

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.929 
swap them out Scout what so i swapped it
out<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.560> here's<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.979> old<00:01:09.100> piece<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.759> does

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
out so here's the old piece and it does

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.590 
out so here's the old piece and it does
fit<00:01:10.179> in<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.420> they're<00:01:10.509> fine<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:12.179> which<00:01:13.179> it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
fit in and they're fine and which it's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.529 
fit in and they're fine and which it's
threaded<00:01:14.049> just<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.350> little<00:01:14.619> bit<00:01:14.770> longer<00:01:15.539> and

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
threaded just a little bit longer and

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.980 
threaded just a little bit longer and
see<00:01:17.609> underneath<00:01:18.609> it's<00:01:19.209> these<00:01:19.479> screws<00:01:19.869> that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
see underneath it's these screws that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.359 
see underneath it's these screws that
come<00:01:20.139> through<00:01:20.200> here<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.679> hold<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:20.920> license

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
come through here that hold the license

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.559 
come through here that hold the license
plate<00:01:21.520> holder<00:01:21.549> in<00:01:22.469> place<00:01:23.469> so<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.060> that's<00:01:25.420> like

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
plate holder in place so so that's like

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.859 
plate holder in place so so that's like
a<00:01:25.749> trick<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.319> a<00:01:26.349> perfect<00:01:27.279> swap<00:01:27.599> and<00:01:28.599> then<00:01:28.749> you

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
a trick in a perfect swap and then you

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.469 
a trick in a perfect swap and then you
can<00:01:28.990> see<00:01:29.109> for<00:01:29.319> comparison<00:01:30.029> this<00:01:31.029> is<00:01:31.209> what<00:01:31.389> it

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
can see for comparison this is what it

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.809 
can see for comparison this is what it
looks<00:01:31.659> like<00:01:31.869> with<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.829> blackout<00:01:33.249> reflector

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
looks like with the blackout reflector

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.620 
looks like with the blackout reflector
I'm<00:01:34.209> just<00:01:34.479> kind<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.259> pointless<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.630> then

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
I'm just kind of pointless and then

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.889 
I'm just kind of pointless and then
that's<00:01:38.049> what<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.319> looks<00:01:38.469> like<00:01:39.149> mmm<00:01:40.149> which<00:01:40.719> is

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
that's what it looks like mmm which is

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.409 
that's what it looks like mmm which is
the<00:01:41.139> Allen<00:01:41.859> in<00:01:41.979> there<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.819> so<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.209> I<00:01:43.240> only

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:43.419 
the Allen in there and so that I only

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:45.269 
the Allen in there and so that I only
pulled<00:01:43.659> from<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.929> backs<00:01:44.139> actually<00:01:44.619> actually

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:45.279 
pulled from the backs actually actually

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:47.010 
pulled from the backs actually actually
just<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:45.969> same<00:01:46.270> as<00:01:46.450> one<00:01:46.659> on<00:01:46.779> the<00:01:46.869> bottom

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just the same as one on the bottom

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.760 
just the same as one on the bottom
size-wise<00:01:48.929> so<00:01:49.929> yeah<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.229> think<00:01:50.349> it<00:01:50.560> looks<00:01:50.590> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
size-wise so yeah I think it looks a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.949 
size-wise so yeah I think it looks a
little<00:01:50.859> bit<00:01:51.009> cleaner<00:01:51.509> kind<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.599> silly<00:01:52.779> to<00:01:52.869> have

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
little bit cleaner kind of silly to have

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.620 
little bit cleaner kind of silly to have
a<00:01:53.079> blackout<00:01:53.499> reflector<00:01:53.979> there<00:01:54.329> only<00:01:55.329> takes

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
a blackout reflector there only takes

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.909 
a blackout reflector there only takes
about<00:01:55.689> five<00:01:56.049> minutes<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.380> do<00:01:56.499> this<00:01:56.649> pretty

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:56.919 
about five minutes to do this pretty

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:59.780 
about five minutes to do this pretty
easy

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.350 

you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
you

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.420 
you
