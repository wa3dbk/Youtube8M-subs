00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to you all trike it in this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 video we look at our new and 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760
 terrible enemy from fnaf 4 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 or maybe he is not new today will understand 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.990
 I can't wait to have a lot of ideas 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.670
 guesswork and so it went 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 do not forget to put tremendous fingers 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.279
 up under this video and subscribe to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 my channel 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 also join the VKontakte group there 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.170
 various contests are ssylochku 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.420
 leave in the description and so for convenience 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.820
 light the picture and increase the contrast and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 what a monster we see our body 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.290
 beloved springtrap head slaughter 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.760
 of course I am not sure about that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.180
 the legendary Sparky 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 hat so here who then stole and head 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 freddie by the way notice that they are pretty 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.570
 small or animatronic too 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 big although it's too early to tell who it is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.969
 pay attention to the fact that he has 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.579
 there is a bunch of island shit and a man's finger 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.789
 minigun or something like that and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.120
 notice this thing looks like a piece 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.579
 some kind of organ foo I suppose that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 the fourth part happens even later 3 and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.990
 during this time springtrap or rather 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.490
 the purple man is in it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.600
 I decided to fix the base myself for what 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 the possibility of a fierce fight with 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 puppet that we can see on 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.130
 the fifth sixth of the seventh night or for that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.960
 to kill the guard is difficult 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 say but it is clearly done to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.810
 kill also vian he is still visible 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.060
 mysterious us without nightmar in translation 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 meaning nightmare 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.540
 maybe it will be literally 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.909
 the nightmare of our guard a 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 maybe this animatronic will appear on 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.579
 the sixth night as a kind of boss after all 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 this is the last part of the game with which we 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.299
 principle will have to fight him 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.070
 defend myself I mean during 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.380
 close the ventilation door so on 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 the like was a logical thing to do with 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 good ending and bad and give us 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 only one chance to go through this mega hardcore 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750
 Well, you spent the night 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.600
 it means a good ending did not go bad 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.009
 one more detail is the wires in front of a 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.690
 maybe it's not wires 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.780
 inflamed vessels of the violet person 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.000
 who knows but for now we do not know how 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.790
 his name is mean let's call 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.280
 nipper well how do you write your version 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.330
 his name in the comments 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.330
 trike he chao cocoa
