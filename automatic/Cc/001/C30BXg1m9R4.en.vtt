00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.150
 I greet in touch Ruslan Gerande and 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.100
 In this video I will show another program in 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.630
 last video I showed the program 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.380
 Cabir expert in creating 3d covers in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.280
 this video i will show the bed program 3d 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.880
 cover 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.020
 This program I liked on order 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.360
 more than the past but she has her 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.790
 cons for example can not be here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.949
 twist the box differently to 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.280
 rotate differently we can choose 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.800
 only from ready-made templates but on the other 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.980
 The sides here are an order of magnitude more 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.899
 than in the last program 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.820
 about that is, for example, you can create 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.570
 here is such a box with such here 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.850
 effect on which of Kant as if 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.950
 she is open 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 there is also so what else is here to me 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.800
 liked what solutions yes i mean they 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.189
 different thickness we can choose the box 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.140
 thinner 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.439
 It is also an interesting solution but I still 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.939
 I liked such solutions as 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.430
 open box is also quite interesting 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:36.820
 and so let's have some 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.450
 choose here also more options with 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.630
 discs 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.479
 well if you like this program i 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.140
 I think you will find and download study 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:52.240
 all sorts of solutions here and I think 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:56.409
 that he will show it in bed 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.590
 video i will show some puns such 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.020
 interesting decision let's get past the video 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.969
 I did the usual 3d box in this I 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.570
 did this one with this one 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.750
 the effect of open images are loaded 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 Here in this block and tick marked those 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.600
 pictures to upload and so 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.510
 choose 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.910
 on the year front on this will be the downside 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.350
 we have such here it is the front side 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:35.190
 side of this picture 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 and up yes that is , we will have something 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 there is such an interesting one 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:46.940
 box here i will put a width of 200 on 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.940
 I will kill several birds with one stone and 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.910
 now we need to save 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 with this we can expand this box 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.490
 make her a mirror image she 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.700
 it would be like if we put it here 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.690
 tick transparent background opaque background 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.510
 I always like to do transparent 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.400
 then the box fits well with any 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.750
 design on a transparent background 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:22.130
 and when we all did this yes 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:28.280
 click save image click ok 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.280
 we select the folder we will create new 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:38.250
 and I will save here 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:43.560
 call her 1 and save all now 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:47.130
 open look yes our picture 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 the box has already been preserved and we 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:55.500
 we can remove this mirror effect 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.260
 reflections remove the tick here where 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.390
 show and all yes means with us 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.780
 reflection will not be here we can and 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.200
 also adjust the reflection the same 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.100
 with shadow we can shadow we can shadow 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.820
 put that is a very program 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.730
 simple very easy to use 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.280
 a huge selection of templates and me she 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.310
 I liked much more than the previous ones 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.760
 for the carpet expert on this i finish 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.260
 subscribe to my newsletter 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.050
 subscribe to my channel on u tube 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.900
 many interesting things are waiting for you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.290
 useful so see you in the following
