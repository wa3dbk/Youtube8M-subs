00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
tough you know defensively on a short

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
tough you know defensively on a short
clock<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:31.619> defensively<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.400> also

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
clock because defensively you're also

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
clock because defensively you're also
thinking<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> guy<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> shoot<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> ball

pretty<00:01:34.380> quickly<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:37.310> make<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
pretty quickly so you kind of make it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.760 
pretty quickly so you kind of make it
more<00:01:38.549> difficult<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> shade<00:01:39.479> them

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770
