battle and it was resurrected from the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.620 
battle and it was resurrected from the

how<00:02:37.340> much<00:02:37.580> difference<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> makes<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.600> terms

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
how much difference that makes in terms

of the the length of day depends on your

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.340 
of the the length of day depends on your
latitude<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.390> if<00:02:41.510> you're<00:02:41.660> at<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.840> reasonably

high<00:02:42.500> latitude<00:02:43.100> then<00:02:43.960> days<00:02:44.960> become<00:02:45.530> really

solstice tends to be a more critical

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.720 
solstice tends to be a more critical
time<00:02:51.110> because<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.530> course<00:02:51.710> that's<00:02:51.950> that's<00:02:52.460> the

time because of course that's that's the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.190 
time because of course that's that's the
time<00:02:52.940> when<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.270> day<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.450> getting<00:02:53.690> shorter<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
time when the day is getting shorter and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.890 
time when the day is getting shorter and
shorter<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.920> big<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.400> getting<00:02:55.700> colder

everything has died and you've had your

everything has died and you've had your
harvest<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> time<00:03:00.830> when

harvest and so on that is the time when
you<00:03:01.730> need<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.120> start<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.570> process<00:03:02.600> of

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
you need to start the process of

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.610 
you need to start the process of
regeneration<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.300> in<00:03:05.690> many<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:06.560> many
