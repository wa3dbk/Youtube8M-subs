tear<00:02:44.550> between<00:02:44.730> kangaskhan<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
tear between kangaskhan it's just it's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 
tear between kangaskhan it's just it's
so<00:02:46.260> high<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.830> plus<00:02:47.040> two<00:02:47.239> he<00:02:48.239> didn't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
so high at that plus two he didn't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.940 
so high at that plus two he didn't
really<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.870> anything<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> counter<00:02:49.799> it

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
really have anything here to counter it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.190 
really have anything here to counter it
now<00:02:50.519> scrappy<00:02:51.299> would<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.690> helped<00:02:51.900> against

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
now scrappy would have helped against

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
now scrappy would have helped against
that<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.860> Garchomp<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.299> know<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that so would Garchomp have you know a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.600 
that so would Garchomp have you know a
little<00:02:54.630> bit<00:02:54.810> he<00:02:55.799> didn't<00:02:56.010> bring<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.220> first<00:02:56.430> game

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
little bit he didn't bring a first game

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.250 
little bit he didn't bring a first game
and<00:02:56.880> that's<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.360> didn't<00:02:57.630> bring<00:02:57.720> kangaskhan<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and that's I didn't bring kangaskhan the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.589 
and that's I didn't bring kangaskhan the
first<00:02:58.470> game<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.799> same<00:02:59.069> fact<00:02:59.420> but<00:03:00.420> since

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
first game for that same fact but since

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.759 
first game for that same fact but since
he<00:03:00.690> didn't<00:03:00.840> bring<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> first<00:03:01.200> game<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.470> figured

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
he didn't bring the first game I figured

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.050 
he didn't bring the first game I figured
maybe<00:03:01.890> he<00:03:02.099> won't<00:03:02.190> bring<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.519> again<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> second

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
maybe he won't bring it again the second

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
maybe he won't bring it again the second
game<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.360> he<00:03:03.480> doesn't<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.049> this<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.590> allows

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
game and he doesn't and this this allows

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
game and he doesn't and this this allows
Kangas<00:03:05.160> time<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.549> run<00:03:06.330> through<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
Kangas time to just run through the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.809 
Kangas time to just run through the
whole<00:03:06.930> team<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.220> first<00:03:08.459> game<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.640> was

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
whole team in the first game I was

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.520
