00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
is you just gently scraping it you can

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.940 
is you just gently scraping it you can
look<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:10.570> really<00:02:10.780> hard<00:02:11.050> sometimes<00:02:11.380> but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
look like it's really hard sometimes but

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.500 
look like it's really hard sometimes but
we<00:02:12.580> don't<00:02:12.760> want<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> press<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.360> hard

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
we don't want to press really hard

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.770 
we don't want to press really hard
actually<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.770> we're<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.610> scraping<00:02:16.030> off<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
actually and we're just scraping off the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.070 
actually and we're just scraping off the
organic<00:02:17.620> skin<00:02:18.580> around<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.420> cuticle<00:02:19.870> that's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
organic skin around the cuticle that's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.590 
organic skin around the cuticle that's
kind<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.380> stuck<00:02:20.890> there<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.180> where

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
kind of stuck there that is not where

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.900 
kind of stuck there that is not where
polish<00:02:22.959> wants<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.320> stick<00:02:23.560> polish<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.280> any

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
polish wants to stick polish or any

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.600 
polish wants to stick polish or any
primer<00:02:25.330> or<00:02:26.049> acrylic<00:02:26.620> or<00:02:26.739> anything<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.340> on

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
primer or acrylic or anything going on

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.759 
primer or acrylic or anything going on
there<00:02:27.880> will<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:28.690> stick<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.230> there's<00:02:29.590> any

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
there will not stick to that there's any

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.050 
there will not stick to that there's any
lifting<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> could<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.940> your

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
lifting that could be one of your

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.449 
lifting that could be one of your
reasons<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.590> we're<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.220> gently

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
reasons so we're just going to gently

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.289 
reasons so we're just going to gently
take<00:02:34.000> off<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:35.220> stuff<00:02:38.549> okay<00:02:39.549> we're

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
take off that little stuff okay we're

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.780 
take off that little stuff okay we're
going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> prep<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.900> nail<00:02:41.320> by<00:02:42.220> buffing<00:02:42.640> with<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
going to prep the nail by buffing with a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.600 
going to prep the nail by buffing with a
file<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.720> higher<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.320> number<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.890> finer

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
file so the higher the number the finer

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.310 
file so the higher the number the finer
the<00:02:45.880> buff<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.269> don't<00:02:46.540> want<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> put<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.049> fine

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
the buff we don't want to put a fine

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.500 
the buff we don't want to put a fine
buff<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.160> when<00:02:48.310> we're<00:02:48.459> applying<00:02:48.730> acrylic

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
buff on here when we're applying acrylic

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
buff on here when we're applying acrylic
nails<00:02:49.720> or<00:02:49.959> gel<00:02:50.260> nails<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.680> top<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:50.950> here<00:02:51.070> or

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
nails or gel nails on top of here or

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.550 
nails or gel nails on top of here or
even<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.730> gel<00:02:51.940> polish<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.840> reason<00:02:53.140> being<00:02:53.320> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
even the gel polish the reason being is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.280 
even the gel polish the reason being is
because<00:02:54.340> if<00:02:54.579> we<00:02:54.700> do<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.209> smooth<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
because if we do it to smooth the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.229 
because if we do it to smooth the
product<00:02:56.650> won't<00:02:56.739> stick<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:57.730> do<00:02:57.850> want<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.120> get

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
product won't stick so we do want to get

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.720 
product won't stick so we do want to get
a<00:02:58.269> bit<00:02:58.540> more<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.110> grit<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.799> it<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.070> like<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.549> use

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
a bit more of a grit to it I like to use

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.380 
a bit more of a grit to it I like to use
the<00:03:00.880> 180<00:03:01.329> which<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.739> medium<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> bit<00:03:04.180> more

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
the 180 which is a medium to a bit more

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.250 
the 180 which is a medium to a bit more
of<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.600> grittier<00:03:04.989> file<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.630> like<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.019> files

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
of a grittier file so I like the files

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.569 
of a grittier file so I like the files
these<00:03:08.650> ones<00:03:08.890> which<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.130> couldn't<00:03:09.310> because<00:03:09.489> it

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
these ones which I couldn't because it

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.910 
these ones which I couldn't because it
quit<00:03:09.730> soft<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.780> can<00:03:10.930> really<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.590> into<00:03:11.829> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
quit soft you can really get it into the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.819 
quit soft you can really get it into the
corner<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.340> her<00:03:12.489> nails<00:03:13.200> or<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> round<00:03:14.530> moves

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
corner of her nails or the round moves

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.789 
corner of her nails or the round moves
there's<00:03:15.220> really<00:03:15.370> no<00:03:15.579> corners<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.120> suppose<00:03:16.799> so

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
there's really no corners I suppose so

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.140 
there's really no corners I suppose so
when<00:03:17.950> you're<00:03:18.070> doing<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.459> you're<00:03:18.670> taking<00:03:19.060> off

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
when you're doing this you're taking off

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.520 
when you're doing this you're taking off
while<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.540> oil<00:03:19.570> you're<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.049> going<00:03:20.290> deep

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
while the oil you're not going deep

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.980 
while the oil you're not going deep
there's<00:03:20.769> lots<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.070> layers<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.370> show

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
there's lots of layers that show

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.260 
there's lots of layers that show
so<00:03:22.440> you're<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:23.010> gently<00:03:23.370> buffing<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
so you're just really gently buffing the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.990 
so you're just really gently buffing the
surface<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.960> natural<00:03:25.380> mail<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.550> prep<00:03:26.820> it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
surface of the natural mail to prep it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.390 
surface of the natural mail to prep it
before<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.840> put<00:03:28.050> whatever<00:03:28.530> product<00:03:29.280> you're

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
before you put whatever product you're

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.140 
before you put whatever product you're
putting<00:03:29.760> on<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> want<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.580> get<00:03:35.700> all<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
putting on it so you want to get all the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.360 
putting on it so you want to get all the
little<00:03:36.330> corners<00:03:36.870> get<00:03:37.320> all<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> way<00:03:37.650> around<00:03:38.010> if

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
little corners get all the way around if

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.180 
little corners get all the way around if
you<00:03:38.760> leave<00:03:39.240> any<00:03:39.510> little<00:03:39.960> shiny<00:03:40.200> area<00:03:40.710> that

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
you leave any little shiny area that

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.370 
you leave any little shiny area that
also<00:03:41.790> could<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.120> reason<00:03:42.450> why<00:03:42.600> any<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.320> of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
also could be a reason why any one of

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.210 
also could be a reason why any one of
your<00:03:43.590> products<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.980> lifting<00:03:44.370> okay<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.800> can<00:03:50.040> do

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
your products is lifting okay you can do

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.830 
your products is lifting okay you can do
this<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.610> drill<00:03:50.940> as<00:03:51.060> well<00:03:51.240> I<00:03:51.270> would<00:03:51.480> use<00:03:51.720> an
