and depressed these foods have been

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.200 
and depressed these foods have been
engineered<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:45.159> very<00:01:45.490> clever<00:01:45.939> ways

scientists actually overlay these foods

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.690 
scientists actually overlay these foods
with<00:01:49.329> precise<00:01:49.869> layers<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.159> types<00:01:51.460> of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
things like salt fat and sugar that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.679 
things like salt fat and sugar that
literally<00:01:54.070> light<00:01:54.999> up<00:01:55.149> our<00:01:55.299> brain<00:01:55.479> chemistry

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
literally light up our brain chemistry

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.169 
literally light up our brain chemistry
and<00:01:56.140> get<00:01:56.320> our<00:01:56.409> dopamine<00:01:56.979> neurons<00:01:57.280> firing<00:01:57.729> so

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
and get our dopamine neurons firing so

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.999 
and get our dopamine neurons firing so
that<00:01:58.329> we<00:01:58.450> feel<00:01:58.630> craving<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.469> feel<00:01:59.679> we<00:01:59.829> have

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
that we feel craving and we feel we have

only<00:02:02.530> goes<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:02.829> far<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.369> low<00:02:03.789> power<00:02:04.030> is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
only goes so far with that low power is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.539 
only goes so far with that low power is
kind<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.689> it'll<00:02:04.929> get<00:02:05.109> you<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.499> far<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:06.369> it's

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
kind of it'll get you so far but it's

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.190 
kind of it'll get you so far but it's
kind<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:06.819> like<00:02:06.999> holding<00:02:07.390> onto<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.719> ledge<00:02:07.960> with

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
kind of like holding onto a ledge with

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.719 
kind of like holding onto a ledge with
your<00:02:08.350> fingernails<00:02:08.770> eventually<00:02:09.460> you're<00:02:09.610> going

why<00:02:13.160> these<00:02:13.220> foods<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.270> kind<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.720> hold

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
why these foods have the kind of hold

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.080 
why these foods have the kind of hold
they<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.230> over<00:02:15.950> us<00:02:15.980> why<00:02:16.400> when<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.670> walk<00:02:16.910> into

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
they have over us why when you walk into

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.000 
they have over us why when you walk into
a<00:02:17.209> food<00:02:17.480> court<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.170> smell<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> Cinnabon

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
a food court and you smell a Cinnabon

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.640 
a food court and you smell a Cinnabon
you<00:02:19.459> must<00:02:19.880> have<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> cannot<00:02:20.930> say<00:02:21.170> no<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
you must have it you cannot say no to it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.559 
you must have it you cannot say no to it
or<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.310> very<00:02:22.520> hard<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> say<00:02:23.030> no<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.240> it

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
or it's very hard to say no to it

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.270 
or it's very hard to say no to it
and<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.959> work<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.500> those<00:02:24.800> kinds<00:02:25.220> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
and we work on those kinds of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.860 
and we work on those kinds of
associations<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.660> food<00:02:26.840> that

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
associations that we have to food that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.110 
associations that we have to food that
make<00:02:27.290> them<00:02:27.530> addictive<00:02:28.040> we<00:02:28.370> try<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> break<00:02:28.880> that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
make them addictive we try to break that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.809 
make them addictive we try to break that
down<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.660> actually<00:02:30.170> reprogram<00:02:30.620> our<00:02:30.980> brain<00:02:31.250> so

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
down and actually reprogram our brain so

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.880 
down and actually reprogram our brain so
that<00:02:32.030> we<00:02:32.330> are<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.989> victim<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.620> these

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that we are not the victim of these

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.130 
that we are not the victim of these
cravings<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.489> instead<00:02:34.850> have<00:02:35.390> some<00:02:35.690> mastery

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
cravings but instead have some mastery

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.880 
cravings but instead have some mastery
over<00:02:36.620> them<00:02:37.360> well<00:02:38.360> everybody<00:02:39.200> has<00:02:39.530> different

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
over them well everybody has different

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.640 
over them well everybody has different
trigger<00:02:40.340> foods<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.420> rather<00:02:41.989> than<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.470> give<00:02:42.620> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
trigger foods so rather than just give a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.990 
trigger foods so rather than just give a
list<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.100> these<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.550> food<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.819> should

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
list of these are the food you should

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.410 
list of these are the food you should
never<00:02:44.120> eat<00:02:44.270> which<00:02:44.480> would<00:02:44.630> by<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> way<00:02:44.989> we<00:02:45.110> do

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
never eat which would by the way we do

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.690 
never eat which would by the way we do
but<00:02:47.420> for<00:02:47.630> most<00:02:47.810> people<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.340> certain

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
but for most people there are certain

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520 
but for most people there are certain
foods<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.209> are<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.720> their<00:02:50.930> trigger<00:02:51.230> foods

you<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:52.160> can't<00:02:52.400> say<00:02:52.580> no<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.820> these<00:02:53.030> these<00:02:53.239> are

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
you just can't say no to these these are

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
you just can't say no to these these are
the<00:02:53.510> ones<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.810> are<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.170> going<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> derail

the ones that are just going to derail

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.820 
the ones that are just going to derail
you<00:02:55.640> no<00:02:55.790> matter<00:02:55.970> what<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:57.019> we<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> lot<00:02:57.769> of

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
you no matter what so we do a lot of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.740 
you no matter what so we do a lot of
individual<00:02:58.519> working<00:02:58.730> unleashes<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.600> where

individual working unleashes and where
people<00:03:00.080> actually<00:03:00.230> identify<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:00.950> those

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
people actually identify what those

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
they can't say them to we talk a lot

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.570 
they can't say them to we talk a lot
about<00:03:05.300> things<00:03:05.750> like<00:03:05.810> we<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.980> grains<00:03:07.280> which

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
about things like we and in grains which

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.220 
about things like we and in grains which
are<00:03:07.730> bad<00:03:08.060> for<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> lot<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.569> people<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.050> not<00:03:09.170> for

through<00:03:19.130> journaling<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.299> through<00:03:20.570> keeping

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
through journaling and through keeping

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.960 
through journaling and through keeping
notes<00:03:21.530> on<00:03:21.829> how<00:03:22.100> they<00:03:22.310> are<00:03:22.370> affected<00:03:22.850> by

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
notes on how they are affected by

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.539 
notes on how they are affected by
different<00:03:23.150> foods<00:03:23.620> discover<00:03:24.620> which<00:03:25.010> foods<00:03:25.340> are

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
different foods discover which foods are

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.340 
different foods discover which foods are
really<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> ones<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.329> are<00:03:26.570> derailing<00:03:26.959> their

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
really the ones that are derailing their

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.140 
really the ones that are derailing their
whole<00:03:27.530> program<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.070> then<00:03:28.700> they<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:29.030> take

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
whole program and then they can take

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.000 
whole program and then they can take
those<00:03:29.390> foods<00:03:29.720> out<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.410> those<00:03:30.620> foods

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
those foods out and if those foods

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.069 
those foods out and if those foods
really<00:03:31.220> are<00:03:31.489> not<00:03:31.760> problems<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.390> them<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:32.930> we

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
really are not problems for them then we

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.560 
really are not problems for them then we
we<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> template<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.880> infrastructure

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
we have a template and infrastructure

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.539 
we have a template and infrastructure
that<00:03:35.690> figures<00:03:36.079> out<00:03:36.260> how<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.250> add<00:03:37.400> those

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
that figures out how you can add those

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.060 
that figures out how you can add those
back<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.269> what<00:03:38.480> amounts<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.620> you're<00:03:39.769> very

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
back and in what amounts so you're very

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.370 
back and in what amounts so you're very
very<00:03:40.340> carefully<00:03:40.940> actually<00:03:41.450> doing<00:03:42.049> kind<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.290> a

certainly not wise which is that weight

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.060 
certainly not wise which is that weight
loss<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.810> simply<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.079> matter<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.380> calories<00:04:06.890> and
