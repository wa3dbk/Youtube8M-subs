00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello friends in the most drinking-air 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.300
 among the glass and the most glass 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.590
 among the drinking headings of the Galileo programs 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.449
 which is called look i have 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 if the so-called rubric experiments 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.050
 but see what I have here, that's why 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 now doing this crap 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 Petrosyan is not here playing a type 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.470
 drunk we program galileo and heading 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.940
 experiments in particular against 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 drinking alcohol inside 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 need to drink alcohol outside then 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 eat to use it in experiments 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.600
 friends our next experiment is very 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.870
 simple for this you will need 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 90-year-old brandy many have it at home 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 neatly poured it in ryumashku 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.010
 like that right for the most do not want to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 now we take a small hill 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 another glass with cognac too 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 we do not need it and pour it there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.060
 ordinary water water 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 ordinary we pour in another Ryumashka 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 also with a slide now see friends 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 cut out quickly cooked noodles 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.159
 and here is such a small piece 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.180
 plastic 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.259
 neatly put it on a glass of water and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.820
 turn over but it's own 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.080
 experiment we have shown you yet 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.320
 a hundred years ago nothing surprising in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 this is not disgusting we put this glass as well 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 neck to neck on a glass with cognac 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 and gently shifting this from plastic 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.409
 plate 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.250
 do a little crack between these 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.439
 two vessels you see yes small 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 trickle 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:52.170
 brandy ran up to say we 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.219
 experimenters but why because 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.180
 cognac in this case it is a fraction of light 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.659
 but the water fraction is heavy as it is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.630
 heavy then she slowly flows down here in 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.319
 bottom glass with cognac and naturally 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.420
 It squeezes out the light fraction cognac 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.890
 which a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.830
 at warrior stenochku distributed in 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.110
 a glass on top and as you see with us 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.810
 the process is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.250
 Brandy neatly occupies the top 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.239
 top cup 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.170
 and the water gently occupies the bottom 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.580
 bottom glass is simply due 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.060
 density differences 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.060
 they change places after some 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.739
 while the bottom will only clean water and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.000
 on top will be pure brandy while they 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.370
 hardly mixed due to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.489
 the fact that the process is very like to say well 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 laminar that is gradual in given 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.150
 case this experiment is us 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.670
 shows a density difference of 2000 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.610
 to be even clearer and see for yourself 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.620
 take an ordinary glass 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.410
 but a little more pour oil into it 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.350
 which in the first place is lighter than water 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:23.510
 secondly b does not mix with water 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:26.870
 Just pour a full glass here in 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.750
 the second glass according to the tradition we pour 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.660
 that something that denser oil in this case 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.959
 ordinary water using the same 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.609
 so little white stuff 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.900
 I'm sorry I'll take this one 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.250
 dad broke a bit all is not scary 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.859
 let's do the first trick that you 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.739
 showed how long ago in one of 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.650
 Our first programs have this 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.170
 water over a glass with butter and also 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.060
 open a small hole do 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.069
 between the oil and the water the water begins 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.459
 go down the oil starts 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.720
 to go up 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:10.340
 thin-thin stream well come on 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.180
 come on up here that's beautiful and everything 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.669
 understandable oil as a light fraction 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.769
 rises up and the water is heavy 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.330
 goes down 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.010
 own in this way 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.020
 believe oil from tanks 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.510
 come up your cans say here u 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.910
 me canister full of water that i can 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.240
 steal into the canister which is already filled 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.460
 by water 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.890
 neatly place the canister on top of 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.770
 an oil tank like this 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.340
 connect them your water flows into 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.130
 tank car 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.050
 oil from the tank is carefully filled 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.320
 your canister is what it is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.050
 useful part of our experiment on 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.040
 that's all for now 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.040
 oh cold frost
