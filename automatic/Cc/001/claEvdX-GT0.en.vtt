00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 for me it's like this trend the 33 and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.150
 today I'm about to make a video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.910
 tutorial on how to put soul sound 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.490
 because I 've realized that if you guys 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 see other videos means they go 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 to the access folder and in that folder 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.170
 access will be the folder are and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.810
 sounds 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.420
 and the 2 folders are not going to have the same 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.650
 the same files so they have to 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.439
 pass the files in the folder do not 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.649
 according to the other folder 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.489
 good and to the folder that have less 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.610
 then leave her open files go 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.430
 to pass the folder that has the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.899
 folder south sound that I do not know which is the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.159
 that have the files will happen to 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.070
 the other folder that have less 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.100
 sound files are that if we're going to 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.120
 put are have fewer files that are 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.299
 those an example are not going to be like that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.390
 an example let's put are have 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:07.990
 fewer files that are then you 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.319
 They will pass told them that you 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.569
 they were going to pass the files in the folder 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:17.659
 are the shows folder that they have 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:21.380
 fewer files where you are going to give 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.030
 but for good with yourself you can 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.670
 take out the sets folder 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 Well, mother, I'm going to take you out 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 they have to do I do not stop those who 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 I explained why the modifications and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.770
 then I put and put it so that it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.679
 download way and good 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 well I'm going to take out the folder sets and 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.579
 I'm going to open a minecraft 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.109
 I'm off line 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.890
 this is going to take a bit because I 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.810
 I have this logo that is not the logo of the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.049
 minecraft but it looks like a table 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.770
 I cut and how are you going to see I will not have 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.840
 no sound here will take time to take 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.030
 because I have a texture package that 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.030
 it's the heaviest a bit fast 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.810
 but that is explaining the grave the ies 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.200
 falls the sky work continues and is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 end kuiper vigil 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.670
 but it has nothing then I will enter 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.349
 as for skype what I'm doing is not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.060
 is from the series a sky map what 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.410
 is doing 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.700
 how can mothers see 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.410
 this is madrid i do not have sound wey no 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.770
 There are a thousand beaks and I have no sound 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.760
 good 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:58.440
 nothing does not sound good now what 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.060
 what you are going to do is download 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.330
 the folder that I leave in the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.380
 description how to basically do this 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.940
 Folder 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.780
 do not do not put this in your brand and it will no longer be 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.220
 in the folder h 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.560
 thank you for here because if not I would not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.600
 let's make the file good I have a 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.170
 once I'm the file as it is called 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.270
 but I want you to be heard low because 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.600
 I'm moving a little away from the microphone 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.700
 good 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.080
 it appears in this file very much the same as 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 it's access to open it's a bit shabby 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.720
 good life inside the access folder 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.930
 is going to open 2002 inside power 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 another folder that happens here is 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.120
 folder is the one that is worth the other 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.530
 then it 's processing is going to take a 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.910
 just because it has many sounds the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 animals and that of animal sounds 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.560
 of the grass as path of the portal all 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.070
 that then it 's a bit in going over to the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.990
 folder but do not worry about those that 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:11.520
 not all a little they do not see 2 543 this is not 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:16.100
 by the speed of his power or not 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.690
 and this is the one that is worth this folder 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.570
 in here you are going to pass I go to 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:30.520
 remove this I'm going to use a 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:37.180
 as a reference to the folder 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.599
 is unique and she does not close it by the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.599
 mango 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.170
 and when I open the mic to see if they see and 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.390
 appears the kraft table from here appears 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.890
 the table declarer play here click here 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.160
 logo that is doing well 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:04.640
 let's continue 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:08.900
 crystal mothers and the little ones up 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.840
 they will sing to sing they reached to good 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.849
 wait there when I shut up 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.300
 a player sees and listens 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.220
 sky lock 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.070
 Alcantara will enlarge and 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.460
 let's go here on the other map on the map 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.460
 what do i say 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.159
 in the Caribbean is thinking I know good 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.469
 that is to determine if it is 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.589
 listening to you guys look when they walk by 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.589
 the snow but listen to the portal 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.370
 in this list that is preceded by 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.719
 listen and that means it's a 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.719
 microsoft this ministry 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.939
 carpet access is well installed 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.870
 and if they are of those that have to have in 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.510
 access folder 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.430
 you just have to do this you win 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.830
 minecraft that have the folder here 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.120
 I hope you do not hear anything 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.980
 they have series of quick sets and I 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.610
 I do not think I remember which one has 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.950
 less sound as is being explained and 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.260
 those that the folder that has 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.110
 more sound more sound more files what 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.270
 they will move to the one with the least status 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:42.090
 less good status files like that and already 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.400
 you do not see in the description I will put them 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:50.240
 how to do it like this in passing in this 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:53.900
 chair and as you can see I have everything 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.000
 I already explained how to do everything and I hope 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.849
 that this serves them is only for the 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.509
 worlds 6.2 because that's the folder 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:06.699
 access of that good then up to 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.470
 next video 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:12.169

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.629

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:31.949
 My life had been gone for a week 

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.949
 grandmother since my grandmother there is no internet 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:37.739
