hey everyone is Supra and this is my ET

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.599 
hey everyone is Supra and this is my ET
launcher<00:00:04.170> showdown<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.920> which<00:00:05.250> I'm<00:00:05.430> gonna

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
launcher showdown and which I'm gonna

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.589 
launcher showdown and which I'm gonna
give<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.029> fair<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.049> sensible<00:00:07.830> opinion<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.849> each

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
give a fair and sensible opinion on each

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.799 
give a fair and sensible opinion on each
of<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> launchers<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.370> which<00:00:12.090> situations

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of the launchers and in which situations

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189 
of the launchers and in which situations
they<00:00:13.019> excel<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.830> they<00:00:14.219> excel<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.990> JT

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
they excel if they excel and what JT

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
they excel if they excel and what JT
launcher<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> think<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> most<00:00:17.520> stable

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
launcher I think is the most stable

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870 
launcher I think is the most stable
reliable<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.900> versatile<00:00:19.770> option<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.699> what

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
reliable and versatile option with what

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
reliable and versatile option with what
I've<00:00:21.000> seen<00:00:21.270> using<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.710> ato<00:00:23.039> launchers

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I've seen using all of the ato launchers

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849 
I've seen using all of the ato launchers
there<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:24.000> more<00:00:24.240> factors<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.470> damage

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
there are more factors to the damage

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.240 
there are more factors to the damage
output<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> seems<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.019> hit<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.680> tank

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
output now it seems if you hit a tank

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
output now it seems if you hit a tank
from<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.640> 90<00:00:29.849> degree<00:00:30.179> angle<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.720> does<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:31.050> more

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
from a 90 degree angle it does much more

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.950 
from a 90 degree angle it does much more
damage<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:31.890> hanging<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.910> 10<00:00:33.750> degree

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
damage than hanging it from a 10 degree

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
damage than hanging it from a 10 degree
angle<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.829> realistic<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> can't

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
angle which is realistic so I can't

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
angle which is realistic so I can't
argue<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.140> let's<00:00:37.170> start<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
argue with that so let's start with the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.209 
argue with that so let's start with the
MBT<00:00:38.790> law<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.809> law<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> N<00:00:40.350> law<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
MBT law or they in law the N law is the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
MBT law or they in law the N law is the
engineer<00:00:41.930> anti-tank<00:00:42.930> launcher<00:00:43.379> crutch<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
engineer anti-tank launcher crutch and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.750 
engineer anti-tank launcher crutch and
is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> worst<00:00:45.510> eighty<00:00:45.930> launcher<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:47.430> all

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
is the worst eighty launcher of all

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.650 
is the worst eighty launcher of all
other<00:00:48.000> ones<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> eighty<00:00:51.090> launchers

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
other ones of all the eighty launchers

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
other ones of all the eighty launchers
that<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.800> they're<00:00:53.160> only

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that you can use because they're only

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.029 
that you can use because they're only
senses<00:00:54.120> other<00:00:54.480> vehicles<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
senses other vehicles from about one to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.020 
senses other vehicles from about one to
two<00:00:56.070> meters<00:00:56.520> away<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:57.180> basically<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.199> weak<00:00:59.030> RPG

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
two meters away as basically a weak RPG

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
two meters away as basically a weak RPG
I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> n<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I think for the n lot to actually be a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
I think for the n lot to actually be a
feasible<00:01:02.520> option<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:03.120> need<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> increase

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
feasible option they need to increase

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.649 
feasible option they need to increase
the<00:01:04.559> range<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.460> senses<00:01:05.970> vehicles

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the range in which it senses vehicles

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
the range in which it senses vehicles
around<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.470> five<00:01:07.770> meters

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
around it's about five meters

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.390 
around it's about five meters
you<00:01:08.460> unlock<00:01:08.700> RPGs<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.720> somewhat<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> sigh<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
you unlock RPGs as somewhat a sigh of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
you unlock RPGs as somewhat a sigh of
relief<00:01:11.610> after<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.390> end<00:01:12.510> law<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
relief after the end law because of the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.249 
relief after the end law because of the
factor<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.939> angle<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> impact<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
factor of which angle you impact the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.700 
factor of which angle you impact the
target<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.280> deck<00:01:17.520> takes<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> damage<00:01:18.299> output

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
target that deck takes the damage output

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
target that deck takes the damage output
sometimes<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.189> less<00:01:20.580> damage<00:01:21.030> output

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
sometimes you can get less damage output

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.590 
sometimes you can get less damage output
than<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.710> in-law<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.820> Rockets

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
than that of an in-law but Rockets

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.469 
than that of an in-law but Rockets
overall<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.710> easier<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.210> have

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
overall are easier to use because I have

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
overall are easier to use because I have
velocity<00:01:28.020> compared<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> battlefield<00:01:28.770> 3

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
velocity compared at the battlefield 3

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.880 
velocity compared at the battlefield 3
but<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.420> feel<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:31.439> inclined<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
but I just don't feel really inclined to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
but I just don't feel really inclined to
give<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.759> an<00:01:33.240> opinion<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.810> them

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
give much more of an opinion about them

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
give much more of an opinion about them
because<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> try<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:36.000> stuff<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
because I want to try out more stuff and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.539 
because I want to try out more stuff and
you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> everything<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.340> more

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you know of everything is much more

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.240 
you know of everything is much more
interesting<00:01:39.060> than<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.420> RPGs<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:41.130> we've

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
interesting than the RPGs because we've

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
interesting than the RPGs because we've

battlefield 4 compared to battlefield 3
is<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.170> keep<00:01:52.350> painting<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
is that you have to keep painting it and

is that you have to keep painting it and
that<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.420> impact<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> top<00:01:55.530> instead

most people's favorite simply because

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.330 
most people's favorite simply because
it's<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.720> most<00:02:13.170> free<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.770> use

it's the most free to use

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's the most free to use
because<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.970> shoot<00:02:15.480> anything<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.830> the

it's the slowest velocity projectile so

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.630 
it's the slowest velocity projectile so
you<00:02:24.629> can't<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.769> engage<00:02:25.890> anything<00:02:26.519> at

Bad Company 2 is a reference to think by
here<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.430> because<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.819> was<00:02:44.879> wire<00:02:45.420> gated<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
here and because that was wire gated you

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.430 
here and because that was wire gated you
had<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.500> sometimes<00:02:47.630> put<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> target<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.410> of

had to sometimes put the target out of

had to sometimes put the target out of

your line of sight to even have the

your line of sight to even have the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
missile impact and that's why that was

such a skill-based tool to use I still

such a skill-based tool to use I still
say<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.880> ash<00:02:57.090> raw<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.959> most

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
say that the ash raw is the most

requires<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.950> most<00:02:59.069> skill<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.489> use<00:02:59.519> it's<00:02:59.970> just

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
requires the most skill to use it's just

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.750 
requires the most skill to use it's just
easier<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.780> use<00:03:01.079> than<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.709> wire<00:03:02.069> gated<00:03:02.549> one

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
easier to use than a wire gated one

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.250 
easier to use than a wire gated one
maybe<00:03:03.150> I'm<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.480> talking<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.810> whole<00:03:03.959> load<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
maybe I'm just talking a whole load of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.670 
maybe I'm just talking a whole load of
bollocks<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.950> that's<00:03:05.340> what<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> feel<00:03:05.849> like<00:03:06.180> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
bollocks but that's what I feel like is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.520 
bollocks but that's what I feel like is
lastly<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.829> have<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.430> mark<00:03:08.819> 153<00:03:09.629> small<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
lastly we have the mark 153 small and I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220 
lastly we have the mark 153 small and I
rate<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.090> most<00:03:12.269> stable<00:03:12.959> and

reliable and versatile option and it's

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.710 
reliable and versatile option and it's
my<00:03:16.709> favorite<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.560> their<00:03:19.560> being<00:03:19.859> rated

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
my favorite because of their being rated

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.629 
my favorite because of their being rated
second<00:03:21.720> hardest<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.260> use<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.340> will<00:03:23.430> do

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
second hardest to use so that it will do

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.520 
second hardest to use so that it will do
almost<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.090> same<00:03:24.329> damage<00:03:24.600> output<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.260> an<00:03:25.380> RPG

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
almost the same damage output is an RPG

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
almost the same damage output is an RPG
but<00:03:26.239> because<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:28.019> much<00:03:28.950> more<00:03:29.220> easy<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.790> zero

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
but because it's much more easy to zero

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.339 
but because it's much more easy to zero
and<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:31.650> has<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:32.010> same<00:03:32.190> velocity<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.819> an<00:03:33.000> RPG

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
you can hit long-range targets or hit

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.400

anything<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.579> much<00:03:38.849> more<00:03:39.090> accurately<00:03:39.599> which

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
anything just much more accurately which

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.890 
anything just much more accurately which
leads<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.220> higher<00:03:41.819> damage<00:03:42.180> output<00:03:42.540> array

leads to higher damage output array

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.289 
leads to higher damage output array
being<00:03:43.380> most<00:03:43.680> versatile<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.700> can<00:03:45.120> use

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
being most versatile because you can use

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.690 
being most versatile because you can use

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
from that and be pretty accurate because

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.129 
from that and be pretty accurate because
tanks<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.609> take<00:03:59.849> more<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.299> beating<00:04:00.630> now<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
tanks can take more of a beating now and

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.020 
tanks can take more of a beating now and
there<00:04:01.650> are<00:04:01.680> more<00:04:01.980> factors<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.760> dictate

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there are more factors that dictate

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.740 
there are more factors that dictate
damage<00:04:03.750> at<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.500> mark<00:04:04.739> 153<00:04:05.549> small<00:04:05.849> as<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.389> more

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
damage at the mark 153 small as a more

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.080 
damage at the mark 153 small as a more
reliable<00:04:07.079> option<00:04:07.769> because<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.760> allowing

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
reliable option because of it allowing

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.970 
reliable option because of it allowing
you<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.419> be<00:04:09.540> much<00:04:09.840> more<00:04:10.019> accurate<00:04:10.290> compared<00:04:10.889> to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you to be much more accurate compared to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.210 
you to be much more accurate compared to
the<00:04:11.099> RPG<00:04:11.609> so<00:04:12.389> hopefully<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.220> sensible

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
the RPG so hopefully that was a sensible

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.690 
the RPG so hopefully that was a sensible
and<00:04:14.370> fair<00:04:14.870> comparison<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.109> showdown<00:04:16.889> if<00:04:17.160> you

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and fair comparison and showdown if you

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.550 
and fair comparison and showdown if you
think<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.180> am<00:04:18.329> wrong<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.410> ash

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
think that I am wrong and that the ash

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.630 
think that I am wrong and that the ash
raw<00:04:19.950> or<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.729> javelin<00:04:21.209> or<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:22.070> RPG<00:04:23.070> beat<00:04:23.400> set

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
raw or the javelin or the RPG beat set

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.420 
raw or the javelin or the RPG beat set
then<00:04:24.030> go<00:04:24.930> ahead<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.440> tell<00:04:25.800> me<00:04:25.830> why<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.070> think

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
then go ahead and tell me why you think

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.830 
then go ahead and tell me why you think
