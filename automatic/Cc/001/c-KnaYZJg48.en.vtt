 Translator: Abderrahman Ait-Ali Checker: Ammar Alqatari 

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.734
 In 1960, I was still a student 

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.159
 I got a travel grant 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.220
 To study housing in North America. 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.504
 We traveled across the country. 

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.609
 We saw high-rise buildings for public housing 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.972
 In all major cities: 

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:31.046
 New York, Philadelphia. 

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.749
 Who without any choice lived there. 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.009
 Then we drove from suburb to suburb 

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.344
 Our thinkers promised it 

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.002
 We must re-invent residential buildings. 

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:43.216
 There must be another way to do this. 

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:45.460
 We can not keep the suburbs 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.240
 So let's design a building 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.345
 Which gives the qualities of a home 

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:52.578
 Per unit 

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:56.239
 The Habitat will be all about gardens, 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.350
 Contact with nature, 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.923
 The streets instead of the corridors, 

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:04.737
 We prepared it in advance in order to achieve the economy 

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:09.980
 Here, about 50 years later. 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.351
 It's a very desirable place to live. 

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.810
 It is now a heritage building, 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.413
 But it did not spread. 

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:24.117
 In 1973, I made my first trip to China 

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.383
 It was a cultural revolution. 

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:30.531
 We traveled across the country 

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.760
 We met with architects and planners. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.606
 This Beijing in that period 

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:38.848
 Not even one tall building 

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.132
 In Beijing or Shanghai. 

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:44.990
 Shenzhen did not even exist as a city. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.269
 There are hardly any cars. 

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.920
 Thirty years later, 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.915
 This is Beijing today. 

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.628
 This is Hong Kong. 

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.128
 If you are rich, live there, 

00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:00.548
 If you are poor, live there, 

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.214
 But they are high-density, and it's not just Asia. 

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.171
 Sao Paulo, you can travel 

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:07.695
 In a 45 minute helicopter 

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.705
 Seeing those tall buildings consume 

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:12.341
 Low-rise 19th century environment. 

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.652
 And with it comes congestion 

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:18.674
 And lose kinetic, and so on. 

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.224
 A few years ago, we decided to go back 

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.276
 And rethinking the building "Habitat". 

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.460
 Can we make it affordable? 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.148
 Can we achieve this quality in life? 

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:33.716
 In this tyranny density today? 

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:36.861
 We realized that it was basically about light 

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:39.406
 It's about the sun, it's about nature, 

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:41.522
 It's about the fractals 

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:44.740
 Can we open the building space 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.117
 In order to have more contact with the outside 

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:49.810
 We came with many models: 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.182
 Economic models, cheaper construction and more complete 

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:55.132
 Construction membranes 

00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:57.741
 People can then design their own homes 

00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.629
 And create their gardens 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.188
 We decided to try it in New York 

00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:06.144
 We looked down on Lower Manhattan 

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.401
 We appointed all the area buildings in Manhattan 

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:13.120
 On the left, Manhattan today 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.487
 Blue for buildings, red for offices, fragmentation. 

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:20.078
 On the right, we re-configured it 

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.145
 Office buildings from the ground 

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:25.140
 And then at a height of 75 floors above 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.135
 There are apartments. 

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:30.152
 There is a street in the air at level 25 

00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:32.201
 Social street. 

00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.158
 It is accessible. 

00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:35.361
 There are gardens and open spaces 

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.260
 Community. 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.176
 Almost every unit has its own garden 

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:43.250
 And community space around them. 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.159
 The most important, accessible, open. 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.282
 Do not constitute a wall or barrier in the city, 

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:52.176
 Light permeates everywhere. 

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:54.185
 In the previous two or three years 

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.307
 I have, for the first time 

00:03:56.307 --> 00:04:00.337
 We achieve the quality of life that in "Habitat" 

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:04.054
 In realistic projects across Asia. 

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:07.139
 These are in Qinhuangdao in China: 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.166
 Middle income housing, where there is an internal law 

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.598
 That on every compassion received 

00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:15.311
 Three hours of sunlight. 

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.268
 This is measured in the winter solstice 

00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:21.632
 Under construction in Singapore, 

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:24.860
 Apartments with three rooms, Apartments, one-roomed 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.707
 Public streets, parks, etc. 

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:31.133
 And Colombo. 

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:33.420
 I want to touch one other problem. 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.122
 It is a design of public places. 

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:40.688
 One hundred years after the start of construction 

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:42.458
 tall buildings, 

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.864
 We still need understanding 

00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:47.690
 How to become a high construction 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.426
 The foundation stone in building a city, 

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:53.373
 In creating the public domain 

00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:55.720
 In Singapore, we had the opportunity: 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.987
 10 million square feet, very high density. 

00:04:58.987 --> 00:05:03.134
 Considering the principle inside and outside 

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:05.356
 Roaming areas and gardens were included 

00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:07.508
 With dense urbanization. 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.104
 So there are open and closed places 

00:05:11.114 --> 00:05:13.120
 Moving from one to the other, 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.195
 There is a connection to nature, 

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:19.138
 More importantly, at all levels of structure, 

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:21.587
 Public gardens and open spaces. 

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:23.650
 On the platform surface, 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.492
 Up on the towers, 

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.373
 And finally on the roof, the garden 

00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:32.806
 Two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants, 

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:38.079
 The longest swimming pool in the world. 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.843
 That's all I can say in five minutes. 

00:05:40.843 --> 00:05:42.774
 thank you 

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:44.794
 (clap)
