is<00:01:17.840> pretty<00:01:18.229> bright<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:19.039> we've<00:01:19.670> got<00:01:19.880> maximum

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
is pretty bright and we've got maximum

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.769 
is pretty bright and we've got maximum
water<00:01:20.659> flow<00:01:21.020> here<00:01:21.289> I've<00:01:21.979> got<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> hose<00:01:23.149> right

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
water flow here I've got a hose right

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:26.649 
water flow here I've got a hose right
here<00:01:24.139> which<00:01:24.529> I'm<00:01:24.679> later<00:01:24.859> gonna<00:01:25.209> lay<00:01:26.209> on<00:01:26.240> top<00:01:26.389> of

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
here which I'm later gonna lay on top of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.559 
here which I'm later gonna lay on top of
the<00:01:26.840> gravel<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.499> fill<00:01:27.829> with<00:01:27.979> holes<00:01:28.389> so<00:01:29.389> that

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
the gravel and fill with holes so that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.239 
the gravel and fill with holes so that
it<00:01:29.689> feeds<00:01:29.990> evenly<00:01:30.409> across<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.740> top<00:01:31.039> of<00:01:31.069> the

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
it feeds evenly across the top of the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.969 
it feeds evenly across the top of the
gravel<00:01:31.840> then<00:01:32.840> I've<00:01:33.020> got<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.409> return<00:01:33.679> lines

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
gravel then I've got the return lines

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.569 
gravel then I've got the return lines
coming<00:01:34.909> from<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.649> container<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.490> will

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
coming from the container so there will

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.160 
coming from the container so there will
be<00:01:37.609> about<00:01:37.759> an<00:01:37.969> inch<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.240> water<00:01:38.450> in<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> quintus

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
be about an inch of water in the quintus

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.830 
be about an inch of water in the quintus
container<00:01:39.649> at<00:01:40.009> all<00:01:40.189> times<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.599> top

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
container at all times and then the top

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.109 
container at all times and then the top
part<00:01:42.109> will<00:01:42.679> not<00:01:42.859> be<00:01:43.039> filled<00:01:43.310> adjust<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
part will not be filled adjust the

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.389 
part will not be filled adjust the
bottom<00:01:44.270> inch<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.740> always<00:01:45.889> be<00:01:46.159> some

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
bottom inch so there always be some

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.480 
bottom inch so there always be some
water<00:01:46.609> in<00:01:46.789> here<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:48.409> can<00:01:48.529> see<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.979> also<00:01:49.189> have

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
water in here you can see I also have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.859 
water in here you can see I also have
two<00:01:49.700> more<00:01:49.880> holes<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.299> I<00:01:50.389> drilled<00:01:50.630> higher

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
two more holes that I drilled higher

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.099 
two more holes that I drilled higher
which<00:01:51.169> I<00:01:51.319> didn't<00:01:51.560> need<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.779> plugged<00:01:53.990> him

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
which I didn't need I can plugged him

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.039 
which I didn't need I can plugged him
off<00:01:54.259> with<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.469> hose<00:01:55.209> but<00:01:56.209> that<00:01:56.569> was<00:01:56.689> an<00:01:56.810> extra

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
off with a hose but that was an extra

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.219 
off with a hose but that was an extra
overflow<00:01:57.529> and<00:01:57.919> then<00:01:58.130> I've<00:01:58.249> got<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:59.229> returned

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
overflow and then I've got the returned

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.659 
overflow and then I've got the returned
water<00:02:00.729> pouring<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.939> with<00:02:02.090> high<00:02:02.270> pressure

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:03.669 
water pouring in with high pressure

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:07.120 
water pouring in with high pressure
which<00:02:04.669> is<00:02:05.169> agitating<00:02:06.169> the<00:02:06.259> water<00:02:06.439> nicely<00:02:06.709> for

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
which is agitating the water nicely for

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.010 
which is agitating the water nicely for
the<00:02:07.189> fish<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:09.080> that's<00:02:09.229> very<00:02:09.349> good<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:11.020> now

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the fish so that's very good and now

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.210 
the fish so that's very good and now
I've<00:02:12.140> got<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.380> get<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> gravel<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.040> there

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I've got to get the gravel in there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.360 
I've got to get the gravel in there
which<00:02:13.370> will<00:02:13.550> act<00:02:13.700> as<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.910> filter<00:02:14.450> media

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
which will act as a filter media

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.619 
which will act as a filter media
which<00:02:16.370> will<00:02:16.690> then<00:02:18.190> clean<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> water<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.540> I

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
which will then clean the water and I

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.330 
which will then clean the water and I
get<00:02:20.780> some<00:02:21.110> plants<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.250> gonna

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
get some plants in here so this is gonna

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.800 
get some plants in here so this is gonna
be<00:02:22.489> filled<00:02:22.730> up<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.000> top<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.390> gravel

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
be filled up to the top with gravel

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.610 
be filled up to the top with gravel
flush<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> top<00:02:24.739> with<00:02:25.730> gravel<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.620> might

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
flush to the top with gravel I might

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.289 
flush to the top with gravel I might
eventually<00:02:27.739> even<00:02:28.190> reduce<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.700> water<00:02:28.940> level

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
eventually even reduce that water level

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.470 
eventually even reduce that water level
a<00:02:29.330> little<00:02:29.599> bit<00:02:29.720> more<00:02:29.930> I'm<00:02:30.590> not<00:02:30.769> sure<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:31.480> it's

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
a little bit more I'm not sure if it's

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.940 
a little bit more I'm not sure if it's
probably<00:02:32.780> not<00:02:32.900> optimal<00:02:33.410> because<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.769> don't

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
probably not optimal because you don't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.490 
probably not optimal because you don't
want<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.160> lot<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.370> water<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.879> there<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:36.260> then

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
want a lot of water in there but then

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.430 
want a lot of water in there but then
again<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.640> want<00:02:37.819> some<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.360> there<00:02:38.569> for<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
again you want some in there for the the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.030 
again you want some in there for the the
way<00:02:39.530> my<00:02:39.680> system<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.190> working<00:02:41.260> eventually<00:02:42.260> I'm

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
way my system is working eventually I'm

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.979 
way my system is working eventually I'm
going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> set<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.610> timer<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.599> I'll

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
going to set up a timer so that I'll

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.500 
going to set up a timer so that I'll
have<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.500> system<00:02:45.860> fill<00:02:46.099> up<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:47.390> it

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
have the system fill up and then it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.509 
have the system fill up and then it
drain<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:48.440> fill<00:02:48.680> up<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.099> then<00:02:49.280> drain

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
drain and then fill up and then drain

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.059 
drain and then fill up and then drain
and<00:02:49.819> fill<00:02:49.849> up<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.480> drain<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.560> for<00:02:51.769> now<00:02:51.860> this

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
and fill up and drain but for now this

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.979 
and fill up and drain but for now this
is<00:02:52.129> just<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.489> very<00:02:52.670> simple<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.239> basic<00:02:53.269> system

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
is just a very simple and basic system

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.949 
is just a very simple and basic system
just<00:02:54.470> for<00:02:54.609> demonstration<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.720> get<00:02:56.810> some

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
just for demonstration and and get some

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.080 
just for demonstration and and get some
veggies<00:02:57.140> growing<00:02:57.620> out<00:02:57.739> here<00:02:57.819> then<00:02:58.819> I've<00:02:58.940> got

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
veggies growing out here then I've got

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.589 
veggies growing out here then I've got
to<00:02:59.180> cover<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.750> on<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.790> want<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.299> cover<00:03:02.480> all

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
to cover this up on I want to cover all

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.240 
to cover this up on I want to cover all
but<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.930> back<00:03:03.079> side<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.829> monitor<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
but the back side so I can monitor the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.009 
but the back side so I can monitor the
fish<00:03:04.459> where<00:03:05.060> they<00:03:05.120> want<00:03:05.299> all<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> sides<00:03:05.810> and

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
fish where they want all the sides and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.720 
fish where they want all the sides and
the<00:03:06.109> top<00:03:06.290> coverage<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:06.920> LG<00:03:07.340> doesn't<00:03:07.609> grow

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the top coverage so that LG doesn't grow

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.080 
the top coverage so that LG doesn't grow
in<00:03:07.760> there<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.370> there's<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
in there but there it is there's the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.390 
in there but there it is there's the
beginnings<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.569> an<00:03:11.690> aquaponics<00:03:12.290> system<00:03:15.400> way

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
beginnings of an aquaponics system way

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
beginnings of an aquaponics system way
down<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.790> creek<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.150> got<00:03:17.329> some<00:03:17.540> gravel

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
down to the creek and got some gravel

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.059 
down to the creek and got some gravel
just<00:03:18.910> free<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.180> scooping<00:03:20.829> now<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:21.889> want<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
just free for the scooping now I want to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.720 
just free for the scooping now I want to
put<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:24.200> then<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.769> can<00:03:25.430> put<00:03:25.579> some

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
put it in here and then I can put some

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.379 
put it in here and then I can put some
plants<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:27.459> all<00:03:28.459> right<00:03:28.579> there's<00:03:28.790> my<00:03:28.970> completed

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
plants in all right there's my completed

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.379 
plants in all right there's my completed
grow<00:03:29.720> bed<00:03:30.190> filled<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.459> ready<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.849> had<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.299> let

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
grow bed filled and ready I had to let

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.270 
grow bed filled and ready I had to let
some<00:03:32.660> water<00:03:33.139> out<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.709> system

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
some water out of the system

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.120 
some water out of the system
now<00:03:35.000> here<00:03:35.299> unfortunately<00:03:35.959> some<00:03:36.139> of<00:03:36.169> the<00:03:36.349> fine

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
now here unfortunately some of the fine

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.159 
now here unfortunately some of the fine
sand<00:03:37.519> has<00:03:37.910> clouded<00:03:38.239> up<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.569> water<00:03:38.780> but

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
sand has clouded up the water but

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.680 
sand has clouded up the water but
that'll<00:03:39.440> filter<00:03:40.010> itself<00:03:40.310> out<00:03:40.700> now<00:03:40.910> all<00:03:41.359> on<00:03:41.540> its

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
that'll filter itself out now all on its

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.589 
that'll filter itself out now all on its
own<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.230> gonna<00:03:42.380> filter<00:03:42.859> itself<00:03:43.160> out<00:03:43.599> through

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
own it's gonna filter itself out through

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.770 
own it's gonna filter itself out through
the<00:03:44.750> medium<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.400> I've<00:03:46.790> got<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.209> water<00:03:47.389> going

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
the medium so I've got the water going

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.099 
the medium so I've got the water going
in<00:03:48.590> over<00:03:48.769> here<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.940> then<00:03:50.239> it's<00:03:50.419> leaving<00:03:50.720> over

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
in over here and then it's leaving over

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.199 
in over here and then it's leaving over
here<00:03:51.380> now<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.370> might<00:03:52.700> notice<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:53.180> difference

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
here now you might notice the difference

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.030 
here now you might notice the difference
where<00:03:53.780> here<00:03:54.019> there's<00:03:54.169> a<00:03:54.230> lot<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.500> finer<00:03:54.709> stuff

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
where here there's a lot of finer stuff

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.550 
where here there's a lot of finer stuff
and<00:03:55.340> here<00:03:56.000> there's<00:03:56.180> some<00:03:56.419> bigger<00:03:56.599> stuff<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:57.200> put

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
and here there's some bigger stuff I put

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.190 
and here there's some bigger stuff I put
a<00:03:57.829> hand-picked<00:03:58.790> larger<00:03:59.569> stones<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.079> gravel

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
a hand-picked larger stones and gravel

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.470 
a hand-picked larger stones and gravel
and<00:04:00.590> put<00:04:00.739> them<00:04:00.859> in<00:04:00.950> over<00:04:01.129> here<00:04:01.400> by<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.609> exhaust

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and put them in over here by the exhaust

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.240 
and put them in over here by the exhaust
tubes<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.590> prevent<00:04:04.010> any<00:04:05.560> gravel<00:04:06.560> from<00:04:06.859> filling

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
tubes to prevent any gravel from filling

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.849 
tubes to prevent any gravel from filling
up<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.489> tubes<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.109> what<00:04:09.109> I<00:04:09.139> did<00:04:09.319> is<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.650> just

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
up the tubes and what I did is I just

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.890 
up the tubes and what I did is I just
filled<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.489> whole<00:04:10.760> section<00:04:11.299> with<00:04:11.449> larger

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
filled this whole section with larger

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.140 
filled this whole section with larger
gravel<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.579> prevent<00:04:13.819> that<00:04:14.090> from

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
gravel so as to prevent that from

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.229 
gravel so as to prevent that from
plugging<00:04:14.599> these<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.199> it<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.590> working<00:04:15.980> well

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
plugging these and it is working well

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.270 
plugging these and it is working well
and<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.299> might<00:04:17.510> hear<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.720> funny<00:04:17.989> sound<00:04:18.349> if<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
and you might hear a funny sound if you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.480 
and you might hear a funny sound if you
can<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:20.470> tubes<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.709> can<00:04:21.859> see<00:04:22.010> air<00:04:22.250> is

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
can see the tubes you can see air is

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.430 
can see the tubes you can see air is
being<00:04:22.669> sucked<00:04:23.030> through<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> system<00:04:24.349> is

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
being sucked through so the system is

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.920 
being sucked through so the system is
working<00:04:24.560> well<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.250> it's<00:04:26.120> actually<00:04:26.539> sucking

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
working well and it's actually sucking

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.750 
working well and it's actually sucking
air

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
air

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.540 
air
the<00:04:27.970> gravel<00:04:28.650> as<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:30.670> as<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.390> water<00:04:31.600> escapes<00:04:32.550> so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
the gravel as it as the water escapes so

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.040 
the gravel as it as the water escapes so
I<00:04:33.580> have<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.760> finely<00:04:34.090> balanced<00:04:34.420> system<00:04:34.600> now<00:04:34.900> it's

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
I have a finely balanced system now it's

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.440 
I have a finely balanced system now it's
working<00:04:35.410> well<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.780> exhaust<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.970> running

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
working well the the exhaust is running

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.450 
working well the the exhaust is running
back<00:04:40.570> into<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> fish<00:04:41.260> tank<00:04:41.560> at<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.100> same

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
back into the fish tank at the same

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.990 
back into the fish tank at the same
speed<00:04:42.910> as<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:44.440> water<00:04:44.650> pump<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.220> putting<00:04:45.850> water

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
up into the grill bed so next I've got

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.600 
up into the grill bed so next I've got
to<00:04:49.240> get<00:04:49.330> some<00:04:49.480> plants<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:49.900> here<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.410> I've<00:04:51.400> got

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
to get some plants in here and I've got

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.760 
to get some plants in here and I've got
myself<00:04:51.790> an<00:04:52.150> aquaponics<00:04:52.720> system<00:04:55.410> well<00:04:56.410> some<00:04:56.620> is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
myself an aquaponics system well some is

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.380 
myself an aquaponics system well some is
down<00:04:56.980> in<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.280> water<00:04:57.460> has<00:04:57.730> stopped<00:04:58.030> flowing

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
down in the water has stopped flowing

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.360 
down in the water has stopped flowing
for<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.870> bay<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.530> water<00:04:59.770> is<00:04:59.920> cleared<00:05:00.250> up

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
for the bay the water is cleared up

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.840 
for the bay the water is cleared up
pretty<00:05:00.610> decently<00:05:01.260> I'm<00:05:02.260> for<00:05:02.620> sure<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:03.130> couple

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
pretty decently I'm for sure a couple

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.280 
pretty decently I'm for sure a couple
hours<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.450> running<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.840> it'll<00:05:04.990> be<00:05:05.080> clean

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
hours of running and it'll be clean

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.580 
hours of running and it'll be clean
tomorrow<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.790> I<00:05:07.750> want<00:05:08.230> to<00:05:08.290> dig<00:05:08.410> up<00:05:08.560> some

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
tomorrow and I want to dig up some

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.890 
tomorrow and I want to dig up some
plants<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.250> put<00:05:09.370> them<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.580> here<00:05:09.820> look<00:05:10.690> around

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
plants and put them in here look around

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.550 
plants and put them in here look around
and<00:05:10.960> see<00:05:11.110> what<00:05:11.230> I<00:05:11.260> have<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.890> get<00:05:12.850> some<00:05:13.560> some

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
and see what I have and get some some

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.070 
and see what I have and get some some
lettuce<00:05:14.860> or<00:05:15.010> something<00:05:15.160> growing<00:05:15.640> in<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:16.080> and

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
lettuce or something growing in here and

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.650 
lettuce or something growing in here and
then<00:05:17.200> I'll<00:05:17.320> have<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.530> complete<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.820> figure

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
then I'll have it complete so figure

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.210 
then I'll have it complete so figure
tomorrow<00:05:19.990> that'll<00:05:20.260> be<00:05:20.320> clean<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.770> pure<00:05:21.040> and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
tomorrow that'll be clean and pure and

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.340 
tomorrow that'll be clean and pure and
then<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.090> whole<00:05:22.240> system<00:05:22.450> may<00:05:22.720> be<00:05:23.020> running

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
then the whole system may be running

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.800 
then the whole system may be running
smooth<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.010> efficiently<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:25.210> then<00:05:25.690> I'm

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
smooth and efficiently and then I'm

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.750 
smooth and efficiently and then I'm
gonna<00:05:25.930> put<00:05:26.230> a<00:05:26.380> battery<00:05:26.740> down<00:05:27.100> here<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.460> six<00:05:27.670> volt

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
gonna put a battery down here a six volt

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.610 
gonna put a battery down here a six volt
battery<00:05:28.270> because<00:05:28.570> that's<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.810> six<00:05:29.050> volt<00:05:29.110> pump

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
battery because that's a six volt pump

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.770 
battery because that's a six volt pump
and<00:05:30.180> I'm<00:05:31.180> gonna<00:05:31.360> run<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:33.240> solar<00:05:34.240> panel<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.660> the

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
and I'm gonna run the solar panel to the

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.440 
and I'm gonna run the solar panel to the
battery<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.410> battery<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.860> run<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.100> pump

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
battery and the battery to run the pump

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.210 
battery and the battery to run the pump
so<00:05:37.450> that<00:05:37.480> runs<00:05:37.810> day<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.080> night<00:05:38.230> that'll<00:05:39.130> be

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
so that runs day and night that'll be

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.450 
so that runs day and night that'll be
best<00:05:39.430> it'll<00:05:40.240> be<00:05:40.300> more<00:05:40.480> efficient<00:05:40.870> for<00:05:40.990> that

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
best it'll be more efficient for that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.610 
best it'll be more efficient for that
and<00:05:42.460> then<00:05:42.610> eventually<00:05:42.850> I'm<00:05:43.150> gonna<00:05:43.240> put<00:05:43.450> a

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
and then eventually I'm gonna put a

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.390 
and then eventually I'm gonna put a
timer<00:05:44.620> on<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.270> runs<00:05:46.510> a<00:05:46.660> 50%<00:05:47.470> duty

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
timer on that so that runs a 50% duty

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.360 
timer on that so that runs a 50% duty
cycle<00:05:48.520> I<00:05:51.270> have<00:05:52.270> completed<00:05:52.750> my<00:05:53.370> miniature

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
cycle I have completed my miniature

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.410 
cycle I have completed my miniature
aquaponics<00:05:55.180> setup<00:05:55.770> by<00:05:57.180> transplanting<00:05:58.180> some
