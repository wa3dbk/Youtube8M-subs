some all-wheel-drive cars rear-wheel
drive<00:00:35.530> cars<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.309> still<00:00:36.940> think<00:00:37.150> that<00:00:37.210> we're

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
drive cars I still think that we're

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.259 
drive cars I still think that we're
gonna<00:00:37.930> have<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.140> really<00:00:38.410> good<00:00:38.530> chance<00:00:38.590> of

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
gonna have a really good chance of

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.540 
gonna have a really good chance of
breaking<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.330> Time<00:00:40.480> Attack<00:00:40.510> record<00:00:41.140> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
breaking the Time Attack record and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.549 
breaking the Time Attack record and
coming<00:00:42.550> coming<00:00:43.000> home<00:00:43.239> number<00:00:43.420> one<00:00:43.570> if<00:00:44.379> the

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
coming coming home number one if the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.220 
coming coming home number one if the
weather<00:00:44.739> stays<00:00:45.040> well<00:00:45.400> we<00:00:45.699> think<00:00:46.180> we<00:00:46.269> can<00:00:46.420> do<00:00:46.570> a

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
weather stays well we think we can do a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.579 
weather stays well we think we can do a
low<00:00:47.800> 930<00:00:48.580> or<00:00:49.030> even<00:00:49.360> get<00:00:49.570> into<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.900> 920<00:00:50.410> the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
low 930 or even get into the 920 the

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.140 
low 930 or even get into the 920 the
bottom<00:00:53.589> section<00:00:53.830> is<00:00:54.129> very<00:00:54.370> fast<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.850> lot<00:00:55.030> of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
bottom section is very fast a lot of

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.450 
bottom section is very fast a lot of
momentum<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.769> to<00:00:56.890> keep<00:00:57.040> your<00:00:57.220> speed

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
momentum really have to keep your speed

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.060 
momentum really have to keep your speed
up<00:00:57.640> not<00:00:58.510> over<00:00:58.750> slow<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.080> car<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.589> can<00:00:59.739> really

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
up not over slow the car that can really

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.979 
up not over slow the car that can really
kill<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.309> down<00:01:00.610> there<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.150> bottom<00:01:01.510> part<00:01:01.780> is

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
kill you down there the bottom part is

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.140 
kill you down there the bottom part is
very<00:01:02.589> much<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> momentum<00:01:03.610> part<00:01:03.820> there's<00:01:04.030> only

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
very much a momentum part there's only

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.719 
very much a momentum part there's only
two<00:01:04.510> two<00:01:05.320> or<00:01:05.470> three<00:01:05.710> hair<00:01:05.920> pins<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.430> bottom

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
two two or three hair pins on the bottom

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.480 
two two or three hair pins on the bottom
the<00:01:06.909> rest<00:01:07.119> is<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:07.450> all<00:01:07.650> sweeping<00:01:08.650> turns<00:01:08.890> so

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the rest is just all sweeping turns so

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.120 
the rest is just all sweeping turns so
I'm<00:01:09.549> able<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.909> go<00:01:10.119> out<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.650> corners

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
I'm able to go out of the the corners

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.370 
I'm able to go out of the the corners
full<00:01:12.700> throttle<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.510> when<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.810> tires<00:01:14.020> are<00:01:14.140> hot

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
full throttle and when the tires are hot

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.109 
full throttle and when the tires are hot
I'm<00:01:14.560> not<00:01:14.710> getting<00:01:14.950> anything<00:01:15.159> else

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.800 

the<00:01:19.869> middle<00:01:20.140> section<00:01:20.670> becomes<00:01:21.670> very<00:01:21.880> twisty<00:01:22.390> a

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the middle section becomes very twisty a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.020 
the middle section becomes very twisty a
lot<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.259> lot<00:01:23.799> of<00:01:23.950> hair<00:01:24.100> pins<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.579> then<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.789> top

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
lot a lot of hair pins and then the top

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.050 
lot a lot of hair pins and then the top
is<00:01:25.390> fast<00:01:26.109> again<00:01:26.590> with<00:01:27.159> even<00:01:27.429> some<00:01:27.549> down<00:01:27.759> hills

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
is fast again with even some down hills

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.209 
is fast again with even some down hills
with<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.479> turbocharger<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.439> we<00:01:29.590> have<00:01:29.829> we

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
with the turbocharger that we have we

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.969 
with the turbocharger that we have we
get<00:01:30.369> more<00:01:30.549> of<00:01:30.640> an<00:01:30.729> advantage<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.359> top<00:01:31.859> than<00:01:32.859> we

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
get more of an advantage of top than we

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.410 
get more of an advantage of top than we
do<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.310> bottom<00:01:33.609> on<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.759> bottom<00:01:34.090> we<00:01:34.210> seem

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
do on the bottom on the bottom we seem

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.319 
do on the bottom on the bottom we seem
to<00:01:34.450> be<00:01:34.600> pretty<00:01:34.719> equal<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:36.069> David<00:01:36.819> Donner<00:01:37.000> and

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
to be pretty equal with David Donner and

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.559 
to be pretty equal with David Donner and
Jeff<00:01:37.509> Ward's<00:01:38.380> who<00:01:38.860> are<00:01:39.610> running<00:01:39.789> Porsches<00:01:40.360> I

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
Jeff Ward's who are running Porsches I

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.599 
Jeff Ward's who are running Porsches I
still<00:01:40.959> think<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:42.039> Genesis<00:01:42.429> Coupe

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
still think that the the Genesis Coupe

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.880 
still think that the the Genesis Coupe
will<00:01:42.789> have<00:01:42.909> an<00:01:43.000> advantage<00:01:43.240> about<00:01:45.840> qualifying

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will have an advantage about qualifying

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.160 
will have an advantage about qualifying
times<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.670> year<00:01:48.880> was<00:01:49.179> couldn't<00:01:49.990> have<00:01:50.079> been

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
times this year was couldn't have been

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.789 
times this year was couldn't have been
any<00:01:50.350> closer

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
any closer

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.279 
any closer
David<00:01:51.549> beat<00:01:51.729> me<00:01:51.880> by<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.360> tenth<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.810> second<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
David beat me by a tenth of a second and

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.249 
David beat me by a tenth of a second and
we<00:01:54.009> kind<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> history<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.259> running

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
we kind of have a history of running

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.499 
we kind of have a history of running
close<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.770> beat<00:01:56.950> him<00:01:57.069> beat<00:01:57.429> him<00:01:57.549> up<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.909> for

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
close I beat him beat him up here for

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.649 
close I beat him beat him up here for
the<00:01:58.599> overall<00:01:58.869> win<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.619> think<00:02:00.039> goes<00:02:00.280> back<00:02:00.310> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the overall win I think goes back in

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.969 
the overall win I think goes back in
2004<00:02:01.659> by<00:02:03.060> 2/10<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.119> a<00:02:04.209> second<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.770> never

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
2004 by 2/10 of a second but you never

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.319 
2004 by 2/10 of a second but you never
know<00:02:06.189> what's<00:02:06.369> gonna<00:02:06.459> happen<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.909> race<00:02:07.119> day

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
know what's gonna happen on race day

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.109 
know what's gonna happen on race day
that's<00:02:07.479> why<00:02:07.659> they<00:02:07.869> run<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.170> race<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.910> win

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
that's why they run the race don't win

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's why they run the race don't win
on<00:02:10.149> paper<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:11.019> a<00:02:11.110> hurry-up-and-wait

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
on paper it's a hurry-up-and-wait

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.699 
on paper it's a hurry-up-and-wait
atmosphere<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:12.849> day<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.260> want<00:02:14.650> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
atmosphere all day and you just want to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.100 
atmosphere all day and you just want to
get<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.069> there<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.670> done<00:02:15.700> because

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
get up there and get it done because

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.039 
get up there and get it done because
you're<00:02:17.110> building<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> adrenaline<00:02:18.310> before

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
you're building the adrenaline before

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.819 
you're building the adrenaline before
before<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.200> run<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.709> as<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:22.209> gets<00:02:22.360> delayed

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
before the run and as it gets delayed

00:02:22.829 --> 00:04:43.219 
before the run and as it gets delayed
you<00:02:23.829> tend<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.370> little<00:02:24.549> bit<00:02:24.760> edge

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.830 

well<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:44.680> just<00:04:45.069> missed<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.490> weather<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:46.210> got<00:04:46.810> a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
well we just missed the weather I got a

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
little bit of it I was just really

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.249 
little bit of it I was just really
anxious<00:04:48.639> at<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:48.970> line<00:04:49.240> because<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:49.990> could<00:04:50.139> see

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
anxious at the line because I could see

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.800 
anxious at the line because I could see
the<00:04:50.380> summit<00:04:50.620> was<00:04:50.889> very<00:04:51.130> cloudy<00:04:51.660> when<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.690> took

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810

off<00:04:53.050> off<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.289> line<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:54.729> road<00:04:54.910> was<00:04:55.090> really

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
off off the line the road was really

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.120 
off off the line the road was really
slippery<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.900> lot<00:04:56.139> more<00:04:56.319> so<00:04:56.560> than<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.919> practice

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
slippery a lot more so than in practice

tenth of a second and I was I was happy

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.020 
tenth of a second and I was I was happy
it<00:05:14.259> was<00:05:14.380> enough<00:05:14.680> David<00:05:15.130> was<00:05:15.310> about<00:05:15.669> six

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
it was enough David was about six

it was enough David was about six
seconds<00:05:16.360> back<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:17.740> was<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.009> was<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.370> was<00:05:18.460> a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
seconds back it was it was it was a

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.309 
seconds back it was it was it was a
close<00:05:18.699> race<00:05:18.819> a<00:05:19.000> lot<00:05:19.300> closer<00:05:19.539> than<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:19.810> wanted<00:05:20.199> it

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
close race a lot closer than I wanted it

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.430 
close race a lot closer than I wanted it
to<00:05:20.440> be<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> Hyundai<00:05:21.550> Genesis<00:05:21.970> Coupe<00:05:22.440> ran

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
to be but the Hyundai Genesis Coupe ran

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.680 
to be but the Hyundai Genesis Coupe ran
great<00:05:23.710> plenty<00:05:24.069> of<00:05:24.159> power<00:05:24.310> up<00:05:24.550> there<00:05:24.729> and<00:05:25.030> I

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
great plenty of power up there and I

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.120 
great plenty of power up there and I
think<00:05:25.900> that's<00:05:26.110> what<00:05:26.349> really<00:05:26.380> got<00:05:26.800> me<00:05:27.009> the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
think that's what really got me the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.199 
think that's what really got me the
advantage<00:05:27.520> over<00:05:27.699> over<00:05:28.479> David<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:28.930> Porsche
