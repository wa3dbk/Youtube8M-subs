and this is the new fat boy nokia
wireless<00:00:11.700> charger<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.870> supposed<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.349> be<00:00:13.790> she

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
wireless charger it's supposed to be she

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.140 
wireless charger it's supposed to be she
compatible<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.940> understand<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> lot

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
compatible but it's not understand a lot

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.210 
compatible but it's not understand a lot
of<00:00:18.270> information<00:00:18.779> around<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> Nets<00:00:19.350> regarding

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of information around the Nets regarding

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.730 
of information around the Nets regarding
this<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> thought<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.170> best<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:22.650> up

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
this so I thought it was best to put up

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.730 
this so I thought it was best to put up

4g<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.100> others<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:38.850> know<00:00:39.980> anyway

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
4g on the others so I don't know anyway

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.630 
4g on the others so I don't know anyway
this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.550> looks<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.329> real<00:00:42.480> nice

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
this is how it looks like it's real nice

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
this is how it looks like it's real nice
inside<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> normal<00:00:46.190> nokia

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
inside it's actually the normal nokia

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.119 
inside it's actually the normal nokia
charger<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> exact<00:00:48.840> same<00:00:49.110> charger<00:00:49.530> which

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
charger is the exact same charger which

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.119 
charger is the exact same charger which
you<00:00:50.250> will<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.960> anyway<00:00:51.960> I've<00:00:52.710> been<00:00:52.770> crying

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you will see anyway I've been crying

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.290 
you will see anyway I've been crying
with<00:00:54.710> 230<00:00:55.710> volts<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:56.969> Sweden

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
with 230 volts which we have in Sweden

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
with 230 volts which we have in Sweden
and<00:00:57.480> also<00:00:57.780> 110<00:00:58.440> volts<00:00:59.090> as<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.250> transfer

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and also 110 volts as I have a transfer

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.990 
and also 110 volts as I have a transfer
mater<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:06.170> as<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> see

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
mater so basically here we go as you see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.320 
mater so basically here we go as you see
it<00:01:09.090> sets<00:01:09.600> charging<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.010> start<00:01:11.369> cycling<00:01:11.729> as

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it sets charging but it start cycling as

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
it sets charging but it start cycling as
it's<00:01:12.960> connected<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> charger<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.380> goes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
it's connected to charger and this goes

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's connected to charger and this goes
on<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.369> while<00:01:17.869> sometimes<00:01:18.869> works<00:01:19.290> for

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
on for a while sometimes works for

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
on for a while sometimes works for
several<00:01:19.979> minutes<00:01:20.189> sometimes<00:01:21.090> stop

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
several minutes sometimes stop

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
several minutes sometimes stop
completely<00:01:23.360> what<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> found<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:25.049> by<00:01:25.830> letting

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
completely what I found out by letting

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.100 
completely what I found out by letting
it<00:01:26.820> sit<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.330> while<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:29.180> basically<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it sit for a while is that basically the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
it sit for a while is that basically the
battery<00:01:31.799> gets<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> warm<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.880> actually

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
battery gets so warm that it actually

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.819 
battery gets so warm that it actually
shuts<00:01:33.509> down<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.140> charging<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.680> see

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
shuts down the charging as you can see

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.429 
shuts down the charging as you can see
on<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> graph<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:42.450> last<00:01:42.689> part<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
on this graph the last part down in the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.679 
on this graph the last part down in the
corner<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> arm<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.610> actual<00:01:50.939> charging

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
corner is the arm the actual charging

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.219 
corner is the arm the actual charging
with<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.979> device<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.869> looks<00:01:54.930> almost<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
with this device it looks almost like it

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
with this device it looks almost like it
looks<00:01:58.229> almost<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> USB<00:01:59.280> charging<00:01:59.610> it's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
looks almost like the USB charging it's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
looks almost like the USB charging it's
blue<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.659> notice<00:02:00.899> application<00:02:01.439> which

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
blue if you notice application which

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.389 
blue if you notice application which
means<00:02:02.280> USB<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> clearly<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:04.920> drawing

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
means USB so clearly it's not drawing

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.650 
means USB so clearly it's not drawing
that<00:02:05.670> much<00:02:06.740> energy<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.509> can

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that much energy out of it and you can

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.880 
that much energy out of it and you can
also<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.959> how<00:02:10.050> its<00:02:10.200> tolls<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> end

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
also see how its tolls in the end

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.830 
also see how its tolls in the end
because<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.790> battery<00:02:12.090> gets<00:02:12.360> too<00:02:12.510> warm<00:02:12.690> i

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
because the battery gets too warm i

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.890 
because the battery gets too warm i
think

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
think

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.420 
think
and<00:02:16.790> here<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.909> your<00:02:18.060> temperature<00:02:19.430> which

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and here is your temperature which

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.599 
and here is your temperature which
basically<00:02:20.700> goes<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.180> quite<00:02:21.450> high<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.459> then<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
basically goes up quite high and then it

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.780 
basically goes up quite high and then it
drops<00:02:24.180> again<00:02:24.359> when<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.719> stops<00:02:24.959> charging<00:02:25.790> not

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
drops again when it stops charging not

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.449 
drops again when it stops charging not
that<00:02:26.969> visible<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.890> guess<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
that visible but you know I guess you

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.800 
that visible but you know I guess you
take<00:02:29.700> my<00:02:29.849> word<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.150> also<00:02:33.299> see<00:02:33.599> in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
take my word for it you can also see in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
take my word for it you can also see in
the<00:02:33.989> native<00:02:35.180> battery<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.099> basic<00:02:41.310> let's

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
the native battery this is a basic let's

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.770 
the native battery this is a basic let's
assess<00:02:42.150> charging<00:02:42.689> wireless<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.329> keeps

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
assess charging wireless but it keeps

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.589 
assess charging wireless but it keeps
cycling<00:02:46.109> this<00:02:46.849> connector<00:02:47.849> shard<00:02:48.060> here<00:02:48.239> as<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
cycling this connector shard here as you

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.789 
cycling this connector shard here as you
can<00:02:48.629> see<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.109> native<00:02:52.319> graph

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
can see and here is the native graph

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.830

where<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.519> see<00:02:53.669> in<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.450> bottom<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.780> can

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
where you can see in the bottom you can

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
where you can see in the bottom you can
see<00:02:54.930> charging<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:56.189> set<00:02:56.609> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
see charging and it's actually set you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.589 
see charging and it's actually set you
see<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.329> starts<00:02:58.280> breaking<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.489> there<00:02:59.760> when<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
see it starts breaking up there when it

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.099 
see it starts breaking up there when it
stops<00:03:00.870> charging<00:03:02.389> you<00:03:03.389> can<00:03:03.510> all<00:03:03.629> see<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
stops charging you can all see that the

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.740 
stops charging you can all see that the
screen<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.439> on<00:03:05.389> approximately<00:03:06.389> the<00:03:06.540> same

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
screen is on approximately the same

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
screen is on approximately the same
amount<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.500> turns<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:07.980> whenever<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
amount because it turns on whenever it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.379 
amount because it turns on whenever it
actually<00:03:09.150> stopped<00:03:09.480> charging<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> short

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
actually stopped charging for a short

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.039 
actually stopped charging for a short
while<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:14.519> see<00:03:14.669> it<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.359> usable<00:03:15.659> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
while so as you can see it is usable to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.159 
while so as you can see it is usable to
some<00:03:16.230> extent<00:03:16.819> Carol<00:03:17.819> it's<00:03:17.879> not<00:03:18.150> enough<00:03:18.540> to

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
some extent Carol it's not enough to

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.210 
some extent Carol it's not enough to
even<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.500> worth<00:03:19.680> bothering<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:22.650> will<00:03:22.919> also

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
even be worth bothering and I will also

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.099 
even be worth bothering and I will also
try<00:03:24.169> without<00:03:25.169> the<00:03:25.680> fat<00:03:25.949> boy<00:03:26.629> it's<00:03:27.629> just<00:03:27.870> for

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
try without the fat boy it's just for

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.680 
try without the fat boy it's just for
well<00:03:28.979> at<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.510> looks

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
well at it and this is what it looks

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.069 
well at it and this is what it looks
like<00:03:33.949> the<00:03:34.949> actual<00:03:35.340> charger<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.659> is<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> same

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
like the actual charger this is the same

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:54.200 
like the actual charger this is the same
one<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.409> buy<00:03:37.970> from<00:03:38.970> Nokia

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.470 

some<00:03:54.720> people<00:03:55.050> have<00:03:55.170> been<00:03:55.940> saying<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.270> they

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
some people have been saying that they

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.460 
some people have been saying that they
found<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.870> sweet<00:03:58.020> spot<00:03:59.210> to<00:04:00.210> be<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.810> half<00:04:01.320> an

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
found a sweet spot to be like half an

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.380 
found a sweet spot to be like half an
inch<00:04:02.240> below<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.390> actual<00:04:04.080> charger<00:04:05.360> but<00:04:06.360> I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
inch below the actual charger but I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.770 
inch below the actual charger but I
haven't<00:04:06.660> found<00:04:06.810> any<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:08.120> basically<00:04:09.120> think<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
haven't found any I basically think that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.200 
haven't found any I basically think that
people<00:04:10.110> only<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.830> because<00:04:11.250> looks

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
people only think that because looks

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.060 
people only think that because looks
like<00:04:12.390> charting<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.290> person<00:04:13.740> is<00:04:13.920> actually

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
like charting and the person is actually

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.820 
like charting and the person is actually
racing<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.700> beginning<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.410> assume

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
racing in the beginning so I assume

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.110 
racing in the beginning so I assume
that's<00:04:17.010> that's<00:04:17.520> what's<00:04:17.790> going<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.090> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
that's that's what's going on so for a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.060 
that's that's what's going on so for a
while<00:04:21.270> it's<00:04:21.540> yuki<00:04:22.140> sometimes<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.650> charge<00:04:22.890> for

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
while it's yuki sometimes the charge for

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040 
while it's yuki sometimes the charge for
like<00:04:23.190> 3-4<00:04:23.520> minutes<00:04:23.730> without<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.150> problem<00:04:24.420> but

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
like 3-4 minutes without a problem but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.170 
like 3-4 minutes without a problem but
then<00:04:25.170> it<00:04:25.260> stopped<00:04:25.440> charting<00:04:25.770> again<00:04:26.010> i'm<00:04:26.700> not

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
then it stopped charting again i'm not

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.240 
then it stopped charting again i'm not
sure<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.660> heat<00:04:27.810> problem<00:04:28.230> i<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:29.130> it's<00:04:29.220> a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
sure if the heat problem i think it's a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.700 
sure if the heat problem i think it's a
combination<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:30.330> does<00:04:30.510> get<00:04:30.810> quite<00:04:31.050> hot<00:04:31.170> after

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
combination it does get quite hot after

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.950 
combination it does get quite hot after
well<00:04:31.970> but<00:04:32.970> at<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.180> moment<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:33.930> a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
well but at the moment that is not a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.780 
well but at the moment that is not a
problem<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.160> it's<00:04:35.930> obviously<00:04:37.790> compatibility

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
problem so it's obviously compatibility

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.810 
problem so it's obviously compatibility
problems<00:04:39.180> as<00:04:39.300> well<00:04:40.370> that's<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.600> sorry<00:04:42.600> guys
