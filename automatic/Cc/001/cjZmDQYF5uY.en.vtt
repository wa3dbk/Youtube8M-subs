00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.180
 I'm going to make a hairstyle today for Nicole 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.070
 super bulky using some curlers 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.080
 velcro first let's wash the hair 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.090
 then dry it with the help of a brush 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.430
 round and then I show you the trick of 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 the curlers 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.150
 We have previously washed the hair with 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.040
 Gliss range the ultimate oil elixir 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 enriched with nutritious oils from 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.359
 Argan 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 first let's use a little foam 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 we will apply to the hair the amount of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.380
 size of a tennis ball very 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 important also apply on the nape 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 now we take velcro curlers you can 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 buy them in a drugstore or in a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.839
 Specialty store when hair 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 it's already dry, he rolled it with the curler and if 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.470
 you have to use two at the same time 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 they fix each other and you do not need to catch them 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.530
 with tweezers dries the hair a little and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.800
 then comb it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 and now with a big round brush 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 this one has natural boar bristles 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.739
 they are better because they give more shine to the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 hair I separate a section in the part 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 above the head is very important 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.559
 start at the top because that's how we avoid 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.450
 that collide with each other 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.479
 and he's going to show us how easy it is 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.479
 result 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.140
 and hold the hair wick and put the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.569
 velcro roller to roll it and fix it is 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 super easy and so we work all the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.759
 head on the sides roll down 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.500
 for the most professionals it is also 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.440
 can roll forward and so 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.540
 you gain a little extra volume 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.290
 but only with the basic form is it seen 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.100
 great as you see it is kept alone and so 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 work to the end 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.289
 we work the last section of the neck 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.960
 we roll up and we're already leaving the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.689
 curls a while we put again a 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.679
 little lacquer and after 15 minutes 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.149
 we remove the curlers we begin by the nape 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.009
 who wants to get even more volume 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.330
 can load the hair a little bit in the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.310
 root with a very large brush 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.410
 here in the last part load them 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 quickly alone at the root now 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.890
 Brush the hair lightly and pass 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.570
 also the fingers a great volume 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.950
 we went over we washed our hair and we have 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.840
 dried the hair with the help of a 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640
 round brush we have applied the curlers 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.110
 we let it cool posts and for 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.450
 finalize we have loaded a bit the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.000
 hair this hairstyle sure you can 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.840
