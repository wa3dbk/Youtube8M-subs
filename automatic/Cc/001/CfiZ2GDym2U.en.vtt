00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
hi today I want to show you how to

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.740 
hi today I want to show you how to
change<00:00:07.250> the<00:00:07.399> spot<00:00:07.730> flaw<00:00:07.970> on<00:00:08.149> the<00:00:09.100> sy<00:00:10.100> MVDs<00:00:10.720> 200

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
spot proper going to use should be the

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.689 
spot proper going to use should be the
ng<00:00:18.259> key<00:00:18.880> G<00:00:19.880> Powell<00:00:20.770> I'm<00:00:21.770> not<00:00:21.980> sure<00:00:22.130> how<00:00:22.279> much<00:00:22.490> it

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
ng key G Powell I'm not sure how much it

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.630 
ng key G Powell I'm not sure how much it
is<00:00:22.820> body<00:00:23.600> long<00:00:23.990> time<00:00:24.199> ago<00:00:24.470> for<00:00:24.710> space<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:25.369> I

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
is body long time ago for space and I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.310 
is body long time ago for space and I
feel<00:00:25.910> that<00:00:26.060> I<00:00:26.119> need<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.510> replace<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:26.869> today

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
feel that I need to replace it today

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.920 
feel that I need to replace it today
because<00:00:28.250> of<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.609> long<00:00:29.210> trip<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.630> I'm<00:00:29.720> going<00:00:29.900> to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
because of a long trip that I'm going to

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.500 
because of a long trip that I'm going to
do<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:30.980> is<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.640> spark<00:00:31.910> plug<00:00:32.150> this<00:00:32.330> is

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
do so this is the spark plug this is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.220 
do so this is the spark plug this is
standard<00:00:32.870> spot<00:00:33.379> long<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.630> it's<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.899> one<00:00:36.050> that

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
standard spot long and it's the one that

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.870 
standard spot long and it's the one that
recommended<00:00:36.530> for<00:00:37.480> sym<00:00:38.480> VDS<00:00:39.290> 200<00:00:39.800> right<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.760> get

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
recommended for sym VDS 200 right to get

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.650 
recommended for sym VDS 200 right to get
to<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.120> spark<00:00:41.420> plug<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:42.250> need<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.430> open<00:00:44.329> up

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
to the spark plug you need to open up

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.650 
to the spark plug you need to open up
this<00:00:45.399> left-hand<00:00:46.399> access<00:00:47.180> panel

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
this left-hand access panel

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.529 
this left-hand access panel
there's<00:00:48.200> no<00:00:48.410> tools<00:00:48.739> required<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:50.059> have

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
there's no tools required you just have

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:04.680 
there's no tools required you just have
to<00:00:50.719> slowly<00:00:51.399> pry<00:00:52.399> it<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.640> off<00:00:52.760> with<00:00:53.030> your<00:00:53.180> finger

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.940 

right<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:07.360> now<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.390> can<00:01:08.630> see<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.110> spark<00:01:09.710> plug

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
right so now you can see the spark plug

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.980 
right so now you can see the spark plug
in<00:01:10.610> there<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:12.229> take<00:01:12.530> out<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.040> camera

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
in there and then take out the camera

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.690 
in there and then take out the camera
that<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.229> spot<00:01:15.500> block<00:01:15.710> actually<00:01:16.670> I

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
that is the spot block actually I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.660 
that is the spot block actually I
already<00:01:16.909> remove<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:19.869> spark<00:01:20.869> plug<00:01:20.990> socket

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
already remove the spark plug socket

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.060 
already remove the spark plug socket
earlier<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:23.600> once<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.650> spark<00:01:24.920> plug

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
earlier so now once the spark plug

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.249 
earlier so now once the spark plug
socket<00:01:25.340> remove<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.360> need<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.689> spark<00:01:27.020> plug

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
socket remove you need the spark plug

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.990 
socket remove you need the spark plug
removal<00:01:28.299> this<00:01:29.799> socket<00:01:30.799> which<00:01:31.189> is<00:01:31.400> provided

panel<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.420> bought<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.840> long<00:02:40.019> time<00:02:40.049> ago<00:02:40.260> for

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
panel I bought this a long time ago for

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.900 
panel I bought this a long time ago for
my<00:02:40.799> bank<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.510> much<00:02:42.810> easier<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.380> use

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
my bank and this is much easier to use

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.530 
my bank and this is much easier to use
and<00:02:45.319> it's<00:02:46.319> magnetic<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.700> remove

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and it's magnetic so that I can remove

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.759 
and it's magnetic so that I can remove
the<00:02:48.720> spark<00:02:48.930> plug<00:02:49.049> easy<00:02:49.970> also<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:52.380> use<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the spark plug easy also I can use the

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.390 
the spark plug easy also I can use the
top<00:02:52.980> range<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.870> end<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:56.099> talk

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
top range on the end so that I can talk

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.479 
top range on the end so that I can talk
when<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> necessary<00:02:57.840> top<00:02:58.769> loading<00:02:59.040> for

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
when is the necessary top loading for

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.890 
when is the necessary top loading for
the<00:02:59.700> spark<00:02:59.970> plug<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.599> really<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
the spark plug but it's not really that

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.379 
the spark plug but it's not really that
critical<00:03:04.790> okay<00:03:06.079> that's<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.230> spark<00:03:07.530> plug<00:03:08.389> this

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
critical okay that's a spark plug this

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.080 
critical okay that's a spark plug this
one<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:09.930> about<00:03:10.280> 9,000<00:03:11.280> kilometers<00:03:11.400> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
one is really about 9,000 kilometers I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.090 
one is really about 9,000 kilometers I
just<00:03:12.450> want<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> change<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> look
