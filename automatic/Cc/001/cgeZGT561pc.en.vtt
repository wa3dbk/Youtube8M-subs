00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
let me skip deck stakes yes sir we're

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.990 
let me skip deck stakes yes sir we're
using<00:01:09.760> three<00:01:10.660> finger<00:01:11.110> wide<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.430> chunks

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
using three finger wide you know chunks

usually<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.930> ones<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.290> hit<00:01:17.440> are<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.590> ones

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
usually the ones that hit are the ones

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.200 
usually the ones that hit are the ones
in<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> back<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.460> that's<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> first

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
in the back because that's the first

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.749 
in the back because that's the first
bait<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.600> get<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.120 

just<00:01:23.630> keep<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.079> nose<00:01:24.289> up<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.619> river<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.009> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
just keep the nose up the river in the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.029 
just keep the nose up the river in the
current<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.750> drift<00:01:26.750> along<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.860> is

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
current and and drift along and this is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.770 
current and and drift along and this is
an<00:01:28.159> ideal<00:01:28.549> drift<00:01:28.939> right<00:01:29.119> here<00:01:29.329> really<00:01:29.659> just<00:01:31.780> a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
an ideal drift right here really just a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.190 
an ideal drift right here really just a
natural<00:01:33.200> flow<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.649> river<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:35.200> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
natural flow of the river and just a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.810 
natural flow of the river and just a
natural<00:01:36.619> presentation<00:01:37.009> because<00:01:37.490> that's<00:01:37.670> how

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
natural presentation because that's how

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.080 
natural presentation because that's how
it's<00:01:37.969> coming<00:01:38.179> by<00:01:38.390> them<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:38.869> just<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.850> chunk<00:01:40.850> of

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
it's coming by them it's just a chunk of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.690 
it's coming by them it's just a chunk of
fish<00:01:41.509> or<00:01:41.810> whatever<00:01:41.990> comes<00:01:42.409> by<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.860> they<00:01:42.950> go<00:01:43.490> up

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
fish or whatever comes by and they go up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.279 
fish or whatever comes by and they go up
and<00:01:43.939> get<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.270> lot<00:01:44.509> of<00:01:44.630> times<00:01:44.840> they'll<00:01:45.110> hit<00:01:45.259> it

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
and get it a lot of times they'll hit it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.069 
and get it a lot of times they'll hit it
in<00:01:45.500> your<00:01:45.649> line<00:01:45.890> will<00:01:46.159> just<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.490> slack<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.299> then

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
in your line will just go slack and then

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.569 
in your line will just go slack and then
the<00:01:48.200> next<00:01:48.439> thing<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.710> know<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.069> and<00:01:49.250> that's

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
the next thing you know it and that's

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.770 
the next thing you know it and that's
when<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.850> rod<00:01:50.149> loads<00:01:50.509> up<00:01:55.539> always<00:01:56.539> there

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
when that rod loads up always there

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.080 
when that rod loads up always there
right<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.130> told<00:01:58.459> you<00:01:58.789> when<00:01:58.939> they're

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
right there I told you when they're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.330 
right there I told you when they're
there<00:01:59.270> they're<00:01:59.539> there<00:01:59.569> now<00:02:00.049> just<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:01.099> good

there they're there now just a good

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.089 
there they're there now just a good
typical<00:02:01.909> drift<00:02:02.179> drift<00:02:02.840> size<00:02:03.200> fish<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.950> say<00:02:04.069> I

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
typical drift drift size fish and say I

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.730 
typical drift drift size fish and say I
can<00:02:04.280> do<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.490> okay<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:06.560> good

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
can do this okay just a good

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.279 
can do this okay just a good
