00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
sort of time to the right is it is it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.149 
sort of time to the right is it is it
good<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> riders<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> their

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
good for the riders to have their

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
good for the riders to have their
breakfast<00:01:08.670> before<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> how

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
breakfast before they go out and how

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
breakfast before they go out and how
long<00:01:10.260> between<00:01:10.439> eating<00:01:11.070> breakfast<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
long between eating breakfast and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
long between eating breakfast and
starting<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> good

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
starting the right well it's a good

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
starting the right well it's a good
question<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.350> basically<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.909> timing<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
question because basically the timing of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
question because basically the timing of
the<00:01:15.570> races<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.380> vary<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.040> bit<00:01:17.189> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the races can vary a little bit so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.270 
the races can vary a little bit so
breakfast<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.780> becomes<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.470> pre-race

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
breakfast really becomes that pre-race

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
breakfast really becomes that pre-race
meal<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.390> breakfast<00:01:21.900> roughly

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
meal so they have breakfast roughly

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
meal so they have breakfast roughly
three<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.490> four<00:01:23.759> hours<00:01:24.150> before<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.869> actually

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
three to four hours before they actually

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
three to four hours before they actually
start<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> race<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.509> eat<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.229> really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
start the race so they will eat a really

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
start the race so they will eat a really
good<00:01:29.280> sized<00:01:29.549> breakfast<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.630> you

glycemic index which just means that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.690 
glycemic index which just means that
that<00:04:03.760> energy<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.660> slow<00:04:05.170> release<00:04:05.530> for<00:04:06.190> also<00:04:06.519> for

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
that energy is slow release for also for

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.310 
that energy is slow release for also for
people<00:04:06.970> at<00:04:07.060> home<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.690> in<00:04:07.870> something<00:04:08.200> like

similar they're quite a low GI the very
good<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.359> soluble<00:04:19.780> fiber<00:04:20.020> which<00:04:20.320> again<00:04:20.530> is

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
good for soluble fiber which again is

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.640 
good for soluble fiber which again is
good<00:04:20.830> for<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.099> from

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
good for the from

good for the from
so<00:04:22.980> mixing<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> two<00:04:23.760> together<00:04:23.910> you're

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
so mixing the two together you're

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.140 
so mixing the two together you're
getting<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.930> really<00:04:25.320> nice<00:04:25.470> combination<00:04:26.340> okay

yep
i<00:04:43.410> boiled<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.310> banana<00:04:44.639> with<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.210> tiny<00:04:45.479> tiny<00:04:45.630> bit

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
i boiled the banana with a tiny tiny bit

okay like my a point so you could so
that's<00:04:51.270> just<00:04:51.389> water<00:04:51.630> just<00:04:52.260> rollers<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:52.919> a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
that's just water just rollers and a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.110 
that's just water just rollers and a
little<00:04:53.220> bit<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.370> sugar<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.639> little<00:04:53.760> bit<00:04:54.030> of
