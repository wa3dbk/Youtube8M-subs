00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
video somebody else posted that was

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540 
video somebody else posted that was
having<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> same<00:00:09.660> problem<00:00:09.980> so<00:00:10.980> I'm<00:00:11.400> just

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
having the same problem so I'm just

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700 
having the same problem so I'm just
going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> play<00:00:11.940> his<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.960> quick<00:00:13.230> because

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
going to play his really quick because

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010 
going to play his really quick because
it's<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> good<00:00:14.219> example<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.690> same<00:00:15.870> thing

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's a good example and the same thing

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.130 
it's a good example and the same thing
was<00:00:16.139> happening<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.619> me<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.730> Ram<00:00:18.570> previews<00:00:18.990> his

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
was happening to me so Ram previews his

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:35.870 
was happening to me so Ram previews his
project<00:00:33.680> all<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> audio

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
project all right so that's the audio

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.160 
project all right so that's the audio
and<00:00:36.090> RAM<00:00:36.239> preview<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> jump

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and RAM preview I'm going to jump

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
and RAM preview I'm going to jump
forward<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> audio<00:00:38.460> after<00:00:38.790> he<00:00:38.879> exports<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
forward to the audio after he exports it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:52.430 
forward to the audio after he exports it
where<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> sounds<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.320> should<00:00:51.260> all<00:00:52.260> right

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
where it sounds like it should all right

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
where it sounds like it should all right
obvious<00:00:52.890> difference<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
obvious difference there so that's the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
obvious difference there so that's the
problem<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.570> RAM<00:00:54.780> preview<00:00:55.050> preview<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> audio

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
problem in RAM preview preview the audio

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
problem in RAM preview preview the audio
plays<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.910> slowly<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> typically<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
plays back slowly and typically this is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
plays back slowly and typically this is
not<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> problem<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.460> me

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
not a problem for me

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.840 
not a problem for me
I<00:00:59.789> had<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.590> manifest<00:01:01.590> itself<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.250> time<00:01:02.550> before

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I had it manifest itself one time before

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.219 
I had it manifest itself one time before
but<00:01:03.359> uh<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:05.000> spent<00:01:06.000> probably<00:01:06.810> an<00:01:06.869> hour<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
but uh I spent probably an hour and a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.719 
but uh I spent probably an hour and a
half<00:01:07.409> last<00:01:07.680> night<00:01:07.890> trying<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> figure<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
half last night trying to figure this

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
half last night trying to figure this
out<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> finally<00:01:09.390> gave<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.900> went<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
out and finally gave up on it went to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.580 
out and finally gave up on it went to
bed<00:01:11.750> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> funny<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
bed which is funny because when I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
bed which is funny because when I
restarted<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.220> computer<00:01:14.310> after<00:01:14.880> trying<00:01:15.210> all

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
restarted my computer after trying all

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
restarted my computer after trying all
these<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:15.780> last<00:01:16.020> night<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.920> After

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
these things last night turn on After

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.929 
these things last night turn on After
Effects<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.000> audio<00:01:18.330> Ram<00:01:18.630> preview<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.380> fine

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
Effects the audio Ram preview just fine

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
Effects the audio Ram preview just fine
so<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:20.970> solution<00:01:21.509> might<00:01:22.049> work<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.799> if

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.370 
cs4 version of After Effects and mp3 is
worked<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.840> fine

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
worked just fine

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
worked just fine
typically<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.820> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.120> about<00:02:15.300> my

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
typically it's a little bit about my

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.200 
typically it's a little bit about my
project<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.170> had<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.410> problem<00:02:16.800> with

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
project that I had the problem with

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.470 
project that I had the problem with
I<00:02:18.500> brought<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:19.800> third<00:02:20.100> mp3<00:02:20.910> file<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
I brought in my third mp3 file and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
I brought in my third mp3 file and
that's<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.770> problem<00:02:23.160> manifested

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that's when the problem manifested

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
that's when the problem manifested
itself<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.240> audio<00:02:24.480> started<00:02:24.840> playing<00:02:25.050> back

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
itself in the audio started playing back

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.730 
itself in the audio started playing back
slowly<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.820> third<00:02:27.200> mp3<00:02:28.200> file<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.470> this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
slowly with that third mp3 file and this

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.120 
slowly with that third mp3 file and this
isn't<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> one<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.400> an<00:02:29.730> example<00:02:31.100> what<00:02:32.100> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
isn't the one that's an example what I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.210 
isn't the one that's an example what I
did<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.940> test<00:02:33.180> was<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.450> brought<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.840> other

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
did just to test was I brought up other

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.950 
did just to test was I brought up other
projects<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.400> After<00:02:35.970> Effects<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.510> had<00:02:36.720> used

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
projects in After Effects that had used

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.860 
projects in After Effects that had used
audio<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.880> after<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> problem<00:02:39.390> showed<00:02:39.660> up

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
audio and after the problem showed up

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.810 
audio and after the problem showed up
every<00:02:40.110> After<00:02:40.830> Effects<00:02:41.130> file<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.700> had

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
every After Effects file that I had

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.210 
every After Effects file that I had
worked<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.390> past<00:02:42.710> had<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.950> same

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
worked with in the past had the same

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.220 
worked with in the past had the same
problem<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.760> RAM<00:02:45.030> preview<00:02:45.270> audio<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:45.930> going

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
problem the RAM preview audio was going

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
problem the RAM preview audio was going
slowly<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.770> affected<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.670> entire<00:02:47.820> program

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
slowly it affected the entire program

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.920 
slowly it affected the entire program
with<00:02:48.720> all<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.170> projects<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.710> audio<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.940> none

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
with all the projects with audio so none

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
with all the projects with audio so none
of<00:02:51.960> those<00:02:52.140> projects<00:02:52.650> had<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> problem<00:02:53.340> playing

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
of those projects had a problem playing

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.700 
of those projects had a problem playing
the<00:02:54.360> audio<00:02:54.510> back<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> correct<00:02:55.470> speed

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
the audio back at the correct speed

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.410 
the audio back at the correct speed
before<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.340> after<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.700> problem<00:02:57.060> showed<00:02:57.270> up

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
before but after this problem showed up

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.210 
before but after this problem showed up
it<00:02:57.570> affected<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.350> my<00:02:58.560> files<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.920> only

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
it affected all of my files so the only

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.710 
it affected all of my files so the only
thing<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.580> works<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.120> found<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> by

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
thing that works and I found this by

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.450 
thing that works and I found this by
accident<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.320> restarting<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.430> computer

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
accident was restarting the computer

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.280 
accident was restarting the computer
because<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.450> said<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.630> shut<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.900> down<00:03:07.110> at

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
because like I said I shut it down at

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.800 
because like I said I shut it down at
night<00:03:07.470> woke<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.550> turned<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.150> back<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.330> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
night woke up turned it back on and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.680 
night woke up turned it back on and
everything<00:03:10.290> was<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.650> fine

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
everything was just fine

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.770 
everything was just fine
so<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.880> video<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
so and just this video is just for the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.250 
so and just this video is just for the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
purpose of telling you to try that first

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.380 
purpose of telling you to try that first
instead<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.380> spending<00:03:19.710> all<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.010> time

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
instead of spending all this time

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.570 
instead of spending all this time
researching<00:03:21.390> people's<00:03:22.110> ambiguous<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.220> shot

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
researching people's ambiguous and shot

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.260 
researching people's ambiguous and shot
in<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> dark<00:03:23.970> answers<00:03:25.370> before<00:03:26.370> trying<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
in the dark answers before trying that

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.570 
in the dark answers before trying that
I<00:03:27.300> even<00:03:27.870> tried<00:03:28.110> restarting<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.830> program<00:03:29.310> and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
I even tried restarting the program and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.400 
I even tried restarting the program and
that<00:03:30.210> didn't<00:03:30.570> work<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.870> needed<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
that didn't work it needed to be the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.500 
that didn't work it needed to be the
entire<00:03:31.680> computer<00:03:32.070> once<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.580> did<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
entire computer once I did that the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.120 
entire computer once I did that the
three<00:03:33.750> layers<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.110> audio<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.680> original

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
three layers of audio on my original

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.060 
three layers of audio on my original
file<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.640> all<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.240> other<00:03:36.860> audio<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
file and all the other audio and the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.420 
file and all the other audio and the
files<00:03:38.310> worked<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.150> fine<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.980> yeah<00:03:40.980> give<00:03:41.400> that
