00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.390
 Welcome to the minutes with more 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 positive energy of the day 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.470
 learn to take more energy 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.190
 electrical and to use it safely 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.800
 while having fun with silvio gold and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.740
 silvio voltio an educational program 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.530
 beats to positive energy so that 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.370
 it went well where his girlfriend don tomás yes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.370
 Clear 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.879
 of luck so that you are the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.960
 boyfriend of my daughter 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.740
 yes sir to serve you with pleasure and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.740
 know the iron 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 grilled to the grill the one that is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.210
 building you back in the yard yes 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 It's getting very good, no, sir. 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.070
 iron that the iron is known 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.350
 to grilled food maybe a 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.150
 single iron 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.650
 I love I like my dad very much 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.580
 please do not make fun of him is not that neither 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.760
 even understood 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 we did not know clearly that I understood well 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.020
 you were well presented to meet my dad 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 how are you going to come with that shirt like this 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.670
 it seems more expensive for a cow you lower the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.670
 iron and you come back later but my heaven 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.009
 that's so you see the importance of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 ironing of the carmencita clothes yes I 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.200
 do not ruin me what happens is that I 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.180
 forgot to iron the shirt 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.439
 you are an amazing artist everything 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.930
 that one can make an aparatico and 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.700
 how insignificant I do not know how 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.010
 that sheath brother works but now what 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.750
 miracle donás tomás but the iron 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.510
 works by loosening the molecules of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.700
 polymer that is in the fiber of the fabric 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.739
 the fibers stretch and maintain their shape 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 when it cools but this is achieved by 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.160
 medium heat in some fabrics like 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.170
 cotton we apply water to loosen the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.170
 inter molecular bonds or me 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.480
 aaron we do not know all the iron 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.690
 it requires a lot of power to work 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.340
 to establish a one hour relationship 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.400
 iron equals what with its light 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.680
 TV on for 24 hours or 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 a computer working in full 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.180
 performance for almost 7 hours 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.319
 and what they say is a 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.100
 very useful appliance very useful yes 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.630
 but for the obligated one you do not take the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.060
 iron and it's still a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.530
 very useful appliance what happens is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.260
 what to know how to use it in a way 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.420
 rational to take care of the pocket and the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.310
 environment we have already explained in 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.170
 this program that the ideal is not to walk 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420
 ironing at all times but ironing 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.580
 only once a week that when not 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.459
 go to finish turn off the iron to 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.560
 to work with the heat that is left 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.870
 neither is it advisable to use extensions 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.420
 electric to connect an iron and 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.850
 that these may not have 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.310
 electrical characteristics above never 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.220
 Remove from the place leaving the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.560
 iron in addition to wasting energy 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 you will be putting your 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.810
 safety or that of your family 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.000
 It is also important that when you use it 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.860
 Do not turn on another consumer device 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 example as the electric oven because 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.350
 overload electrical installations 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.350
 of the house 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.930
 one is supported by a 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.330
 for our planet to generate steam 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.150
 the steam irons should heat the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.739
 water consuming more energy so that's why 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.870
 you must use the iron to dry the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.030
 wet clothes take care of your pocket 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.160
 Take care of your planet so important not 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.570
 very good advice so that the neighborhood cndh 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.180
 It was great a coyote of a question 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.820
 it's from a certain sister Sarah Thomas because 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
 while you iron with an influx 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.169
 traditional tri is consumed from 800 to 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.560
 1,000 watts on average instead a 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.139
 steam iron consumes 1200 or up 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 1500 several grams sr 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.039
 so if I have a shore board 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.620
 I have it true indeed is my iron 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.660
 has touched so I do not do either with the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.210
 base drop just what you have to 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.130
 to do is to dose the water vapor that 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.350
 you have for the iron that is 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.090
 programmed another way they are not going to 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.039
 need also raised this rate your 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.990
 if you are going to pay for the iron if you are going to 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.449
 pay then you have to unplug the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.669
 because while the iron is not 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.289
 unplug and is connected is 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.070
 consuming in equipment very well today 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.380
 We learned to use the iron better 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.690
 true and have respect to the iron 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.220
 so that you are not going the pocket 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.360
 protect the environment 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.360
 see you later chao
