00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello closer and closer new 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.480
 summer season 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.360
 and with him catching a good big bream 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.690
 one of the very good baits for such 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.060
 catching are pasta i'm even 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.890
 I have been using them in spite of the fact that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.600
 There is a prejudice that this 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.970
 nozzles for clubs Yshchikov and that it is not 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.160
 sports is not fashionable and modern yet 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.250
 less pasta is still quite 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.370
 a good nozzle and i prefer to have in 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.890
 his arsenal when leaving for the summer 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.530
 fishing pasta so I had them 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.790
 certainly not as the only nozzle but 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.559
 how variety is very suitable 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.460
 what kind of pasta do we need we need 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 pasta 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.750
 stars that are very easy and convenient 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.239
 getting hooked before also thought 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.789
 that pasta cooks it pipe such 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.170
 taken or horns you really 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.800
 asterisk pasta perfect for 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 fishing 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.310
 what exactly is Italian 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.390
 pasta called pasta zara number 18 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.869
 I 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.090
 but probably almost 20 years ago 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.580
 conducted many experiments with different 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.500
 firms and that's when I stopped exactly 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.220
 on these pasta since nothing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 other and especially not buy buy 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.960
 yourself a couple of packs of pasta if they see 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.619
 not always on sale unfortunately and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.110
 will be secured for a long time 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.979
 let's get down to the actual 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.840
 cooking pasta even this 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.159
 called cooking pasta but in fact 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.799
 In fact, we will not cook them 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.520
 pour boiling water 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.340
 I do not need to pour a lot of pasta 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.079
 that's where this amount is enough 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 for full day fishing we fill 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.549
 a little boiling water 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.829
 after poured boiling water need 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.189
 be sure to cover the cup with something 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.280
 from above put a plate or saucers and 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.490
 leave in this form for 30-45 seconds 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 seconds then we have pasta 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.700
 Thais are very fast particular time you 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.410
 for two or three times pick yourself 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 it depends on how much you 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.140
 sprinkled with pasta and how hot 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.080
 there was water I prefer to shoot immediately 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.840
 But with the prepared kettle and pour 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.380
 right boiling water and how many conclusions 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.500
 bay 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.500
 that is , somewhere in 30-45 seconds we drain 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:46.710
 the leader will do the boiling water and now 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 pasta should be given a little insistence 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.950
 we close 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260
 cup our further actions such 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.960
 closed the cup with a lid or put it on 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 her saucers and she is worth 10 minutes 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.130
 pasta reach 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.190
 they will take the remaining water 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.010
 swell and reach in 10 minutes 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.430
 cover must be removed and put something 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.440
 so the cup is half covered and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.010
 thus still keep for 10-15 minutes 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.500
 until the top of the pasta starts like this 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.170
 two or three vat they will become more 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.240
 dry and more dense this part 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.070
 we will use macaroni later 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.540
 so-called close - up that is it 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.650
 will be the last one we will 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.620
 hook up 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.680
 they are denser more so solid and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.030
 hold on hook better 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.830
 macaroni is better not to speak than 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.850
 digest because digested by them 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.910
 fishing impossible they fly off the hook 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.980
 reserve 10 minutes have passed 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.890
 pasta swollen slightly under all the water 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.160
 taken away and now we close like this 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.030
 here is half a cup and leave it 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.620
 reach another 10-15 minutes passed 20 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.860
 minutes 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.830
 pasta finally came to the standard 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.960
 the upper part has become a bit 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.060
 dried and tougher and it can 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.680
 use as last 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.620
 macaroni on the hook to all this 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.900
 the design held better 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.930
 now what we have to do is take 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.509
 the capacity in which we will take them 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.639
 with a fishing and pour back here 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.949
 notice i flipped the cup over 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.440
 one crown on and then did not sleep 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.370
 because they have the property of a friend with 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.490
 friend stick together 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.310
 so that they do not stick together and I 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.910
 I recommend after we are now 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.990
 her 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:42.009
 we will perform them in a capacity i recommend them 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.130
 pour a small amount 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:48.490
 sunflower oil and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.030
 use butter like give ravana and 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.340
 so smelly so -called if 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.410
 you can use odorous oil 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.840
 even consider it extra 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.880
 flavoring some anglers 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.000
 what are they doing fall asleep here some 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.910
 flavoring for example put garlic or 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.039
 fall asleep cinnamon 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.680
 In principle, you can do this, I do not 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.020
 why because i have a rich set 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.630
 types I do not know in advance what smell 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.000
 will like fish and I prefer 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.419
 pick up a smell on fishing with 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.620
 dipov with each cast so here I am 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:36.389
 just poured oil so they don't 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.120
 stuck together and surely 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.400
 need to pasta close the lid if 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.150
 you are going fishing right now all 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.699
 ready to take and go if 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.610
 you go fishing the next day 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.190
 or it should be put in a day 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.310
 the refrigerator the refrigerator and they are beautiful 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.680
 persist until fishing on 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.659
 fishing, we also have to keep the jar 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.669
 always closed 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.979
 if you open a can especially in summer 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.280
 the sun pasta is very dry a 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.780
 sound cable repeat basic 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.110
 first moments 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.990
 better pasta don't say digest 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.330
 the second you need to dry them to 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.529
 a layer of pasta formed 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.889
 more solid 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.199
 able to close them 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.779
 softer pasta is also possible 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.179
 do some way of fishing 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.679
 portion of these pasta laid out on the nightingale 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:34.629
 after a while they will 

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:39.609
 stone and will be suitable too for this 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:41.939
 and the third must be kept closed until 

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:46.799
 fishing trips and while fishing 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.799
 all good neither tail nor scales
