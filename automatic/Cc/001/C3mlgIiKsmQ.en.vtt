that<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.199> camera<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:24.050> show<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.080> guys<00:00:25.380> how

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that on camera and show you guys how

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.570 
that on camera and show you guys how
easy<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.810> I'll<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:27.869> take<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:28.980> red

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
easy it is I'll just take this back red

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.400 
easy it is I'll just take this back red
part<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> hand<00:00:30.300> off<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:32.899> as<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.170> see

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
part of the hand off and as you can see

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.220 
part of the hand off and as you can see
the<00:00:35.399> last<00:00:35.670> 30<00:00:36.000> fingers<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.630> separate<00:00:37.079> from

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the last 30 fingers are separate from

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
the last 30 fingers are separate from
the<00:00:37.380> index<00:00:37.680> finger<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.489> connected

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the index finger but they are connected

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
the index finger but they are connected
together<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:41.300> it's<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.350> can

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
together and so it's pretty easy you can

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
together and so it's pretty easy you can
use<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:44.040> exacto<00:00:44.399> knife<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
use an exacto knife if you want I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.770 
use an exacto knife if you want I
actually<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.800> prefer<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.329> regular

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
careful because these are obviously

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.320 
careful because these are obviously
really<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.640> small<00:01:14.939> parts<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:17.150> just<00:01:18.150> make

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
really really small parts so just make

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
really really small parts so just make
sure<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.780> lose<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.470> you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.609 
sure you don't lose them when you're
doing<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:24.350> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doing this and there you go now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.850 
doing this and there you go now
your<00:01:25.830> fingers<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.430> separated<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.650> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
your fingers are separated and you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
your fingers are separated and you can
put<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.720> right<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.500> hand<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.840> want

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
to kind of pay attention to what order
they<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.600> fingers<00:01:37.259> are

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
they go in because the fingers are

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.390 
they go in because the fingers are
different<00:01:37.920> sizes<00:01:38.900> just<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.680> real
