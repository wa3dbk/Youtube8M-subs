and I've put my dial indicator tip right

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.169 
and I've put my dial indicator tip right
on<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.549> top<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.930> quill<00:01:08.640> barrel<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:10.060> I've

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
on the top of the quill barrel what I've

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:12.569 
on the top of the quill barrel what I've
been<00:01:10.539> i've<00:01:11.350> also<00:01:11.530> done<00:01:11.710> though<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.100> moved<00:01:12.340> off

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
been i've also done though is moved off

been i've also done though is moved off
to<00:01:12.609> the<00:01:12.820> side<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.119> little<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.450> know<00:01:13.539> you're

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
to the side a little I know you're

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.510 
to the side a little I know you're
supposed<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.200> have<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.500> on<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> very<00:01:14.890> top<00:01:15.189> but

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
supposed to have it on the very top but

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.810 
supposed to have it on the very top but
I'm<00:01:16.329> getting<00:01:16.689> I<00:01:16.899> would<00:01:16.960> get<00:01:17.280> gyration<00:01:18.280> or

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
I'm getting I would get gyration or

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.630 
I'm getting I would get gyration or
variances<00:01:19.479> in<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.659> reading<00:01:19.960> from<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.640> mark

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
variances in the reading from the mark

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.929

marks<00:01:22.179> of<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:23.039> length<00:01:24.039> on<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.399> quill<00:01:24.609> so<00:01:24.850> I've

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
marks of the length on the quill so I've

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.099 
marks of the length on the quill so I've
moved<00:01:25.119> off<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> side<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.600> don't<00:01:25.840> think<00:01:26.020> that

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
moved off to the side I don't think that

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.499 
moved off to the side I don't think that
should<00:01:26.289> be<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.409> problem<00:01:27.090> zeroed<00:01:28.090> out<00:01:28.240> my

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
should be a problem zeroed out my

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.060 
should be a problem zeroed out my
indicator<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.229> what<00:01:29.320> I'm<00:01:29.409> going<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.679> do<00:01:29.799> now

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
indicator and what I'm going to do now

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.450 
indicator and what I'm going to do now
is<00:01:30.399> just<00:01:30.880> go<00:01:31.450> ahead<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.749> run<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.799> carriage

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
is just go ahead and run the carriage

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.779 
is just go ahead and run the carriage
down<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.700> quill<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.439> this<00:01:38.859> dial

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
down the quill and this this dial

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.459 
down the quill and this this dial
indicator<00:01:40.179> reads<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:40.659> thousands<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.259> an<00:01:41.380> inch

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
indicator reads in thousands of an inch

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.749 
indicator reads in thousands of an inch
ticks<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.939> when<00:01:43.719> I<00:01:43.749> get<00:01:44.079> from<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.009> very

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
ticks and so when I get from the very

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.389 
ticks and so when I get from the very
end<00:01:46.060> out<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.840> front<00:01:47.200> which<00:01:47.530> is<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.710> distance

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
end out to the front which is a distance

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
end out to the front which is a distance
of<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:49.689> I'll<00:01:49.780> measure<00:01:50.020> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.920

the distance of just under two 1/2 about

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.289 
the distance of just under two 1/2 about
two<00:02:02.110> point<00:02:02.350> four<00:02:02.530> five<00:02:02.740> inches<00:02:03.009> was<00:02:03.939> two<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.270> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
two point four five inches was two and a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.790 
two point four five inches was two and a
half<00:02:04.450> inches<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.890> total<00:02:06.580> run<00:02:06.790> out<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.800> about

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
half inches the total run out is about

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.309 
half inches the total run out is about
six<00:02:09.340> thousandths<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:09.970> an<00:02:10.119> inch<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.080> run

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
six thousandths of an inch and that run

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.160 
six thousandths of an inch and that run
out<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.650> directed<00:02:12.459> high<00:02:13.360> as<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.870> see<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.110> I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
out is directed high as you can see if I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.740 
out is directed high as you can see if I
pull<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.730> needle<00:02:15.730> up<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.000> continues<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.630> move

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
pull the needle up it continues to move

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.440 
pull the needle up it continues to move
up<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.550> exaggerated<00:02:18.550> view<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.239> my

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
up so the exaggerated view is that my

up so the exaggerated view is that my
tail<00:02:20.170> stock<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.620> pointed<00:02:21.040> towards<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> sky

laid<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.120> not<00:02:25.420> worry<00:02:25.660> about<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.760> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
laid here and not worry about that that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.090 
laid here and not worry about that that
amount<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.209> run<00:02:28.450> out<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.709> definitely

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
amount to run out but it's definitely

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.590 
amount to run out but it's definitely
something<00:02:30.280> I'll<00:02:30.459> try<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> take<00:02:31.120> into<00:02:31.330> account

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
something I'll try to take into account

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.539 
something I'll try to take into account
when<00:02:31.780> I'm<00:02:31.900> measuring<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:32.950> doing<00:02:33.190> accurate

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
when I'm measuring or doing accurate

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.309 
when I'm measuring or doing accurate
work<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.180> know<00:02:34.269> if<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.720> need<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> shim<00:02:35.290> it

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
work and you know if I need to shim it

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.410 
work and you know if I need to shim it
in<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.530> future<00:02:35.830> all<00:02:35.980> I'll<00:02:36.549> look<00:02:36.670> into<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:36.970> but

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
in the future all I'll look into it but

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.699 
in the future all I'll look into it but
nevertheless<00:02:37.720> certainly<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> good

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
nevertheless certainly a good

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.770 
nevertheless certainly a good
measurement<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.280> run<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.360> finish<00:02:40.510> up

here<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.110> check<00:02:41.350> if<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.680> run<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.600> way

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
here and check if I run it all the way

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:52.340 
here and check if I run it all the way
back<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.590> end<00:02:47.799> up<00:02:47.950> at<00:02:48.100> my<00:02:48.220> starting<00:02:48.819> point

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
a half a sell high so I'm going to go

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.800 
a half a sell high so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.400> run<00:03:00.609> it<00:03:00.640> back<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:04.540> kind<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
ahead and run it back just kind of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.740 
ahead and run it back just kind of
curious<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.170> see<00:03:05.260> how<00:03:05.590> how<00:03:06.130> my<00:03:06.480> marking<00:03:07.480> told

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
curious to see how how my marking told

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.140 
curious to see how how my marking told
okay<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.380> same<00:03:08.590> point<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.940> hair

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
okay the same point there just a hair

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.199 
okay the same point there just a hair
under<00:03:10.180> six<00:03:10.630> out<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.620> running<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
under six out and running it back to the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.860 
under six out and running it back to the
start

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.580 

I<00:03:19.930> got<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:21.150> maybe<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.659> few<00:03:23.379> tenths

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
I got just maybe just a few tenths

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.880 
I got just maybe just a few tenths
higher<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> not<00:03:25.330> really<00:03:25.540> sure<00:03:25.690> why<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.110> sort

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
higher so not really sure why it's sort

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.500 
higher so not really sure why it's sort
of<00:03:26.950> indicating<00:03:27.519> up<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.879> little<00:03:28.090> bit<00:03:28.330> when<00:03:28.480> I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
of indicating up a little bit when I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.869 
of indicating up a little bit when I
returned<00:03:28.870> back<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.319> starting<00:03:29.620> point

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
returned back to the starting point

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.580 
returned back to the starting point
could<00:03:30.879> be<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.150> setup<00:03:31.510> or<00:03:31.750> something<00:03:32.379> that's<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
could be the setup or something that's a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.619 
could be the setup or something that's a
little<00:03:32.830> bit<00:03:32.950> loose<00:03:33.159> in<00:03:33.370> my<00:03:33.489> carriage<00:03:33.909> or<00:03:34.209> you

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
little bit loose in my carriage or you

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.229 
little bit loose in my carriage or you
know<00:03:34.750> could<00:03:34.900> be<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.110> fact<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
know could be the fact that this is a

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.789 
know could be the fact that this is a
relatively<00:03:37.239> expensive<00:03:37.540> dial<00:03:38.110> indicator<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
relatively expensive dial indicator and

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.880 
relatively expensive dial indicator and
there's<00:03:38.950> definitely<00:03:39.250> some<00:03:40.209> weak<00:03:41.019> weak<00:03:41.440> points

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
there's definitely some weak weak points

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.970 
there's definitely some weak weak points
in<00:03:41.950> terms<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.610> flexing<00:03:43.569> such<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.379> arm

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
in terms of the flexing such of the arm

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.069 
in terms of the flexing such of the arm
here<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:45.610> certainly<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.569> think<00:03:46.629> proving<00:03:47.019> the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
here but certainly I think proving the

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.500 
here but certainly I think proving the
point<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.560> we<00:03:48.310> know<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.610> tailstock<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.239> out

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
point that we know the tailstock is out

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.839 
point that we know the tailstock is out
probably<00:03:50.349> about<00:03:50.440> six<00:03:51.040> out<00:03:51.220> high<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:53.579> if<00:03:54.579> need

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
probably about six out high and if need

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.780 
probably about six out high and if need
be<00:03:54.879> like<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.629> consume<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.609> okay<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:57.670> I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
be like you know consume it okay so I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.670 
be like you know consume it okay so I
just<00:03:57.879> measured<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.569> vertical<00:03:59.230> alignment<00:03:59.319> of

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
just measured the vertical alignment of

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.309 
just measured the vertical alignment of
the<00:03:59.799> tailstock<00:04:00.190> with<00:04:00.579> my<00:04:00.790> dial<00:04:01.090> indicator<00:04:01.540> now

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
the tailstock with my dial indicator now

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.020 
the tailstock with my dial indicator now
I'm<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.709> use<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> dial<00:04:03.160> test<00:04:03.519> indicator

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
I'm going to use a dial test indicator

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.740 
I'm going to use a dial test indicator
which<00:04:04.690> I've<00:04:04.870> got<00:04:05.109> mounted<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:05.799> my<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.970> dizzy

for<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:15.220> know<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> boring<00:04:15.819> bar<00:04:16.949> like<00:04:18.120> where

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
for a you know a boring bar like where

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.330 
for a you know a boring bar like where
as<00:04:19.239> an<00:04:19.329> example<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.870> boring<00:04:20.229> bar

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.090 

normally<00:04:26.340> like<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:26.790> boring<00:04:27.000> bar<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.480> such

normally like in a boring bar like such
but<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.400> diocese<00:04:30.300> indicator<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:31.170> I've

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
but the diocese indicator that I've

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.750 
but the diocese indicator that I've
gotten<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.620> think<00:04:31.830> most<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.130> them<00:04:32.250> come<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:32.550> a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
gotten I think most of them come with a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.590 
gotten I think most of them come with a
3/8<00:04:33.570> inch<00:04:34.370> pee<00:04:35.370> hold<00:04:35.730> down<00:04:35.910> piece<00:04:36.150> which<00:04:36.390> works

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
3/8 inch pee hold down piece which works

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.050 
3/8 inch pee hold down piece which works
perfect<00:04:36.990> here<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.190> I'm<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:38.910> is

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
perfect here so I'm going to do here is

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.410 
perfect here so I'm going to do here is

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
is here you'll note I've got it set up a

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.060 
is here you'll note I've got it set up a
little<00:04:53.130> bit<00:04:53.370> just<00:04:53.820> took<00:04:54.470> care<00:04:55.470> when<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> set<00:04:55.980> it

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
little bit just took care when I set it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.280 
little bit just took care when I set it
up<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:57.060> tense<00:04:57.510> but<00:04:57.810> there's<00:04:58.020> still

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
up so that it's tense but there's still

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.890 
up so that it's tense but there's still
a<00:04:58.320> hair<00:04:58.620> amount<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.010> run<00:04:59.190> out<00:04:59.340> God<00:05:00.240> what<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.630> up

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
a hair amount of run out God what is up

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.050 
a hair amount of run out God what is up
you<00:05:01.170> certainly<00:05:01.500> also<00:05:01.620> notice<00:05:02.100> if<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.460> you

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
you certainly also notice if you you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120 
you certainly also notice if you you
know<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.480> if<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:03.930> bump<00:05:04.200> this<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.770> wiggle

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
know if you if you bump this and wiggle

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.530 
know if you if you bump this and wiggle
this<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.370> little<00:05:05.550> bit<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:06.270> know<00:05:06.330> there's<00:05:06.510> a

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
this a little bit you know there's a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.030 
this a little bit you know there's a
couple<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.870> foul<00:05:07.050> play<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.440> that's<00:05:07.770> partly

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
couple of foul play and that's partly

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.100 
couple of foul play and that's partly
because<00:05:08.160> my<00:05:08.670> carriage<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.660> not<00:05:09.810> really

still be able to get I should have
mentioned<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.620> easiest<00:05:26.190> way<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.450> set<00:05:27.450> up

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
mentioned that the easiest way to set up

the dial indicator properly here to be
the<00:05:30.420> dial<00:05:30.630> test<00:05:30.870> indicator<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.710> mount<00:05:32.310> it

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
the dial test indicator is to mount it

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.050 
the dial test indicator is to mount it
with<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.450> compound<00:05:34.520> which<00:05:35.520> I've<00:05:35.670> actually<00:05:35.820> if

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
with the compound which I've actually if

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.820 
with the compound which I've actually if
you<00:05:36.120> note<00:05:36.300> I've<00:05:36.450> got<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.870> parallel<00:05:37.380> with<00:05:37.620> the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
you note I've got in parallel with the

cross feed which and you normally don't
but<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:41.490> know<00:05:41.520> mounted<00:05:42.000> in<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.450> then<00:05:42.570> as

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
but you know mounted in it and then as

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.640 
but you know mounted in it and then as
you<00:05:42.870> rotate<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.850> compound<00:05:44.850> in<00:05:45.590> you'll<00:05:46.590> be

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
you rotate the compound in you'll be

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.200 
you rotate the compound in you'll be
able<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.220> put<00:05:47.670> some<00:05:47.880> tension<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:50.210> dial

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
able to put some tension on the dial

able to put some tension on the dial
test<00:05:51.450> indicator<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:52.140> I've<00:05:52.200> got<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.620> done<00:05:53.220> I'm

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
test indicator so I've got that done I'm

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.900 
test indicator so I've got that done I'm
carefully<00:05:54.420> going<00:05:54.600> to<00:05:54.720> zero<00:05:55.110> out<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:56.520> DPI<00:05:58.910> so

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
carefully going to zero out the DPI so

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.270 
carefully going to zero out the DPI so
I've<00:06:00.000> got<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.210> zeroed<00:06:00.720> I'm<00:06:01.140> at<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.560> sort<00:06:02.220> of

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
I've got a zeroed I'm at the sort of

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.990 
I've got a zeroed I'm at the sort of
beginning<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:03.120> my<00:06:03.830> quill<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.220> tailstock<00:06:05.820> and

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
beginning of my quill the tailstock and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.780 
beginning of my quill the tailstock and
as<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.420> rotate<00:06:06.960> it<00:06:07.020> out

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.110 

now<00:06:12.420> this<00:06:12.600> this<00:06:12.960> reason<00:06:13.530> half<00:06:13.770> out<00:06:14.840> ticks<00:06:15.840> so

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
now this this reason half out ticks so

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:25.970 
now this this reason half out ticks so
get<00:06:18.120> out<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:20.070> end<00:06:22.610> and<00:06:23.610> I'm<00:06:24.180> at<00:06:24.500> five<00:06:25.500> tick

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
get out to the end and I'm at five tick

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.660 
get out to the end and I'm at five tick
so<00:06:26.340> to<00:06:26.400> a<00:06:26.730> half<00:06:27.090> now<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:29.330> that<00:06:30.330> is<00:06:31.520> two<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.640> a

so to a half now and that is two and a

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
half thousands of negative distance so

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.880 
half thousands of negative distance so
to<00:06:36.360> exaggerate<00:06:37.080> at<00:06:37.170> the<00:06:37.260> tailstock<00:06:37.620> is

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
to exaggerate at the tailstock is

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.790 
to exaggerate at the tailstock is
pointing<00:06:38.370> sort<00:06:39.120> of<00:06:39.180> back<00:06:39.330> here<00:06:39.690> or<00:06:39.930> sort<00:06:40.770> of

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
pointing sort of back here or sort of

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.330 
pointing sort of back here or sort of
like<00:06:40.980> like<00:06:41.430> this<00:06:42.200> so<00:06:43.200> if<00:06:43.320> I<00:06:43.440> were<00:06:43.590> to<00:06:43.620> shim<00:06:44.100> it<00:06:44.130> I

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
like like this so if I were to shim it I

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.860 
like like this so if I were to shim it I
would<00:06:44.460> want<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.700> shim<00:06:44.880> it<00:06:44.910> on<00:06:45.120> this<00:06:45.270> side<00:06:45.540> so

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
would want to shim it on this side so

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.410 
would want to shim it on this side so
that<00:06:46.290> it<00:06:46.530> would<00:06:46.650> be<00:06:46.770> pointing<00:06:47.190> more<00:06:47.520> towards

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
that it would be pointing more towards

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.610 
that it would be pointing more towards
the<00:06:48.570> operator<00:06:48.960> here<00:06:49.310> but<00:06:50.310> to<00:06:50.460> an<00:06:50.550> ass<00:06:50.670> Val<00:06:51.000> of

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
the operator here but to an ass Val of

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.440 
the operator here but to an ass Val of
that<00:06:52.620> distance<00:06:53.070> is<00:06:53.310> certainly<00:06:53.910> I<00:06:54.000> think<00:06:54.060> going

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
that distance is certainly I think going

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.590 
that distance is certainly I think going
to<00:06:54.540> prove<00:06:54.810> to<00:06:54.930> be<00:06:54.960> sufficient<00:06:55.950> for<00:06:56.270> my<00:06:57.270> needs

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
to prove to be sufficient for my needs

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.270 
to prove to be sufficient for my needs
as<00:06:58.020> someone<00:06:58.500> pointed<00:06:58.830> out<00:06:58.920> on<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.130> yahoo

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
as someone pointed out on the yahoo

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.930 
as someone pointed out on the yahoo
group<00:06:59.700> you<00:07:00.450> know<00:07:00.570> your<00:07:01.070> drills<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.400> Jacobs

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
group you know your drills and Jacobs

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.340 
group you know your drills and Jacobs
chucks<00:07:03.300> and<00:07:03.540> such<00:07:03.780> you<00:07:04.020> know<00:07:04.050> don't

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
chucks and such you know don't

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.200 
chucks and such you know don't
necessarily<00:07:04.830> hold<00:07:04.980> perfectly<00:07:05.580> true<00:07:05.790> anyways

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
necessarily hold perfectly true anyways

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.880 
necessarily hold perfectly true anyways
so<00:07:06.630> don't<00:07:07.230> need<00:07:07.320> to<00:07:07.440> worry<00:07:07.560> about<00:07:07.650> getting

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
so don't need to worry about getting

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.730 
so don't need to worry about getting
within<00:07:08.310> a<00:07:08.550> few<00:07:08.850> tenths<00:07:08.940> yet<00:07:09.450> a<00:07:09.660> loss<00:07:10.560> of

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
within a few tenths yet a loss of

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.920 
within a few tenths yet a loss of
finding<00:07:11.070> this<00:07:11.130> interesting<00:07:11.550> as<00:07:11.670> I<00:07:11.850> move<00:07:12.660> the

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
finding this interesting as I move the

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.910 
finding this interesting as I move the
DTI<00:07:13.380> back<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:13.830> the<00:07:13.920> start<00:07:14.250> here<00:07:14.460> I'm<00:07:14.640> two<00:07:15.480> ticks

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920 
DTI back to the start here I'm two ticks

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.940 
DTI back to the start here I'm two ticks
off<00:07:16.920> or<00:07:17.430> about<00:07:18.270> a<00:07:18.300> thousand<00:07:18.810> off<00:07:18.960> in<00:07:19.380> my<00:07:19.590> favor

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
off or about a thousand off in my favor

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.980 
off or about a thousand off in my favor
and<00:07:20.460> if<00:07:20.850> I<00:07:20.910> run<00:07:21.090> it<00:07:21.240> back<00:07:21.450> out<00:07:21.750> to<00:07:22.370> the<00:07:23.370> end<00:07:23.990> I'm

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
and if I run it back out to the end I'm

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.650 
and if I run it back out to the end I'm
still<00:07:25.680> at<00:07:26.070> five<00:07:26.460> ticks<00:07:26.850> or<00:07:27.030> two<00:07:27.150> and<00:07:27.300> half<00:07:27.390> now

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
still at five ticks or two and half now

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:34.520 
still at five ticks or two and half now
go<00:07:28.590> back<00:07:28.770> to<00:07:28.890> the<00:07:28.980> beginning<00:07:30.800> and<00:07:31.800> I<00:07:32.520> met<00:07:33.530> one

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.530 
go back to the beginning and I met one

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.740 
go back to the beginning and I met one
two<00:07:35.280> ticks<00:07:35.520> or<00:07:35.670> one<00:07:35.850> tau<00:07:36.030> so<00:07:36.240> maybe<00:07:36.420> the<00:07:36.600> run

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
two ticks or one tau so maybe the run

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.270 
two ticks or one tau so maybe the run
out<00:07:36.900> so<00:07:37.140> even<00:07:37.620> less<00:07:37.800> than<00:07:37.980> two<00:07:38.070> a<00:07:38.100> half

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
out so even less than two a half

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.460 
out so even less than two a half
thousands<00:07:38.790> you<00:07:39.780> know<00:07:39.840> I'm<00:07:39.900> still<00:07:40.080> new<00:07:40.230> to<00:07:40.260> this

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470 
thousands you know I'm still new to this

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.470 
thousands you know I'm still new to this
so<00:07:40.770> we'll<00:07:41.280> probably<00:07:41.520> just<00:07:41.700> continue<00:07:42.240> to<00:07:42.300> take

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480 
so we'll probably just continue to take

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.880 
so we'll probably just continue to take
some<00:07:42.720> measurements<00:07:42.900> over<00:07:43.110> time<00:07:43.230> and<00:07:43.590> see<00:07:43.740> how

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
some measurements over time and see how

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:53.920 
some measurements over time and see how
it<00:07:44.130> pans<00:07:45.000> out<00:07:45.240> thanks<00:07:45.750> ever

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.930 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.990
