out here and from this point i can run
around<00:00:33.110> this<00:00:34.110> island<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.800> there's<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.280> sorts

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
around this island and there's all sorts

around this island and there's all sorts
of<00:00:35.579> different<00:00:35.790> places<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.450> could<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.710> just

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

these puzzles and I'm going to talk

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
these puzzles and I'm going to talk
about<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:16.670> basic<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.799> these<00:01:19.799> panel

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
about the basic way that these panel

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
about the basic way that these panel
puzzles<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> game<00:01:21.090> work<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.950> going

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
puzzles in this game work and I'm going

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130 
puzzles in this game work and I'm going
to<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.430> some<00:01:23.640> relatively<00:01:24.299> simple<00:01:24.750> ones<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to use some relatively simple ones so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
to use some relatively simple ones so
they<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.320> spoil<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.009> too<00:01:26.280> hard<00:01:26.580> these

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
they don't spoil the game too hard these

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.609 
they don't spoil the game too hard these
are<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.479> representative<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> most

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
are not representative of the most

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
are not representative of the most
interesting<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> game<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.119> they

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
interesting things in the game but they

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.469 
interesting things in the game but they
are<00:01:30.390> representative<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> puzzle

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
are representative of the way the puzzle

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.399 
are representative of the way the puzzle
language<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> game<00:01:34.290> works<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:36.200> I've<00:01:37.200> got

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
language in the game works so I've got

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
language in the game works so I've got
this<00:01:37.530> row<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.920> panels<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> only<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> first

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this row of panels and only the first

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.499 
this row of panels and only the first
one<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> turned<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.200> walk<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
one is turned on and I walk up to it and

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
one is turned on and I walk up to it and
I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:43.579> necessarily<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I don't necessarily know what to do I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
I don't necessarily know what to do I
can<00:01:45.540> draw<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> line<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:47.130> draw<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> from<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
can draw a line and I draw it from the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
can draw a line and I draw it from the
circle<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> beginning<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> end<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
circle at the beginning to end and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
circle at the beginning to end and
there's<00:01:49.710> different<00:01:50.159> directions<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.759> draw

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
there's different directions i can draw

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.200 
there's different directions i can draw
the<00:01:50.970> line<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:53.670> didn't<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the line but it didn't like that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
the line but it didn't like that
directly<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> try<00:01:56.520> some

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
directly right so i can i can try some

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
directly right so i can i can try some
things<00:01:56.820> i<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.299> try<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> didn't<00:01:58.380> like

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
things i can try this and it didn't like

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.069 
things i can try this and it didn't like
that<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:59.729> pretty<00:01:59.939> obvious<00:02:00.390> intuitive

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that you're pretty obvious intuitive

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.440 
that you're pretty obvious intuitive
thing<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> try<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.700> puzzle<00:02:03.030> accepts

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
thing to try is that the puzzle accepts

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
thing to try is that the puzzle accepts
that<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> lights<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> next<00:02:04.469> one

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that in lights up the next one

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.160 
that in lights up the next one
you<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:06.159> need<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.549> at<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.210> point<00:02:07.329> have<00:02:08.050> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
you don't need to at this point have a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.930 
you don't need to at this point have a
theory<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.830> head<00:02:09.009> about<00:02:09.039> why<00:02:09.489> that's<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
theory in your head about why that's the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.420 
theory in your head about why that's the
right<00:02:10.090> thing<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:11.980> just<00:02:12.250> start

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
right thing to do but you can just start

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.010 
right thing to do but you can just start
doing<00:02:12.730> more<00:02:12.910> puzzles<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.540> might<00:02:13.690> intuitively

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
doing more puzzles you might intuitively

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.250 
doing more puzzles you might intuitively
do<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.940> get<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.180> right<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:17.080> might

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
do this one and get it right you might

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.559 
do this one and get it right you might
try<00:02:17.620> something<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.360> wrong

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
try something like this and get it wrong

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.320 
try something like this and get it wrong
and<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:20.650> think<00:02:21.040> about<00:02:21.130> why<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.030> was<00:02:22.150> wrong

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
and then think about why that was wrong

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.170 
and then think about why that was wrong
and<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.080> might<00:02:23.560> try<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:25.030> might

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and you might try this and that might

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.059 
and you might try this and that might
also<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.599> right<00:02:25.810> which<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.739> further

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
also be right which is further

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.960 
also be right which is further
information<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:30.310> puzzles<00:02:30.670> are<00:02:30.760> sort

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
information so that the puzzles are sort

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.330 
information so that the puzzles are sort
of<00:02:31.030> neutrally<00:02:31.630> presenting<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:33.280> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
of neutrally presenting you with a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.330 
of neutrally presenting you with a
situation<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.230> letting<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.410> solve<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.130> at

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
situation and letting you solve it at

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.850 
situation and letting you solve it at
first<00:02:36.640> something<00:02:37.540> tremendously<00:02:38.200> simple<00:02:38.650> but

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
first something tremendously simple but

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.830 
first something tremendously simple but
as<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.160> go<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.730> becomes<00:02:40.030> more<00:02:40.180> complex<00:02:40.540> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
as we go on it becomes more complex so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.530 
as we go on it becomes more complex so
here<00:02:41.019> we've<00:02:41.170> added<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.769> third<00:02:42.310> box<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.030> now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
here we've added a third box and now

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.240 
here we've added a third box and now
there's<00:02:43.750> two<00:02:44.019> little<00:02:44.290> black<00:02:44.440> spots<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:45.040> one

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
there's two little black spots in one

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.479 
there's two little black spots in one
white<00:02:45.640> spot<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.269> it's<00:02:46.830> most<00:02:47.830> people<00:02:48.160> at<00:02:48.370> this

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
white spot but it's most people at this

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.000 
white spot but it's most people at this
point<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:48.910> pretty<00:02:49.090> much<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.799> we<00:02:50.799> bring

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
point would pretty much do this we bring

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.630 
point would pretty much do this we bring
it<00:02:51.099> up<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.310> two<00:02:51.489> dimensions<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.890> maybe

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
it up to two dimensions and one maybe

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.729 
it up to two dimensions and one maybe
you<00:02:54.880> randomly<00:02:55.480> flail<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.080> second<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.590> go

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you randomly flail for a second and go

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.110 
you randomly flail for a second and go
like<00:02:56.980> oh<00:02:57.160> let<00:02:57.880> them<00:02:58.060> work<00:02:58.299> but<00:02:59.910> pretty<00:03:00.910> quickly

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
like oh let them work but pretty quickly

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
like oh let them work but pretty quickly
people<00:03:01.390> do<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.349> at<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.500> point<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.830> can

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
people do that so at this point I can

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.530 
people do that so at this point I can
start<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.310> build<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.610> theory<00:03:03.940> about<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.450> I'm

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
start to build a theory about what I'm

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.720 
start to build a theory about what I'm
doing<00:03:04.569> right<00:03:05.500> oh<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:07.019> guess<00:03:08.019> I'm<00:03:08.230> sort<00:03:08.470> of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
doing right oh I guess I'm sort of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.940 
doing right oh I guess I'm sort of
cordoning<00:03:09.730> off<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.840> white<00:03:11.109> spot<00:03:11.440> from<00:03:11.739> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
cordoning off this white spot from the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.699 
cordoning off this white spot from the
black<00:03:12.250> spots<00:03:12.609> or<00:03:12.940> maybe<00:03:13.600> I'm<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.079> separating

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
black spots or maybe I'm just separating

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.410 
black spots or maybe I'm just separating
them<00:03:14.859> or<00:03:15.040> something<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.910> game<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.239> never

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
them or something the game will never

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.990 
them or something the game will never
tell<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.780> right<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.500> have<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.220> tell<00:03:18.549> yourself

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.289 

and<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.440> develop<00:03:24.310> your<00:03:24.340> sense<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:25.030> what<00:03:25.180> these

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
and and develop your sense of what these

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.090 
and and develop your sense of what these
puzzles<00:03:25.690> are<00:03:25.780> asking<00:03:26.049> for<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.069> are

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
puzzles are asking for you so here are

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.090 
puzzles are asking for you so here are
further<00:03:27.430> alarm<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.470> not<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.950> two

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
further alarm now it's not just two

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.979 
further alarm now it's not just two
dimensional<00:03:30.579> but<00:03:30.790> there's<00:03:31.030> multiple<00:03:31.810> white

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
dimensional but there's multiple white

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.030 
dimensional but there's multiple white
spots<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.470> both<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.769> black<00:03:32.980> spots<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
spots in both the black spots so but I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.319 
spots in both the black spots so but I
have<00:03:36.250> an<00:03:36.370> idea<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.639> what<00:03:36.700> I'm<00:03:36.880> doing<00:03:37.120> something

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
have an idea of what I'm doing something

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.210 
have an idea of what I'm doing something
to<00:03:37.450> separate<00:03:37.780> them<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.650> now<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:39.010> wait<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
to separate them and now like wait a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.370 
to separate them and now like wait a
minute<00:03:39.549> isn't<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.810> same<00:03:41.049> thing<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.350> just

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
minute isn't this the same thing I just

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.420 
minute isn't this the same thing I just
did<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.810> actually<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.829> place<00:03:45.010> i<00:03:45.130> need<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.340> go

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
did but actually the place i need to go

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.099 
did but actually the place i need to go
is<00:03:45.579> out<00:03:45.700> here<00:03:46.000> which<00:03:46.600> highlights<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.049> fact

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
is out here which highlights the fact

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.630 
is out here which highlights the fact
that<00:03:47.350> my<00:03:47.530> lions<00:03:47.980> can't<00:03:48.340> pass<00:03:48.579> over<00:03:48.940> itself<00:03:49.269> so

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
that my lions can't pass over itself so

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.790 
that my lions can't pass over itself so
in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.360> in<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.569> process<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.230> presenting<00:03:53.710> this

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
in the in the process of presenting this

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.540 
in the in the process of presenting this
idea<00:03:54.450> about<00:03:55.450> what<00:03:56.319> these<00:03:56.500> spots<00:03:56.920> mean<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.459> how

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
idea about what these spots mean and how

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.960 
idea about what these spots mean and how
you<00:03:57.900> interact<00:03:58.900> with<00:03:59.020> them<00:03:59.170> with<00:03:59.319> your<00:03:59.440> line

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you interact with them with your line

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.220 
you interact with them with your line
there's<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.030> little<00:04:01.180> curveball<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.050> oh

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
there's a little curveball of like oh

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.280 
there's a little curveball of like oh
yeah<00:04:02.440> well<00:04:02.709> actually<00:04:03.660> if<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:04.959> sleepwalk

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
yeah well actually if you just sleepwalk

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.600 
yeah well actually if you just sleepwalk
through<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.890> might<00:04:06.069> not<00:04:06.100> work<00:04:06.280> but

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
through it it might not work but

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.580 
through it it might not work but
actually<00:04:09.610> if<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.760> go<00:04:09.790> around<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.240> way<00:04:10.590> it'll

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
actually if you go around this way it'll

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.730 
actually if you go around this way it'll
work<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:13.600> brings<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.050> idea<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
work so that brings in the idea that the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.590 
work so that brings in the idea that the
direction<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.790> wind<00:04:16.060> around<00:04:16.329> these

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
direction that you wind around these

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.340 
direction that you wind around these
spots<00:04:16.870> actually<00:04:17.290> might<00:04:17.440> matter<00:04:19.079> here<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:20.230> have

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
spots actually might matter here we have

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.310 
spots actually might matter here we have
two<00:04:20.590> disjoint<00:04:20.829> groups<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.579> white<00:04:21.850> spots<00:04:22.540> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
two disjoint groups of white spots and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.040 
two disjoint groups of white spots and
an<00:04:24.100> empty<00:04:24.460> square<00:04:24.910> now<00:04:25.210> which<00:04:25.570> we<00:04:25.810> didn't<00:04:26.020> have

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
an empty square now which we didn't have

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.930 
an empty square now which we didn't have
before<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.010> like<00:04:27.130> Oh<00:04:27.280> what<00:04:27.310> do<00:04:27.550> i<00:04:27.610> do<00:04:27.669> do

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
before and it's like Oh what do i do do

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.430 
before and it's like Oh what do i do do
i<00:04:27.970> include<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.540> with<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> white<00:04:28.900> spot<00:04:29.169> do<00:04:29.410> I

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
i include that with the white spot do I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.950 
i include that with the white spot do I
not<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:30.669> turns<00:04:30.850> out<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> doesn't<00:04:31.300> matter<00:04:31.570> then

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
not it turns out it doesn't matter then

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.100 
not it turns out it doesn't matter then
you<00:04:32.050> can<00:04:32.169> find<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.440> out<00:04:32.680> by<00:04:32.830> experimentation

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
you can find that out by experimentation

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.630 
you can find that out by experimentation
here<00:04:35.110> again<00:04:35.380> we've<00:04:35.560> got<00:04:35.710> two<00:04:35.860> disjoint<00:04:36.070> groups

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
here again we've got two disjoint groups

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.920 
here again we've got two disjoint groups
of<00:04:36.790> white<00:04:36.940> spots<00:04:37.210> but<00:04:37.419> if<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.600> started<00:04:37.870> doing

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
of white spots but if I started doing

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.300 
of white spots but if I started doing
the<00:04:38.080> same<00:04:38.260> thing<00:04:38.470> before<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.800> see<00:04:39.070> that<00:04:39.220> I'm

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
the same thing before I see that I'm

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.159 
the same thing before I see that I'm
cutting<00:04:39.580> off<00:04:39.669> my<00:04:39.700> eggs<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.120> right<00:04:40.330> that's<00:04:41.050> just

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
cutting off my eggs in right that's just

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.470 
cutting off my eggs in right that's just
a<00:04:41.320> reminder<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:42.040> oh<00:04:42.190> yeah<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.610> matters<00:04:42.850> it

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
a reminder like oh yeah it matters it

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.750 
a reminder like oh yeah it matters it
matters<00:04:43.510> which<00:04:43.960> way<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.169> go<00:04:44.550> it's<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.700> to

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
matters which way you go it's going to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.330 
matters which way you go it's going to
go<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.000> way<00:04:46.180> but<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.260> reason<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.710> matters<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
go this way but the reason it matters is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.070 
go this way but the reason it matters is
actually<00:04:48.730> hipper<00:04:49.090> than<00:04:49.240> before<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.750> reason

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
actually hipper than before the reason

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.600 
actually hipper than before the reason
it<00:04:50.169> matters<00:04:50.290> is<00:04:50.680> because<00:04:51.040> there<00:04:51.340> are<00:04:51.430> two

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
it matters is because there are two

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.870 
it matters is because there are two
distinct<00:04:51.970> groups<00:04:52.060> it's<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.510> little<00:04:52.750> bit<00:04:52.870> subtle

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
distinct groups it's a little bit subtle

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.170 
distinct groups it's a little bit subtle
um<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.770> then<00:04:57.130> here<00:04:57.930> well<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.790> can<00:05:00.790> start<00:05:00.970> going

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
um and then here well I can start going

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.400 
um and then here well I can start going
around<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.390> normal<00:05:01.570> way<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:01.810> it's<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.260> oh

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
around the normal way and it's like oh

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.730 
around the normal way and it's like oh
like<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.890> just<00:05:02.950> said<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.280> cutting<00:05:03.940> off<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.270> exit

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
like I just said a cutting off the exit

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.540 
like I just said a cutting off the exit
obviously<00:05:05.740> I'm<00:05:05.860> not<00:05:05.890> gonna<00:05:06.160> be<00:05:06.250> able<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.460> get

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
obviously I'm not gonna be able to get

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.480 
obviously I'm not gonna be able to get
out<00:05:06.700> right<00:05:07.450> well<00:05:07.780> that's<00:05:07.960> not<00:05:08.140> gonna<00:05:08.320> work<00:05:08.490> let

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
out right well that's not gonna work let

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.890 
out right well that's not gonna work let
me<00:05:09.550> try<00:05:09.729> going<00:05:09.880> around<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.150> other<00:05:10.240> way<00:05:10.330> but<00:05:10.750> I

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
me try going around the other way but I

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.980 
me try going around the other way but I
also<00:05:11.190> cut<00:05:12.190> off<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.669> agent<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:15.870> don't<00:05:16.870> know

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
also cut off the agent I don't know

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.209 
also cut off the agent I don't know
what's<00:05:17.890> view

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
what's view

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.439 
what's view
but<00:05:20.219> i'll<00:05:20.310> leave<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.639> solution<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.210> as

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
but i'll leave the solution to that as

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.239 
but i'll leave the solution to that as
an<00:05:21.569> exercise<00:05:21.810> for<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:23.810> but<00:05:24.810> anyway<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:25.159> let<00:05:26.159> me

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
an exercise for the but anyway so let me

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.170 
an exercise for the but anyway so let me
just<00:05:26.819> fly<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.150> camera<00:05:27.539> up<00:05:27.659> for<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.900> second

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
just fly the camera up for a second

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.429 
just fly the camera up for a second
there<00:05:30.180> may<00:05:30.270> be<00:05:30.300> some<00:05:30.599> streaming<00:05:30.870> artifacts

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
there may be some streaming artifacts

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.140 
there may be some streaming artifacts
here<00:05:31.759> but<00:05:33.979> so<00:05:34.979> the<00:05:35.400> puzzles<00:05:35.699> i<00:05:35.789> was<00:05:35.819> doing

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
here but so the puzzles i was doing

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.119 
here but so the puzzles i was doing
we're<00:05:36.270> right<00:05:36.449> down<00:05:36.479> here<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.560> there's<00:05:38.039> an

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
we're right down here and there's an

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.499 
we're right down here and there's an
island<00:05:38.550> full<00:05:38.759> of<00:05:38.819> different<00:05:39.270> themed

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
island full of different themed
