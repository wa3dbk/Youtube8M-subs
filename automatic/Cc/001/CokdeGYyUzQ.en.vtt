so you take this little wooden plank or

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.980 
so you take this little wooden plank or
we<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> wood<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.759> sick<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.600> piston

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
we would think of wood at sick a piston

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.350 
we would think of wood at sick a piston
on<00:02:04.079> top<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> above<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> piston<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
on top of that and above the piston you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.900 
on top of that and above the piston you
build<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.719> two<00:02:07.170> blocks<00:02:07.380> high<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> go

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
build up two blocks high there you go

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.910 
build up two blocks high there you go
and<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.450> top<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> would<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.440> put<00:02:10.649> redstone

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and on top of the would you put redstone

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
and on top of the would you put redstone
dust<00:02:11.340> right<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.790> redstone<00:02:12.629> torch<00:02:12.840> right

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
dust right there redstone torch right

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
dust right there redstone torch right
there<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.500> then

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
there and then

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.290 
there and then
front<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.100> piston<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.880> place<00:02:15.120> another

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
front of the piston you place another

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.110
