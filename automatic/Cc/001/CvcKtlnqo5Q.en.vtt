00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello classmates how are you 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.620
 welcome to this video where we are going to 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.990
 see what they are and how to get the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.180
 trophies of ford filters in game 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 the first of all or in this case the 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.340
 first of this video is not a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.180
 sidecar or a silver trophy very but 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.310
 that very simple to get 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 we will just have to kill a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.090
 enemy from the co-pilot position 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.430
 of the passenger rear position of the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.370
 motorcycles in this case I did this 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.290
 already an unsuspecting enemy engineer 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.530
 he changed my position and I killed him but 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.700
 good there is a persecution a caixa a 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.150
 someone from that position then 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.590
 obviously also going to jump there 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.590
 you have it is not a sidecar 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.900
 another trophy of the five that we have 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.640
 pretty easy in its concept captures the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.810
 flag obviously you already know to what 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.910
 you have to play to get it 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.830
 bronze trophy in any case for me 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.470
 this would be the silver trophy and the other 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.840
 the previous the bronze but good here 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 an enemy fell with the mine we killed 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 this before we go we clean a little 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.880
 more the crime scene where 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.820
 we erase the enemy flag from the map and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.890
 and once we have as we go 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.479
 possible fast to our respawn where 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 We will put the flag and you know what is going 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.240
 this mode and once we do that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.630
 touchdown 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.540
 they give us 500 points for good 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.520
 capture that flag takes a little bit the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.530
 it's true that it's a bit narrow 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500
 this trophy but in the end it's going to end 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.979
 jumping there we have it capture the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 flag 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.160
 the next trophy for me is the one that 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.110
 I liked the transport pilot more 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.300
 what we have to do is 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 with a little birds or with a hub or with 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.370
 a with a beat fern in short with a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.720
 helicopter transporting whatever 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.340
 5 meters even for two seconds 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.110
 transport the bearer of a flag 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.850
 here you have how the Russian flag is put 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.480
 in a little birds the truth is that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.860
 it does not fit very well everything has been said 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.320
 American flag would be enough 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 better and also mercy or flag that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.030
 we have there in our queue and you have 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 silver trophy transport pilot 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.870
 going to the fourth trophy you know that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.520
 we have a drops and where we can after 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 plan with a vehicle and there we have 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.830
 haha launch vehicle hard guy 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.580
 bronze trophy 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.070
 we just have to catch and kill 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.140
 someone with this with this vehicle 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.470
 It does not matter even if you do not throw 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.960
 from above with him if you identify 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 what vehicles has been thrown you get on it and 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.850
 you kill someone although there is always 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.190
 been on the ground we go on the map by 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.220
 here of infantry will also give you 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.720
 the trophy is another trophy of these that you 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.750
 They give a little embarrassed costs out 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.840
 but there you have it, tough guy 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.190
 and to finish using one of the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.010
 new anti - aircraft and anti-tank vehicles 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.350
 Revenge of the anti-aircraft trophy 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.990
 bronze simply what you have to 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.000
 do not kill you can only kill 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.120
 infantry but what you really have 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.120
 what to do is destroy a helicopter or 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.330
 an air vehicle is worth whatever it is 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.710
 a jet a helicopter evidently with 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.230
 the helicopters will be much more 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.810
 easy I recommend you conquer because 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.410
 there are usually two helicopters one of each 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.480
 kind 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.670
 for example on this map where what 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.810
 I got it at riverside so you have 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.630
 quite enough victims to whom 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.440
 you have to try to kill here what are you going 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.970
 watch 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.530
 the missiles come out we break the vehicle and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.820
 after a few seconds we 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.280
 will jump the last trophy of the game are 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.470
 five trophies in total are not very 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720
 complicated but good so you see how the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.049
 I got it I hope that I have served you and 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.950
 see you in the unlocking guide of the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.950
