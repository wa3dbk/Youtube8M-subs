00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.690
 JÃ¼rgen Olbrich 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.290
 Bob Dylan I conclude at all seemed to have almost come an opportunity 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.709
 the pass from Sneijder 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 and he has plenty of room so does the Williams 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.859
 the first gig worth mentioning by Real 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.890
 there was big before 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.740
 But here Schneiders sugar pass on drugs and stylistics all 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.249
 stand 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.659
 well done 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.689
 the 0 2 to 1 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.640
 lucky coincidence 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 the easiest minute again eating a star 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 play for ten 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.710
 the defense against the offender 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.140
 Aigner had been sleeping there 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 the offside on 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 and it's nothing Heinze 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.020
 Now the pilots become guests 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 Segher's bank gets loose 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 as own goal to 1 2 2 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 less beautiful 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.830
 that they will rest with again because this foul Hans Meiser not 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.530
 had been whistled and the branches 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 with this activity, that as Dr 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.030
 red card against di Resta quite defensible so may the captain of the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 do not get carried away 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 what is missing on the court the injury time of the first half 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 Lopez and there comes 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 what would that be 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.429
 National team was 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.429
 many say the best goalkeeper 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.619
 DÃ¶renthe with his eleventh goal of the season 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.619
 We will be in the round that 2 0 2 0 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.599
 Rheine 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.180
 Seers very hard intense first
