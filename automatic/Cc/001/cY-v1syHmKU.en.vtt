00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
doing because they tend to uh they're

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.809 
doing because they tend to uh they're
not<00:01:48.310> meat<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.759> they<00:01:48.850> kind<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.560> melt<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.550> kind

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
not meat so they kind of melt in a kind

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.980 
not meat so they kind of melt in a kind
of<00:01:51.940> way<00:01:52.630> some<00:01:53.380> would<00:01:53.560> even<00:01:53.590> say<00:01:54.720> bubble

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
of way some would even say bubble

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.130 
of way some would even say bubble
it<00:01:56.799> doesn't<00:01:57.220> look<00:01:57.670> completely<00:01:58.000> great<00:01:58.899> if

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
it doesn't look completely great if

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.990 
it doesn't look completely great if
you're<00:01:59.409> used<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.860> regular<00:02:00.310> hot<00:02:00.610> dogs<00:02:00.819> all

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
you're used to just regular hot dogs all

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.050 
you're used to just regular hot dogs all
the<00:02:01.030> time<00:02:01.330> but<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.289> does<00:02:02.440> taste<00:02:02.679> good<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.159> when

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
the time but it does taste good and when

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.940 
the time but it does taste good and when
you<00:02:04.179> consider<00:02:04.390> what<00:02:04.869> are<00:02:04.990> actually<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.500> real

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
you consider what are actually in real

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.449 
you consider what are actually in real
hot<00:02:06.189> dogs<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:07.210> bubbly<00:02:08.019> one<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.829> far<00:02:09.130> better

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
hot dogs a bubbly one is a far better

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.740 
hot dogs a bubbly one is a far better
alternative<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:11.280> they're<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.940> jack<00:02:13.480> cheese

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
alternative so they're the jack cheese

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.300 
alternative so they're the jack cheese
like<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.170> said<00:02:14.350> before<00:02:14.500> Monterey<00:02:15.010> Jack<00:02:15.280> cheese

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
like I said before Monterey Jack cheese

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.910 
like I said before Monterey Jack cheese
from<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.239> wikipedia<00:02:16.810> told<00:02:17.049> me<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
from what wikipedia told me is the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.530 
from what wikipedia told me is the
traditional<00:02:18.430> Jack<00:02:18.640> cheese<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.239> may<00:02:19.359> not<00:02:19.390> be
