00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 well here we have a remote control of 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.350
 the brand and cell the model is x 34 what 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.990
 let's see right now it's like programming 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.910
 today it is previously we already put the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.500
 batteries 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.320
 do the demonstration 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.760
 ok here they are here is the instructive 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.099
 this would be programming by code if 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.010
 we approach it so that they see it well how 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.560
 it is the procedure 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 if this in this case this is used to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.560
 when you have the manual and you have the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.790
 ok codes what we are going right now 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.890
 to teach is programming by search 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 this is very useful for when they do not count 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.879
 with programming manual that is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.879
 where all the codes come 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.270
 read it so they can see how it's done 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.270
 the steps to follow to program it 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 okay 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.450
 in this case good we are going to do the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.659
 practice what we are going to do is first 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.770
 press the prop button that would be that 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.110
 would this be if we are going to program we are going to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.710
 give forgiveness press this button and then 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.740
 we press the four zeros in this 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.200
 case it would be like this we keep it pressed 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.969
 and we put 1 2 3 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 four zeros ok note well that the 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.619
 little bit will stay on that he wants 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.670
 say that you are waiting for that one 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.740
 press the power button we press the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.750
 power button pointing towards the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.970
 television or the good device in this 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.799
 case for television because it 's this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.679
 control nothing else is for pure television 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.580
 but it's already turned off let's do it from 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.240
 new 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.880
 2. 3 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.729
 ok we previously have this on 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.060
 our our television and we press 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.269
 this button what are we going to do with this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.740
 procedure is to go through the codes 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.260
 that come in the manual 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.380
 and the remote control but in this case it's 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.740
 to be without the code and then this one is going to 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.819
 go through the codes that you have 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.520
 stored 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.730
 and we will arrive at the moment until what 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.370
 and turn off the television equipment that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.700
 we're wanting program if we're going to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 suppose 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.650
 with the latter the television was turned off 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.720
 then after that we're going to 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.680
 press the enter button 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.140
 Check how the little bit blinks 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.330
 three times that means you 're already 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.330
 the procedure was finished 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.819
 basically it's all that's the way it is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.989
 very simple to do programming 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.160
 in this universal remote control of the isr 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.160
 x 34
