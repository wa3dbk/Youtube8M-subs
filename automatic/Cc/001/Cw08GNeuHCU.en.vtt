friction there are remaining sections

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.550 
friction there are remaining sections
and<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.750> I'm<00:04:11.810> having<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.230> opposite

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
and so I'm having in the opposite

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.839 
and so I'm having in the opposite
direction<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.010> wrap<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.549> same

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
direction you wrap it in the same

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.750 
direction you wrap it in the same
direction<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.629> wrap<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> other<00:04:14.930> one<00:04:15.760> so

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
direction that you wrap the other one so

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:26.409 
direction that you wrap the other one so
it<00:04:16.789> makes<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.269> really<00:04:19.150> nice

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.309 

oh<00:04:28.509> okay<00:04:29.509> it<00:04:29.659> might<00:04:29.749> be<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.930> little<00:04:30.080> sloppy

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
oh okay it might be a little sloppy

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.510
