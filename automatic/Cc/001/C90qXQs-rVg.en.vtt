00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.799
 we had mobile bars like these are there 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.879
 a development of bars from the beginning 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:17.360
 three years ago and we have always been with 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:21.650
 the idea is to bring the pisco in 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.110
 formats are not different from the client 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.000
 then we made a bar is this 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:32.300
 first bar that was 2009 mix 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.020
 So when you walk along the boardwalk 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 but there are bars like these from caipirinha 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.880
 every 100 meters 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.220
 and a pisco bar in as well as as 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.290
 as well as there are bars of caipirinha river of 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.600
 janeiro that receives millions of tourists 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.550
 a year is interesting because not one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.560
 bar of this kind of pisco sour if 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 you are the same in all lime there is no 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.380
 then this is because it does not give them 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.900
 license 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.400
 Of course, because there are no licenses because 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.829
 the subject still with the peak is a bit 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.619
 as well as how complicated the subject is 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.570
 sell liquor on the street the subject of giving 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.380
 cocktail is a culture still very 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.909
 still rooted here then yes then 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.310
 there is not the custom not the people who 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.710
 take is suck and fit charles and not 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.180
 stop then the idea of the company is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.000
 just give that possibility to the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.580
 people that people enjoy in cocktail and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.299
 the company very pulp hotels with 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.640
 Pisco then is a cocktail that tries to 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.710
 entertain of having fun make you the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 pleasant time but not to get drunk and 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.979
 little by little we have tried to go 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.840
 advancing on the line is to take out 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.110
 bars and then we have gone from these 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.200
 mobile bars there is to this concept a 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.299
 little more elaborate than this is a one 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.500
 combi not a combi bar and has a whole 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.929
 adventure behind that is the adventure 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.259
 Pisco World The World Adventure 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.720
 of pisco means that means that a 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.420
 starting this year we want to launch this 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.610
 unit is combi that was and that starts 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.700
 to have followers not of people who 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.680
 feel part of this adventure 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.800
 lacombe and the following year I traveled by 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.690
 places of Peru carrying this proposal 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.190
 to share the pisco with everyone in a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.500
 cocktail and 2014 to ride on a trip 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.290
 until Brazil to make elvis with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.340
 offering to this world holiday that is 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 Brazil 2014 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.870
 the adventure is that epic oil trip no 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.660
 It would be nice to arrive our selection 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.709
 It would be nice but if they also accompany me 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.709
 on the disk would be the most 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.620
 It is a small bar 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.720
 I have a small meeting in my 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.220
 house and they take this bar with a 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.680
 barman who prepares cocktails with 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.930
 Pisco is like that and this is the one I ate 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.950
 process and this got stung 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.960
 and this is the bartender 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.390
 what are you calling my ills 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.750
 ah, well, it's reading the change 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.750
 national 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.060
 yes 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.210
 for this same as it 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:43.930
 it could be a file if ballack or pencil 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.930
 with the combi to rio janeiro 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.420
 of course we can add people forward 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.600
 opening the way back comes the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 ceviches the cholita they are making 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 this already to finish the coffee 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.600
 attraction to the four stadiums to the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.600
 general fairs 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.730
 this classic of the brand that is hellboy 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.830
 it's called like that because we wanted that 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.739
 we started a company had names 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.739
 associated with youth culture is a 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.070
 red character of strawberry pulp juice 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.070
 orange 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.470
 it is not this 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.570
 are two classes with you we have first 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.570
 taken to many events 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.290
 it's great 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.250
 very good 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.629
 and that's a calculation how much it would cost 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.370
 hours after having already investigated 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.349
 developed everything I will make a 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.449
 second peak and how much it would cost more about 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.729
 the some types between about 8 thousand and 10 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.270
 thousand eight thousand dollars for closing one 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.460
 second unit also includes the purchase 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.870
 makridis mil or that a person can 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.850
 have your own company 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.650
 turn into food and records for eight 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.650
 thousand dollars specifically 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:31.130
 somewhere if I got a normal time 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.470

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.210
 future as you say with several combis and

 you can milk meals was a 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.760
 it could also be the anticucho combi 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.860
 we could do because it opens then 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.150
 because you no longer have the smoke of what 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.620
 different others combine food that has 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.120
 the raised ceiling that you see in the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.010
 street is turning a couple of 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.920
 pistons that allow the roof open 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.260
 almost 90 degrees and hearing problem the 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.650
