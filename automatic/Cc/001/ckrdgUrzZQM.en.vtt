hello<00:00:01.079> welcome<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.890> delta<00:00:02.580> explanation

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello welcome to my delta explanation

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.510 
hello welcome to my delta explanation
tutorial<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.110> I'm<00:00:04.650> gonna<00:00:04.799> try<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.190> explain

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
tutorial and I'm gonna try and explain

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.210 
tutorial and I'm gonna try and explain
to<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.960> what<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.109> Delta<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.069> works

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
to you what is Delta and how it works

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.310 
to you what is Delta and how it works
now<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> lot<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.880> people<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.540> already<00:00:09.809> made

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
now a lot of people have already made

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.690 
now a lot of people have already made
such<00:00:10.860> tutorials<00:00:11.570> but<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:14.040> explanation<00:00:14.309> given

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
such tutorials but the explanation given

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.849 
such tutorials but the explanation given
is<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:16.970> extremely<00:00:17.970> basic<00:00:18.439> compared<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.650> what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
is is extremely basic compared to what

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.640 
is is extremely basic compared to what
you're<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> use<00:00:20.520> Delta<00:00:20.939> work<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> what

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you're going to use Delta work so what

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.140 
you're going to use Delta work so what
is<00:00:22.740> Delta<00:00:23.539> Delta<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.369> how<00:00:26.760> fast

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is Delta Delta is basically the how fast

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
is Delta Delta is basically the how fast
the<00:00:27.570> valley<00:00:27.810> changes<00:00:29.420> /<00:00:30.420> gmod<00:00:31.320> time<00:00:31.619> point

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the valley changes / gmod time point

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
the valley changes / gmod time point
which<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.630> 0.1<00:00:34.290> seconds<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.350> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
which as I think 0.1 seconds but it can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100 
which as I think 0.1 seconds but it can
also<00:00:37.760> understand<00:00:38.760> whether<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.629> you're

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
also understand whether you're you're

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.930 
also understand whether you're you're
going<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:42.200> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.149> value<00:00:45.149> range<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
going up or down in the value range so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
going up or down in the value range so
if<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.840> zero<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.070> metal

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
if I go this is zero which is the metal

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
if I go this is zero which is the metal
and<00:00:51.110> if<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:53.329> towards<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> negative

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and if I go up towards the negative

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
and if I go up towards the negative
towards<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> positive<00:00:56.190> value<00:00:56.760> range<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
towards the positive value range the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
towards the positive value range the
Delta<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.469> positive<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.699> move

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
Delta is going to be positive if I move

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.439 
Delta is going to be positive if I move
this<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.949> I'm<00:01:01.949> moving<00:01:02.309> towards<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> negative

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
this way I'm moving towards the negative

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
this way I'm moving towards the negative
value<00:01:03.930> range<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> Delta<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
value range so the Delta is going to be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.380 
value range so the Delta is going to be
negative<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:08.720> quite<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> better<00:01:10.020> example<00:01:11.390> what

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
negative so quite a better example what

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.039 
negative so quite a better example what
is<00:01:12.510> Delta<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.229> works<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:15.780> I've

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
is Delta had it works is this now I've

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
is Delta had it works is this now I've
got<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> plate<00:01:16.590> I've<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> target<00:01:17.280> finder

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
got a plate I've got a target finder

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.620 
got a plate I've got a target finder
which<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.860> having<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> target<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:21.180> Delta

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
which is having me as a target my Delta

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
which is having me as a target my Delta
chip<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:23.130> beacon<00:01:23.490> sensor<00:01:24.470> now<00:01:25.470> beacon

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
chip and my beacon sensor now beacon

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.480 
chip and my beacon sensor now beacon
sensor<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> outputting<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.330> bearing<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:29.340> my

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
sensor is outputting the bearing to my

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719 
sensor is outputting the bearing to my
screen<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.729> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
screen which is this one here and the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
screen which is this one here and the
Delta<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.210> connected<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> Delta<00:01:34.350> over

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Delta is connected to the Delta over

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.630 
Delta is connected to the Delta over
here<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.659> too<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.100> case<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.460> don't

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
here so just too just in case you don't

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.620 
here so just too just in case you don't
know<00:01:39.799> what<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.829> bearing<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.299> bearing<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
know what the bearing is the bearing is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.770 
know what the bearing is the bearing is
basically<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.939> angle<00:01:45.360> between<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
basically the angle between me and the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.910 
basically the angle between me and the
axes<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:51.000> beacon<00:01:51.930> sensor<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.560> looking

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
axes that the beacon sensor is looking

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.720 
axes that the beacon sensor is looking
at<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.450> angle<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.680> here

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
at so it's this angle right here

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.470 
at so it's this angle right here
so<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.620> when<00:02:01.980> i'm<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:03.330> the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
so you can see that when i'm here at the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.470 
so you can see that when i'm here at the
left<00:02:03.690> side<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.650> bearing<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.010> positive<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
left side the bearing is positive and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.720 
left side the bearing is positive and
when<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.350> negative<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
when I'm here it's negative so this is a

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.670 
when I'm here it's negative so this is a
negative<00:02:08.970> value<00:02:09.270> range<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
negative value range this is the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.190 
negative value range this is the
positive<00:02:11.100> value<00:02:11.220> range<00:02:11.550> now<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.930> see

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
positive value range now you can see

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.380 
positive value range now you can see
that<00:02:13.230> whenever<00:02:14.070> when<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> move<00:02:14.880> towards<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that whenever when I move towards the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.970 
that whenever when I move towards the
negative<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> Delta<00:02:17.310> goes<00:02:17.520> up<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.560> it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
negative the Delta goes up but it's it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500 
negative the Delta goes up but it's it's
going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.520> negative<00:02:20.760> because<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
going to be negative because it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.820 
going to be negative because it
understands<00:02:21.990> i'm<00:02:22.140> moving<00:02:22.380> towards<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
understands i'm moving towards a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.630 
understands i'm moving towards a
negative<00:02:23.190> value<00:02:23.940> range<00:02:24.440> when<00:02:25.440> i<00:02:25.470> move<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.890> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
negative value range when i move up it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.080 
negative value range when i move up it's
still<00:02:26.850> going<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:28.430> bad<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.610> still<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
still going to be bad is still going to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.700 
still going to be bad is still going to
change<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.410> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> change

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
change but it's going to change

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.030 
change but it's going to change
positively<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.600> positively<00:02:34.080> because<00:02:34.890> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
positively up and positively because it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220
