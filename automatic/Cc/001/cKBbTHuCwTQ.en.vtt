interrupts<00:00:01.680> or<00:00:01.829> not<00:00:02.159> analog<00:00:02.399> comm<00:00:02.820> today<00:00:03.480> I'm

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
interrupts or not analog comm today I'm

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.720 
interrupts or not analog comm today I'm
looking<00:00:03.659> at<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.049> Plantronics<00:00:04.770> backbeat<00:00:05.460> go

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
looking at the Plantronics backbeat go

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.179 
looking at the Plantronics backbeat go
to<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.960> have<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.470> past<00:00:07.649> reviewed<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
to now I have in the past reviewed the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.040 
to now I have in the past reviewed the
backbeat<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.630> found<00:00:09.780> them<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:09.990> very

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
backbeat one and I found them to be very

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.959 
backbeat one and I found them to be very
good<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.559> terms<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.950> audio<00:00:11.219> quality<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
good in terms of audio quality but the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.759 
good in terms of audio quality but the
biggest<00:00:12.150> problem<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.719> they<00:00:12.960> always<00:00:13.170> fell<00:00:13.530> out

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
biggest problem was they always fell out

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.550 
biggest problem was they always fell out
because<00:00:14.009> they<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.700> mostly<00:00:15.360> buds<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:16.109> they

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
because they are mostly buds now they

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.050 
because they are mostly buds now they
have<00:00:16.740> fixed<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> model<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
have fixed that in this model and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.269 
have fixed that in this model and
obviously<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> past<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:19.859> actually<00:00:20.039> been

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
obviously in the past I've actually been

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
obviously in the past I've actually been
using<00:00:20.520> these<00:00:20.730> Jabra<00:00:21.300> sports<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:22.199> when

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
using these Jabra sports because when

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.870 
using these Jabra sports because when
I'm<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:23.070> running<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.460> things<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.760> that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I'm going running in things like that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.730 
I'm going running in things like that
you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.689> hook<00:00:24.930> around<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> ear<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you can see they hook around the ear and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.259 
you can see they hook around the ear and
they<00:00:25.920> provide<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> bit<00:00:26.609> more<00:00:26.640> stability

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they provide a bit more stability

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
they provide a bit more stability
without<00:00:27.539> dropping<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:29.010> Plantronics

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
without dropping off so Plantronics

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
without dropping off so Plantronics
always<00:00:29.699> took<00:00:29.939> note<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> those<00:00:30.510> things<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
always took note of those things and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.200 
always took note of those things and
they've<00:00:31.470> updated<00:00:31.679> them<00:00:32.219> they've<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.000> put

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
they've updated them they've now put

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.450 
they've updated them they've now put
these<00:00:33.390> stabilizers<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> inside<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> them

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
these stabilizers on the inside of them

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
these stabilizers on the inside of them
which<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.239> sit<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:37.050> inside<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
which actually sit more inside the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639 
which actually sit more inside the
actual<00:00:38.100> ear<00:00:38.579> rim<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.930> creates<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> huge

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
actual ear rim and that creates a huge

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
actual ear rim and that creates a huge
amount<00:00:40.770> more<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.340> stability<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:42.030> before

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
amount more of stability because before

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.580 
amount more of stability because before
it<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.660> budge<00:00:42.840> sitting<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.350> hole

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it was just a budge sitting in your hole

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
it was just a budge sitting in your hole
and<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.340> would<00:00:44.430> easily<00:00:44.610> fallen<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and it would easily fallen out and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
and it would easily fallen out and
things<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.739> weigh<00:00:46.860> 14<00:00:47.399> grams<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
things like that they weigh 14 grams so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
things like that they weigh 14 grams so
they<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.480> absolutely<00:00:48.780> light<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> feather

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they are absolutely light as a feather

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.510 
they are absolutely light as a feather
now<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.600> come<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.710> really

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now they also come with this really

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
now they also come with this really
really<00:00:53.640> genius<00:00:53.940> case<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.289> no<00:00:55.440> case

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
really genius case now there is no case

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
really genius case now there is no case
I've<00:00:55.890> seen<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.489> before<00:00:56.879> especially<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I've seen like this before especially in

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
I've seen like this before especially in
the<00:00:57.449> headphone<00:00:57.780> range<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the headphone range and what it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069 
the headphone range and what it
basically<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.730> yes<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> simple<00:01:00.750> carrier

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
basically is yes it's a simple carrier

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.510 
basically is yes it's a simple carrier
pouch<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.680> also<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> built-in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pouch but it's also going to built-in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.050 
pouch but it's also going to built-in
battery<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> battery<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.530> fully<00:01:04.920> charge

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
battery now the battery can fully charge

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.160 
battery now the battery can fully charge
the<00:01:06.060> backbeat<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.780> twos<00:01:07.700> twice<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.780> single

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the backbeat go twos twice on a single

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.969 
the backbeat go twos twice on a single
charge<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:11.970> charge<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> headphones

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
will ended up on like this and that

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.430 
will ended up on like this and that
creates<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.209> lot<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.359> imbalance<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.109> use<00:04:05.260> of

the previous model as well you just have
to<00:04:10.870> put<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.109> remote<00:04:11.319> somewhere<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.889> can't

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
to put the remote somewhere you can't

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.550 
to put the remote somewhere you can't
have<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.879> nowhere<00:04:13.109> but<00:04:14.109> when<00:04:14.199> you<00:04:14.260> do<00:04:14.349> put<00:04:14.500> it

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
have it nowhere but when you do put it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
on one side you're creating an uneven

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.009 
on one side you're creating an uneven
weight<00:04:16.329> distribution

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
weight distribution

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.750 
weight distribution
it<00:04:17.169> sounds<00:04:17.829> creative<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.340> true<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.700> you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
it sounds creative it's true and you

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.580 
it sounds creative it's true and you
notice<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.630> when<00:04:19.780> you're<00:04:19.900> running<00:04:20.079> going

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.290 
notice it so when you're running going
back<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.919> forth<00:04:21.159> eventually<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.030> end<00:04:22.060> up

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
back and forth eventually you end up

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.460
