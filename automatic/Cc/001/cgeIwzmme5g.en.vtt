00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.179
 throughout life as the diagram that explain what a human being is 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.989
 what is the universe of the relationship between 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.259
 the human being and the universe we already know what the lawyer ed is a diagram 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.250
 universal and everything that is reflected 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.490
 here in this symbolism 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.110
 creation system 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.060
 so there's nothing we can think of that is not represented here 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.480
 no small grandchild grand spirit there is nothing in the human being 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.210
 that is not represented here there is nothing in the creation of the universes 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.360
 the worlds the galaxies of the past present and future that is not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.590
 represented here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.160
 It is a universal diagram 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.270
 and this has been created by teachers of wisdom and is so well done that it does not 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 incorporates everything 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.210
 It has different levels of interpretation 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.640
 and it is also considered that inside each impular montero sphere so 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.700
 we can 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 this has robbed him and made it very complex so study it from a point of 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.580
 view assis 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.750
 but enough i also very complete itself 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 as we have it afa hours 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.080
 we are making a look follow the bird's eye style of the spheres 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 of the tree and its relationship 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 and like those spheres that is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.880
 which in Hebrew is called the stretched and populated style like those spheres 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.860
 explain our composition 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.640
 How are we created? How do we work? What are our levels? 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.810
 we have seen in general terms that these spheres down here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.890
 it represented personality this his physical body of the level of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.080
 the excess emotions the mental plane and from here up this triangle is 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 a spiritual level or and the triangles bring down those divine level 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.810
 all this is part of our nature is the description of what 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.059
 it is a true human being the human being 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.109
 in his unfoldment he first realizes that he has a body and he does 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.249
 grow an emotional level finally the mental level then discovered the 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.269
 he branded the iraq he finally discovers that he is a divine being that I will be incarnate 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.489
 on the face of the earth and with all of this they develop the capabilities 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.219
 teachers of wisdom ane have explained
