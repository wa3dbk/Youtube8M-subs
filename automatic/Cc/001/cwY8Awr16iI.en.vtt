00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
thesis project we don't have enough room

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.490 
thesis project we don't have enough room
for<00:00:46.060> all<00:00:46.090> their<00:00:46.390> thesis<00:00:46.810> but<00:00:46.990> it's<00:00:47.170> part<00:00:47.440> of

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
for all their thesis but it's part of

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.170 
for all their thesis but it's part of
the<00:00:47.590> thesis<00:00:47.980> project<00:00:48.400> just<00:00:49.000> on

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
the thesis project just on

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.960 
the thesis project just on
sustainability<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.040> focus<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.520> on<00:00:51.670> kind

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
sustainability when the focus is on kind

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.440 
sustainability when the focus is on kind
of<00:00:52.060> phenomenology<00:00:53.700> another<00:00:54.700> one<00:00:54.850> like<00:00:55.060> social

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
of phenomenology another one like social

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.610 
of phenomenology another one like social
responsibility<00:00:56.080> so<00:00:56.170> there's<00:00:56.440> different

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
responsibility so there's different

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.940 
responsibility so there's different
themes<00:00:57.130> that<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.610> students<00:00:58.000> go<00:00:58.150> into<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.770> if

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
themes that the students go into but if

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.530 
themes that the students go into but if
you<00:01:00.070> look<00:01:00.250> at<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.490> we're<00:01:00.670> all<00:01:00.820> all<00:01:01.150> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
you look at it we're all all the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.630 
you look at it we're all all the
projects<00:01:02.050> are<00:01:02.290> probably<00:01:03.130> what<00:01:03.310> we<00:01:03.400> call

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
projects are probably what we call

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.760 
projects are probably what we call
conceptual<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:05.199> fact<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:05.560> they're

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
conceptual and the fact that they're

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.410 
conceptual and the fact that they're
really<00:01:05.979> concepts<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.700> ideas<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.330> they<00:01:07.480> have

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
really concepts of ideas that they have

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:18.500 
really concepts of ideas that they have
architecture

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.469 

this<00:01:19.510> is<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.780> year-long<00:01:20.530> thesis<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:22.180> that

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
this is a year-long thesis and so that

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.499 
this is a year-long thesis and so that
means<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:23.470> use<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.830> Fall<00:01:24.100> Quarter<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.210> do

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
means we use the Fall Quarter to do

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.660 
means we use the Fall Quarter to do
research<00:01:25.750> ordinary<00:01:26.590> research<00:01:27.040> on<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.400> site

research and implementing it into
natural<00:01:53.289> project<00:01:53.979> we<00:01:54.520> do<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:55.000> 50<00:01:55.659> or<00:01:55.750> thesis

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
natural project we do this 50 or thesis

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.770 
natural project we do this 50 or thesis
is<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.350> way<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.619> establish<00:01:57.369> like<00:01:57.580> what<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.569> want

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
is a way to establish like what you want

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.870 
is a way to establish like what you want
to<00:01:58.869> do<00:01:59.020> later<00:01:59.319> in<00:01:59.560> life<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.100> well<00:02:00.729> not

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
to do later in life and well not

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240 
to do later in life and well not
necessarily<00:02:01.030> but<00:02:01.720> usually<00:02:02.319> like<00:02:02.920> what<00:02:03.100> your

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
necessarily but usually like what your

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.190 
necessarily but usually like what your
interests<00:02:03.700> are<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.119> then<00:02:04.330> implement<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.960> so

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
interests are and then implement that so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200 
interests are and then implement that so
people<00:02:05.470> can<00:02:05.800> go<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.280> grad<00:02:06.640> school<00:02:07.000> and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
people can go on to grad school and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.050 
people can go on to grad school and
still<00:02:07.450> pursue<00:02:07.899> these<00:02:08.259> kind<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:08.800> topics<00:02:09.250> or<00:02:09.459> go

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
still pursue these kind of topics or go

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.699 
still pursue these kind of topics or go
into<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.450> professional<00:02:10.959> environment<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
into the professional environment and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.130 
into the professional environment and
you<00:02:12.430> know<00:02:12.519> implement<00:02:13.030> these<00:02:13.120> theories<00:02:13.959> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
you know implement these theories that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530 
you know implement these theories that
may<00:02:14.290> seem<00:02:14.350> out<00:02:14.680> loud<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.220> outlandish<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.269> first

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
may seem out loud at outlandish at first

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.479 
may seem out loud at outlandish at first
but<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.200> 20<00:02:17.530> years<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.950> know<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.190> lot<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
but like in 20 years you know a lot of

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.520 
but like in 20 years you know a lot of
these<00:02:18.549> products<00:02:19.030> may<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.569> reality<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.350> an

these products may be a reality it is an

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.470 
these products may be a reality it is an
enormous<00:02:21.430> amount<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.790> work<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.970> fun

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
enormous amount of work it's it is fun
