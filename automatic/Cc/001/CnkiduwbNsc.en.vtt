00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.270
 hello today i will show how 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.280
 cook hercules for fishing 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.139
 ways a great many like him 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.809
 to cook 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.210
 Today I will show the simplest so 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.869
 take 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.400
 Hercules how much quantity is needed 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:32.480
 pour it in some strainer alive 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:41.480
 and boiling water for eight ten 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:46.360
 seconds pour it wait until fully 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.360
 boiling water and water will drain 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.780
 Now 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.019
 cold water lapped his wash combo 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 everything now remains hercules lay out on 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:13.220
 newspaper so that he dried up so lay out 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:19.670
 and level 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.670
 just level with a fork 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 ten minutes later when one side 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 more or less dry 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.830
 let 's prevent him from drying out 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:42.350
 the other side is all 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:46.909
 and here in this state we leave it 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 as for flavoring it or not 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.369
 in principle, the hercules on from is so good myself 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.780
 by oneself 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.970
 no added flavors are not necessary 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.390
 only and sometimes add a little bit 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.450
 garlic 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.569
 as I do with garlic 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.770
 very easy chisel take a clove 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:21.560
 garlic wrapped some rag 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.560
 in small she just crush him 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:39.350
 You can tighten rezinochki and here in this 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:43.880
 condition right in a rag put this 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:49.090
 garlic in a container with hercules so with 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:52.780
 one side hercules dried up a little 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.310
 Soaps or put on a new newspaper 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.760
 but dry to speed it up 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.760
 this process 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:12.460
 here and again we level out thin 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.460
 layer with a fork 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.440
 Hercules have more or less dried up 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.760
 now what we do is take a little 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.790
 breadcrumbs 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.250
 pour out into the tank where we will 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.980
 stored why are we doing this first 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:39.910
 crackers will absorb excess moisture if it 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:47.360
 left in the second will give hercules 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:50.870
 bread aroma third these here 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.980
 pieces of crackers when Push and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.740
 throw bait on 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.880
 will be gradually separated from the hercules 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:10.120
 and attract fish so poured out 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:16.780
 Hercules closed the jar 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 with chat it all mixed up and here 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.820
 add our prepared garlic 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.120
 rags 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.130
 tied up with thread with twine so that he wouldn't 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.260
 never got enough sleep 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.889
 straight here all tightly close the jar yet 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.910
 chatted up mixed our nozzle 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.240
 ready hope this advice he was something 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.300
 useful and interesting all the best 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.300
