00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.700
 this fad of diets and libraries 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.490
 It's always worth talking 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.830
 a little about it in a practical way 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.830
 telling you we can remember 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.110
 which is converted earlier than 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 Protein and fat carbohydrate are the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.260
 elements that make people and energy 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.580
 now the protein has a component 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.470
 that we talked about 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.410
 about proteins that is nitrogen 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.510
 that happens every time you increase the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.489
 your protein intake an amount 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 bigger than your body needs people 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.159
 There is no way to play. 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 this protein 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.290
 then this protein destroyed then the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.659
 protein is converted to carbohydrate and 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.879
 becomes fat and as the 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.800
 this protein has nitrogen cover 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 tribune has no subway genius that today does not 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.589
 It has to be done with it we have 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.699
 to throw it out 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.650
 then entered the blood today if 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.970
 make ammonia a substance 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.590
 quite toxic 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.780
 only fish can see with ammonia 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 because they are decreasing this substance 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 in the water and end up being played for them but 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 we humans can not have the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.670
 woman in the blood is highly toxic 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 to the central nervous system 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 So what do we do like this? 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.469
 Nitrogen This Woman The Liver The Liver 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 transforms this morning in urea and this 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.759
 idea is taken to the kidneys and people 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 play through the urine 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 so the excess protein you go 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.630
 simply pick up this noble nutrient 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.579
 and will turn into carbohydrate and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.119
 fat and will not bring an overload 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.189
 bigger for liver and for me the question is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 it hurts this excess 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.359
 at first we do not have many studies 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 demonstrating that this can really 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.869
 be a great damage 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 although we know that the demand for 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.259
 working with the liver and pushing is greater 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.520
 then people with liver problems 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.560
 renal 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.090
 we really take great care in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 calculate the amount of protein in the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.929
 diet in healthy individuals is difficult 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.689
 determine how much this really will 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.190
 be possible but in practical terms not 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.470
 it is also very smart to use this 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.000
 excess because this excess will turn 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.310
 simply fat carbohydrate then it is 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.770
 easier to reduce the amount of 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.540
 Protect yourself and allow yourself with a little 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.130
 more carbohydrate and fat because this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.730
 balance will be much more optimized 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730
 thus
