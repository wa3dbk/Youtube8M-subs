Judy who's one of our treadmill trainer

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.459 
Judy who's one of our treadmill trainer
clients<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> she<00:00:12.809> wants<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.230> about

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
clients and she wants to know about

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
clients and she wants to know about
training<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.250> half<00:00:14.309> marathon<00:00:14.540> in<00:00:15.540> which

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
training for a half marathon in which

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.450 
training for a half marathon in which
there<00:00:15.990> will<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.170> rolling<00:00:16.500> hills

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
there will be rolling hills

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.859 
there will be rolling hills
I<00:00:17.490> believe<00:00:17.970> she's<00:00:18.150> currently<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.539> eight<00:00:18.660> point

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I believe she's currently at eight point

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.170 
I believe she's currently at eight point
three<00:00:18.930> miles<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.609> she<00:00:20.699> has<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
three miles and so she has a bit of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.550 
three miles and so she has a bit of
distance<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> cover<00:00:21.750> still<00:00:22.170> because<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> half

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
distance to cover still because a half

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
distance to cover still because a half
marathon<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:23.910> than<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
marathon is a little bit more than that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.019 
marathon is a little bit more than that
and<00:00:24.420> she<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:25.289> wants<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:26.939> i

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
distances so 5k for me is really as long

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.799

March<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> Toronto<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.689> literally

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
March so in Toronto that's literally

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
March so in Toronto that's literally
just<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> snow<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> melting<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> spent

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
just as the snow is melting so I spent

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
just as the snow is melting so I spent
all<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.869> winter<00:01:16.140> training<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
all of the winter training on the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.730 
all of the winter training on the
treadmill<00:01:17.280> indoors<00:01:18.290> when<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> went<00:01:19.590> through

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
treadmill indoors when I went through

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.649 
treadmill indoors when I went through
and<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:21.150> even<00:01:21.240> think<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and so I don't even think I had a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
and so I don't even think I had a
session<00:01:22.140> outdoors<00:01:22.619> before<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> race<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.520> ran

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
session outdoors before the race I ran

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.819 
session outdoors before the race I ran
the<00:01:24.450> race<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.799> tanked<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
the race and I just it tanked I was so

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
the race and I just it tanked I was so
done<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.159> was<00:01:29.340> crazy<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.840> reason<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
done it was crazy because the reason is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.440 
done it was crazy because the reason is
that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:32.159> running<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> treadmill<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that I was running on a treadmill and I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.609 
that I was running on a treadmill and I

moving<00:01:37.229> forward<00:01:37.640> outdoors<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.600> moving

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
moving forward outdoors you are moving

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
moving forward outdoors you are moving
forward<00:01:40.290> there's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> perceptual<00:01:41.070> difference

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
forward there's a perceptual difference

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
forward there's a perceptual difference
in<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:41.880> seeing<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
in what you're seeing and that that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
in what you're seeing and that that
changes<00:01:44.899> visually<00:01:45.899> how<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:47.009> body<00:01:47.159> responds

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
changes visually how your body responds

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
changes visually how your body responds
to<00:01:47.700> running<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.420> also<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:49.470> outdoors<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to running but also like outdoors you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.249 
to running but also like outdoors you
have<00:01:50.399> wind<00:01:50.670> resistance<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
have wind resistance you have the up and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
have wind resistance you have the up and
down<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> hilly

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
down a little bit if there is a hilly

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
down a little bit if there is a hilly
course<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.079> Judy<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.009> really<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> look

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
course so Judy you really want to look

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.340 
course so Judy you really want to look
at<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.689> idea<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
at can you get an idea of what the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
at can you get an idea of what the
course<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.640> can<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.270> even<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
course is like and then can you even get

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.969 
course is like and then can you even get
on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> course<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.590> run<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on the course I have a time and run that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.510 
on the course I have a time and run that
course<00:02:03.500> because<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.219> that'd<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
course because if you can that'd be

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
course because if you can that'd be
really<00:02:05.729> beneficial<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
really beneficial you know it's like the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.339 
really beneficial you know it's like the
f1<00:02:07.799> drivers<00:02:08.160> they've<00:02:08.759> raced<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.330> Sunday

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
f1 drivers they've raced it on Sunday

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.550 
f1 drivers they've raced it on Sunday
I<00:02:10.379> believe<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
I believe they have a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.710 
I believe they have a
back<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.860> session<00:02:12.340> or<00:02:12.700> time<00:02:13.209> trials<00:02:13.630> or

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
back this session or time trials or

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680 
back this session or time trials or
something<00:02:14.080> or<00:02:14.920> qualifying<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> Friday<00:02:16.360> or

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
something or qualifying on the Friday or

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.690 
something or qualifying on the Friday or
Saturday<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.319> they<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.709> good<00:02:18.010> idea<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
Saturday so they get a good idea of the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.089 
Saturday so they get a good idea of the
course<00:02:19.060> before<00:02:19.270> they<00:02:19.540> really<00:02:20.080> really<00:02:20.830> drive

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
course before they really really drive

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.979 
course before they really really drive
it<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:22.090> recommend<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> same<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:22.900> you

internal trainer were kids you can use

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.009 
internal trainer were kids you can use
the<00:02:32.980> TV<00:02:33.459> rolling<00:02:33.970> Hill<00:02:34.120> intervals<00:02:34.510> which<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.870> a

crazy awesome workout it's for the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.339 
crazy awesome workout it's for the
treadmill<00:02:37.930> specific<00:02:38.530> obviously<00:02:39.780> because<00:02:40.780> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
treadmill specific obviously because the

treadmill specific obviously because the
one<00:02:41.530> thing<00:02:41.739> we're<00:02:41.920> running<00:02:42.190> hills<00:02:42.400> outdoors

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
one thing we're running hills outdoors

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.270 
one thing we're running hills outdoors
is<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.049> hill<00:02:44.260> eventually<00:02:44.709> stops<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
is that the hill eventually stops and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
is that the hill eventually stops and
you<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.910> come<00:02:46.090> back<00:02:46.269> down<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.720> that's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
you have to come back down and that's

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.039 
you have to come back down and that's
fine<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.690> anyways

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
fine because you have to do that anyways

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.199 
fine because you have to do that anyways
in<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.260> race<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:50.950> terms<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.340> really

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
in a race but in terms of really

in a race but in terms of really
bettering<00:02:52.870> your<00:02:52.989> Hill<00:02:53.230> running<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.190> can

climb forever like you've never have to
come<00:02:57.910> back<00:02:58.060> down<00:02:58.209> which<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.569> good<00:02:58.690> because<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
come back down which is good because it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.360

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
that's where we really that's the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.059 
that's where we really that's the
hardest<00:03:04.200> portion<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.349> in<00:03:05.500> terms<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
hardest portion of that in terms of the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.910 
hardest portion of that in terms of the
effect<00:03:06.580> on<00:03:06.730> our<00:03:06.819> body<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> treadmill

you<00:03:09.190> can<00:03:09.220> really<00:03:09.790> get<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.440> benefit<00:03:11.830> of

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
you can really get the the benefit of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.320 
you can really get the the benefit of
the<00:03:12.010> uphill<00:03:12.280> sprints<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.880> then<00:03:13.000> bring<00:03:13.180> back

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
the uphill sprints and then bring back

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.059 
the uphill sprints and then bring back
the<00:03:13.510> flat<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.110> recovery<00:03:14.349> if<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.650> wanted<00:03:14.920> to

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
the flat for a recovery if you wanted to
