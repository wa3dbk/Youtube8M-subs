alright<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> data

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
alright so that is how you get the data

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
alright so that is how you get the data
to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> drive<00:00:32.969> from<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.420> computer<00:00:33.840> with

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to the drive from your computer with

whatever interface you want USB 2

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.049 
whatever interface you want USB 2
firewire<00:00:36.600> eSATA<00:00:37.079> USB<00:00:37.200> 3<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.610> fine<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
firewire eSATA USB 3 all that's fine and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.030 
firewire eSATA USB 3 all that's fine and
good<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.870> why<00:00:40.050> does<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.260> come<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.680> cover

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
good so why does it come with this cover

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
good so why does it come with this cover
if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.120> order<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> access<00:00:42.600> your

if you need that in order to access your

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
if you need that in order to access your
data<00:00:43.050> well<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> answer<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
data well the answer to that is that the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720 
data well the answer to that is that the
go<00:00:45.629> flex<00:00:45.930> satellite<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.559> actually<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> wireless

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
go flex satellite is actually a wireless

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
go flex satellite is actually a wireless
sharing<00:00:48.360> drive<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> allows<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sharing drive so what it allows you to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.020 
sharing drive so what it allows you to
do<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> by<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.719> turning<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.030> setting

in some ways unless you're willing to

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.040 
in some ways unless you're willing to
take<00:04:30.730> your<00:04:30.880> whole<00:04:31.030> media<00:04:31.330> library<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
take your whole media library and

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.879 
take your whole media library and
convert<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.980> into<00:04:33.130> iOS<00:04:33.940> compatible<00:04:34.889> formats

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
convert it into iOS compatible formats

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.770 
convert it into iOS compatible formats
now<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.190> do<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.490> other<00:04:36.760> options<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.419> can

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
now you do have other options you can

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.600 
now you do have other options you can
see<00:04:37.960> right<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.710> an<00:04:38.860> episode<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> The

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
see right here I have an episode of The

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.760 
see right here I have an episode of The
Big<00:04:39.760> Bang<00:04:40.000> Theory<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.470> will<00:04:41.590> take<00:04:41.710> a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
Big Bang Theory so this will take a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.129 
Big Bang Theory so this will take a
second<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.370> then<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.639> will<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.630> guys<00:04:43.930> can

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
second and then it will so you guys can

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.170 
second and then it will so you guys can
see<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.410> progress<00:04:44.620> bar<00:04:44.830> here<00:04:45.340> this<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.910> one<00:04:46.060> of

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
see the progress bar here this is one of

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.659 
see the progress bar here this is one of
the<00:04:46.410> disadvantages<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:48.160> format

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
the disadvantages of the format

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.540 
the disadvantages of the format
limitations<00:04:49.270> on<00:04:49.450> iOS<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.130> use<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
limitations on iOS so I have to use the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.310 
limitations on iOS so I have to use the

something that is not iPhone compatible

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.140 
something that is not iPhone compatible
you<00:04:56.440> can<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.800> here<00:04:57.070> what<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.460> actually<00:04:57.610> has<00:04:58.000> to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
you can see here what it actually has to

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.180 
you can see here what it actually has to
do<00:04:58.240> is<00:04:58.419> download<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.870> entire<00:04:59.410> file<00:04:59.770> to<00:05:00.070> the

do is download the entire file to the
phones<00:05:00.400> cache<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.120> then<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.960> will<00:05:02.110> give<00:05:02.320> me

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.760 
through the Seagate app or through a
browser<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.960> how<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.260> would<00:05:38.350> work<00:05:38.410> on

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
browser so this is how it would work on

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.719 
browser so this is how it would work on
other<00:05:39.160> devices<00:05:39.580> as<00:05:39.970> well<00:05:41.130> now<00:05:42.130> two<00:05:42.190> really

this is still capable of being user
firmware<00:06:07.479> upgradeable<00:06:08.260> so<00:06:08.590> that<00:06:08.710> means<00:06:08.889> you

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
firmware upgradeable so that means you

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.500

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
additional functionality for the goal

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.100 
additional functionality for the goal
flex<00:06:18.160> satellite<00:06:18.639> in<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.240> future<00:06:19.450> so<00:06:19.960> that's

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
flex satellite in the future so that's

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.820 
flex satellite in the future so that's
very<00:06:20.350> cool

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
very cool

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.710 
very cool
also<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.460> note<00:06:21.610> is<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:21.850> fact<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.270> if<00:06:22.450> you<00:06:22.539> do

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
also of note is the fact that if you do

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120 
also of note is the fact that if you do
do<00:06:22.900> a<00:06:22.930> firmware<00:06:23.200> upgrade<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.979> is<00:06:24.100> a

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
do a firmware upgrade it is a

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.129 
do a firmware upgrade it is a
non-destructive<00:06:24.700> firmware<00:06:25.389> upgrade<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.080> you

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
non-destructive firmware upgrade so you

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.570 
non-destructive firmware upgrade so you
won't<00:06:26.410> have<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.710> wipe<00:06:26.860> your<00:06:27.070> data<00:06:27.220> and

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
won't have to wipe your data and

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.650 
won't have to wipe your data and
reformat<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.419> drive

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
reformat the drive

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.350 
reformat the drive
so<00:06:29.590> in<00:06:29.740> conclusion<00:06:29.919> here<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:30.700> have<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.150> three

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
so in conclusion here I have the three

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.300 
so in conclusion here I have the three
devices<00:06:31.690> these<00:06:32.320> two<00:06:32.560> are<00:06:32.650> playing<00:06:32.919> the<00:06:33.100> same

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
devices these two are playing the same

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.550 
devices these two are playing the same
file<00:06:33.639> this<00:06:34.210> one<00:06:34.419> is<00:06:34.539> playing<00:06:34.780> a<00:06:34.900> separate<00:06:35.289> file

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
file this one is playing a separate file

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.020 
file this one is playing a separate file
these<00:06:35.800> are<00:06:35.979> playing<00:06:36.250> through<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.610> app<00:06:36.729> with

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
these are playing through the app with

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.210 
these are playing through the app with
compatible<00:06:37.599> media<00:06:37.900> this<00:06:38.440> is<00:06:38.680> playing<00:06:38.950> through

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
compatible media this is playing through

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.999 
compatible media this is playing through
the<00:06:39.400> browser

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
the browser

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.920 
the browser
based<00:06:40.159> one<00:06:40.400> using<00:06:40.939> old<00:06:41.180> player<00:06:41.479> to<00:06:41.749> play

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
based one using old player to play

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.899 
based one using old player to play
incompatible<00:06:42.650> media<00:06:42.949> and<00:06:43.219> I<00:06:43.550> just<00:06:43.699> want<00:06:43.849> to

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
incompatible media and I just want to

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.579 
incompatible media and I just want to
talk<00:06:43.999> about<00:06:44.270> a<00:06:44.300> few<00:06:44.569> more<00:06:44.629> additional<00:06:45.349> things

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:45.589 
talk about a few more additional things

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.969 
talk about a few more additional things
so<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:46.249> free<00:06:46.460> agent<00:06:46.819> go<00:06:47.180> flex<00:06:47.740> satellite<00:06:48.740> is

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
so the free agent go flex satellite is

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.889 
so the free agent go flex satellite is
actually<00:06:49.639> advertised<00:06:50.300> to<00:06:50.479> run<00:06:50.629> for<00:06:50.809> about

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899 
actually advertised to run for about

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:52.839 
actually advertised to run for about
four<00:06:51.289> hours<00:06:51.619> so<00:06:51.800> that's<00:06:51.919> great<00:06:52.189> once<00:06:52.580> again

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
four hours so that's great once again

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.329 
four hours so that's great once again
for<00:06:53.180> a<00:06:53.210> roadtrip<00:06:53.809> type<00:06:54.080> scenario<00:06:54.559> it<00:06:55.009> comes

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
for a roadtrip type scenario it comes

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.339 
for a roadtrip type scenario it comes
with<00:06:55.550> a<00:06:55.580> car<00:06:55.939> charger<00:06:55.969> so<00:06:56.899> you<00:06:56.930> can<00:06:57.080> actually

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
with a car charger so you can actually

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.139 
with a car charger so you can actually
run<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:57.830> continuously<00:06:58.490> while<00:06:58.729> you're<00:06:58.909> in<00:06:59.029> the

00:06:59.139 --> 00:06:59.149 
run it continuously while you're in the

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.749 
run it continuously while you're in the
car<00:06:59.360> or<00:06:59.719> like<00:07:00.349> I<00:07:00.499> said<00:07:00.680> for<00:07:00.889> four<00:07:01.099> hours<00:07:01.399> out<00:07:01.580> on
