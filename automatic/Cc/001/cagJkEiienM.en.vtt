00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
knife can I actually run it vertical and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
knife can I actually run it vertical and
is<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.789> any<00:00:47.940> rattling<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> pull<00:00:49.260> the

is there any rattling when I pull the
knife<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.610> also<00:00:50.850> comes<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
knife in and out it also comes with this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.350 
knife in and out it also comes with this
removable<00:00:52.850> attachable<00:00:53.850> whatever<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
removable attachable whatever going to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
removable attachable whatever going to
call<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> belt<00:00:55.230> loop<00:00:55.500> which<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
call it belt loop which I do like the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
call it belt loop which I do like the
reason<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.680> profile

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
reason I like it is because the profile

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.610 
reason I like it is because the profile
is<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.550> slim<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> doesn't<00:01:00.300> take<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
is so slim it doesn't take up a lot of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.090 
is so slim it doesn't take up a lot of
room<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.520> bolt<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.100> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
room and you can bolt it on like so you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
room and you can bolt it on like so you
