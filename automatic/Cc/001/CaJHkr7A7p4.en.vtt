00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 hello, these people are again in 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.550
 minecraft xbox 360 and is talking 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.830
 us the seed that is incredible and 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.160
 our seeds this here in the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.849
 screen can see the seed is scripted 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.710
 7 999 0 1 389 I'm not going to put in the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.560
 description because I'm showing it 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.140
 right here and it's the seed that I'm going to 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.270
 use for my new series I'm going to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.030
 modify the map put a few 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.420
 things create a lobby modify the lobby 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.980
 and start the series from scratch what I'm going 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.899
 to start is the lobby and everything 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.180
 and some dead people and all that 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.489
 so we started from scratch with some 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 how many motors in the hands of explored 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.579
 only this will be modified to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.949
 principle but the rest of the map our 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.490
 nothing like this explorer or anything 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.160
 so only the surface will be 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.860
 explored a small part and what I'm going 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.650
 to show now will also be this 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.869
 be explored but the rest of the map 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.360
 same the caverns and everything else 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.729
 it will be perfectly new and good 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.490
 to start it so they can see that because 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.979
 Epic put sit or because seed is called 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.470
 epic and good I hope great copied 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.259
 So the beginning of the video for 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.220
 who see the the copy in your minecraft 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.220
 the chicken 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.090
 and in this apart from the snow this is a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.910
 biome that there are many people do not we 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.740
 like but sometimes it's very good 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.840
 good for each walking in front of 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.080
 I have the skin of batman van der 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.430
 batman vaart that still accompanies and the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.230
 We really liked it because it shows us its 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.320
 hand see do not go to the hand of de burt 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.970
 solomons to him only in our the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.460
 way of humerus and the other personal 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.710
 but I think that part of the ship not 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.210
 shows it but well this can be a 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 advantage or a disadvantage but who knows 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.500
 it depends on the person that what 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.300
 like it and well the bad thing is that neither 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 it comes to test are few characters 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.100
 I thought they were going to put all the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.710
 characters that are in in the simpsons 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.910
 but they just did not put it right 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.810
 we appear near a village we enter 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.970
 the house with 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.050
 the blacksmith's house and let's check that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.989
 we have inside let's go here the chest of 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.420
 copper let's see that we find six 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.520
 diamonds 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.700
 6 diamonds in the buy a peak of 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.400
 iron with iron meshes and this 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.610
 it's enough to start mining 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.860
 to make a pick and a sword and a 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.959
 shovel or as you want as you want 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.150
 use it but here is leaving for the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.270
 peaks rests us by a sword 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.069
 possibly a shovel and a pick and this 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.069
 we have the extra peak for use tico 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.530
 to mine and then to break blocks or 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.940
 combine a little bit faster but 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.840
 comes this the seed that I'm going to use 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.819
 for my next series and this we will go 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.579
 indicating some parts 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.129
 the previous series was modified the 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.889
 map and by mistake it spoiled the 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.230
 map and then you can not open it anymore 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.840
 I could not continue with the series of the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.870
 Series 2 season is over 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.930
 practically already finished then I'm going to 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.659
 Start season 3 with a new map 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.810
 and with a lobby so everyone was in 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.800
 inside I did not see in a radius of 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.290
 of 24 radio blocks and it would not be a 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.860
 radio would be a 20 x 20 dimension of 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.400
 blocks and this one may appear 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.130
 there and go to the different places of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.550
 sea ​​for example if we point if I did 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.000
 watch 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:04.310
 it's not north here I do not know north of where 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.220
 the sun comes out that is where you should know that 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.320
 privileges to fly the sun the sun will 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.680
 located where it is not severely 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.650
 bright but it's on that side 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.590
 the sun comes out in front then the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.270
 north is towards that side the south would be the 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.509
 taken then they will move from the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.610
 four points north on east and west and 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.820
 the lobby will be practically in the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.520
 center of the map there will be where you think 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.740
 the lobby and everyone dispersed to the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.410
 different areas of the map and I hope that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.419
 all players create their homes a 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.639
 A little bit apart from the other houses 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.080
 that they do not steal your things or just 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.440
 so that they do not feel from house to house to 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.199
 check and good this stand was 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.990
 it's just great and there are many 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.789
 more things in I think there 's more 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.039
 to the day of this one that review has more 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.740
 burning has more diamond and they have more 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.070
 things very signs but hey this is the 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.520
 better than I have found so far 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.840
 it's amazing because 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.280
 It has 6 diamonds and well that's it 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.440
 thanks for this video I hope that you 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.940
 have liked this seed at the beginning 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.460
 of the video shows that the seeds 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.800
 but that they copy it and they can enter 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.199
 this seed and start a series or 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.699
 simply start a map of 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.320
 survival and certainly appear 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.420
 horses very close 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.130
 great good see you I'll do 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.130
 because here and until later goodbye
