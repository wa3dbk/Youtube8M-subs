use posada automata pureed works just as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.400 
use posada automata pureed works just as
well<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.569> don't<00:02:08.750> worry<00:02:09.019> if<00:02:09.140> you've<00:02:09.259> got<00:02:09.380> a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
well and don't worry if you've got a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.280 
well and don't worry if you've got a
little<00:02:09.709> bits<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.069> meat<00:02:10.310> stuck<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.000> bottom

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.040 
pretty I think that's what gives the
sauce<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> really<00:02:16.190> nice<00:02:16.610> taste<00:02:17.060> now<00:02:17.870> I'm
