00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 symphony 6 is one of the first 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.180
 smartphones asus here in Brazil the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.220
 has a 6- inch screen and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.440
 settings as good as the two in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.869
 fones 51 symphony 6 is a large cell phone 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.670
 It is easy to notice this when we put 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.039
 next to other devices 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 it is larger than the galaxy note 4 of the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.369
 samsung and also that the iphone 6 plus of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.619
 apple 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 the screen resolution of the iphones and 6 not 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.610
 is very good especially because 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.899
 we expected excellent quality already 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 what display is large 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.300
 are 720 by 1280 pixels with 245 pp ii 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 the screen is ips which helps to provide good 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 viewing angles 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 in addition the protection gorilla glass 3 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 to prevent it from breaking and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 easily in terms of ergonomics. 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 device is not one of the best 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.000
 Even people who have a medium-sized 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 certain difficulty in holding the gadget 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.530
 realizing this blues made a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 interesting modification on android in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 notification bar to an option that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 reduces the interface so you can 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.689
 perform most of the activities with 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.060
 just one hand 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.850
 this is not an exclusive thing of the asus 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 apple also did this on iphone 6 plus the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.180
 symphony 6 has intel atom processor 11 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.009
 25 60 with a maximum speed of 1.6 ghz and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.799
 two processing cores 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.799
 support for two carrier chips 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:34.590
 2 gb ram and gpu powervr road 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 android jelly bean system two things 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.250
 phone is missing 61 m 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.409
 4g support 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 a highlight of the product is its 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.579
 battery life during tests 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.159
 performed at infolab the battery lasted 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.110
 for almost eight hours ie the battery 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 iphone 6 is better than the new 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.930
 motor g 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 as mentioned cases the system

 6 android 4.3 jelly bean 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.030
 but it passes away from being pure blue 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.070
 uses the interface called 100 and so what is it? 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 the same we saw on iphone 5 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 there are a number of applications 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.039
 literally pre-installed more than a thousand 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.209
 changes in the system according to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.610
 own company 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.980
 on the other hand internal 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.970
 daily usability symphony 6 does not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.340
 disappoint 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.940
 it did well in playing videos 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.250
 and games as well as in task management. 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.200
 iphone 6 costs a thousand reais here in brazil 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.080
 which puts you in the fray against the galaxy 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.180
 5 mini and xperia m2 water but the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.500
 differential of this apparatus is precisely 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.510
 your spacious screen 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 see the following settings and until the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.840
 next 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.500
