00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
taking the crossroads off of this 2004

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
taking the crossroads off of this 2004
xc70<00:00:22.369> there<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> roof<00:00:23.880> rack<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.390> there

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
xc70 there on the roof rack up there

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
xc70 there on the roof rack up there
they<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.769> side<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.039> car<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
they go from one side of car to the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
they go from one side of car to the
other<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.480> gonna<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.260> 850

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
other and I'm gonna put them on my 850

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.840 
other and I'm gonna put them on my 850
since<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.529> roof<00:00:31.529> rails<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.669> V

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
since I have the roof rails off of a V

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
since I have the roof rails off of a V
70<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> measured<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.950> space<00:00:35.309> between<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
70 now I measured the space between the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.569 
70 now I measured the space between the
right<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.360> left<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.710> seems<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.280> these

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
right and left and it seems like these

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.780 
right and left and it seems like these
are<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.360> inch<00:00:39.660> closer<00:00:40.230> together<00:00:40.579> than<00:00:41.579> they

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
are one inch closer together than they

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.860 
are one inch closer together than they
are<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.270> car

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
are my car

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.910 
are my car
however<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.129> looks<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:45.920> cross

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
however it also looks like these cross

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
however it also looks like these cross
rails<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.239> adjusted<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
rails can be adjusted in and out a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.270 
rails can be adjusted in and out a
little<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.969> rails<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:52.890> little

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
little and these rails are a little

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
little and these rails are a little
wider<00:00:53.520> than<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> rails<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> came<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
wider than the rails that came on the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
wider than the rails that came on the
p80<00:00:56.399> Volvo's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.229 

and<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> security<00:01:03.309> torque<00:01:03.760> driver

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
and this is a security torque driver

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.370 
and this is a security torque driver
it's<00:01:05.199> got<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.500> hollow<00:01:05.860> tip<00:01:06.670> on<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:08.080> use

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
it's got a hollow tip on it that you use

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's got a hollow tip on it that you use
to<00:01:08.830> fit<00:01:09.670> over<00:01:09.940> that<00:01:10.409> special<00:01:11.409> screw<00:01:11.770> with<00:01:12.610> that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
to fit over that special screw with that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.420 
to fit over that special screw with that
stud<00:01:13.150> in<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> middle<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.710> make<00:01:14.950> sure<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.310> got

stud in the middle so make sure you got
the<00:01:15.490> right<00:01:15.790> bit<00:01:16.060> before<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:16.630> out<00:01:16.899> there<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the right bit before you go out there to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.810 
the right bit before you go out there to
remove<00:01:17.440> so<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.920> take<00:01:18.220> your<00:01:18.250> flat<00:01:18.549> tip

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
that

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.249 
that
now<00:01:27.070> when<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.340> looked<00:01:27.670> at<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:27.940> bottom<00:01:28.149> of<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
now when I looked at the bottom of the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.940 
now when I looked at the bottom of the
cap<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:30.009> was<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:30.430> there<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.539> latch<00:01:32.080> has<00:01:32.920> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
cap that was on there the latch has a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.600 
cap that was on there the latch has a
flat<00:01:33.460> part<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.270> there<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:35.530> fits<00:01:35.950> into<00:01:36.250> this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
flat part on there that fits into this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.359 
flat part on there that fits into this
flat<00:01:37.000> groove<00:01:37.390> there<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.530> do<00:01:38.800> have<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.009> turn

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
flat groove there so you do have to turn

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.940 
flat groove there so you do have to turn
these<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.610> quarter<00:01:40.030> turn<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.659> work<00:01:40.869> them<00:01:41.050> off<00:01:41.229> so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
these a quarter turn to work them off so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.770 
these a quarter turn to work them off so
I<00:01:41.979> didn't<00:01:42.429> even<00:01:42.520> take<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.060> out<00:01:43.179> I<00:01:43.240> took<00:01:43.630> it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
I didn't even take it out I took it

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.770 
I didn't even take it out I took it
loose<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.200> few<00:01:44.409> turns<00:01:44.940> pushed<00:01:45.940> pushed<00:01:46.600> it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
loose a few turns pushed pushed it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.580 
loose a few turns pushed pushed it
toward<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> other<00:01:47.259> side<00:01:47.909> lifted<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.030> up<00:01:49.149> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
toward the other side lifted it up and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.710 
toward the other side lifted it up and
now<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.979> seems<00:01:51.310> like<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.700> could<00:01:52.000> probably<00:01:52.179> pull

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
now it seems like I could probably pull

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.169 
now it seems like I could probably pull
it<00:01:52.840> off<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.170> other<00:01:53.380> side<00:01:53.679> but<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.460> may<00:01:54.759> go<00:01:55.000> over

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
it off the other side but I may go over

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.999 
it off the other side but I may go over
there<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.479> loosen<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.229> don't<00:01:56.560> tear<00:01:56.830> that

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
there and loosen it so I don't tear that

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.139 
there and loosen it so I don't tear that
rubber<00:01:57.340> seal<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:59.049> that<00:02:00.039> that's<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.789> took

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
rubber seal that that that's it took

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.440 
rubber seal that that that's it took
this<00:02:01.299> rail<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:01.899> here<00:02:02.140> loosen<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:03.450> shift

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
this rail here here loosen that up shift

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.419
