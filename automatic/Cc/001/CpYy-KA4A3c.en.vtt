00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
right now it's a camera mode and this

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
right now it's a camera mode and this
screen<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.640> 3d<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> pretty

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
screen is actually in 3d which is pretty

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.130 
screen is actually in 3d which is pretty
amazing<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.090> need<00:00:27.150> glasses<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.019> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
amazing you don't need glasses and you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
amazing you don't need glasses and you
actually<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> 3d<00:00:28.920> effect<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> 3.8

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
actually get the 3d effect this is a 3.8

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.479 
actually get the 3d effect this is a 3.8
inch<00:00:30.529> syringe<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> partly<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> same<00:00:32.250> screen

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
inch syringe is partly the same screen

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
inch syringe is partly the same screen
that<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.510> Nintendo<00:00:33.989> 3ds<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> use

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that in the Nintendo 3ds is going to use

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.410 
that in the Nintendo 3ds is going to use
I'm<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.460> guessing<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.300> it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I'm just guessing but I think it's

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
I'm just guessing but I think it's
partly<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> same<00:00:36.989> soon<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.890> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
partly the same soon and it really

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.549 
partly the same soon and it really
depends<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> right

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
depends what you have to be at the right

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.520 
depends what you have to be at the right
distance<00:00:41.090> somehow<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.690> 30<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.200> 50

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
distance somehow it's like 30 to 50

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
distance somehow it's like 30 to 50
centimeters<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.030> straight

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
centimeters and you have to be straight

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.680 
centimeters and you have to be straight
ahead<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> middle<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.789> depends<00:00:48.090> how

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
ahead in the middle and it depends how

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
ahead in the middle and it depends how
far<00:00:48.960> apart<00:00:49.200> maybe<00:00:49.620> i'm<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.070> guessing<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
far apart maybe i'm just guessing it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
far apart maybe i'm just guessing it
might<00:00:51.149> depend<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.660> far<00:00:51.870> apart<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.289> eyes<00:00:52.410> are

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
might depend how far apart your eyes are

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.340 
might depend how far apart your eyes are
or<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> provides<00:00:54.809> each<00:00:55.079> eye

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
or not but then it provides each eye

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
or not but then it provides each eye
with<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> different<00:00:55.980> image<00:00:56.190> without<00:00:56.550> glasses

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with a different image without glasses

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
with a different image without glasses
which<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.260> interesting<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.770> some

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
which is really interesting this some

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
which is really interesting this some
kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.399> mirror<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.449> something

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
kind of a mirror thing with something

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
kind of a mirror thing with something
inside<00:01:01.079> doing<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.399> effect<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.820> know

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
inside doing that that effect you know

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.370 
inside doing that that effect you know
more<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.480> until<00:01:04.159> here<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.460> okay<00:01:06.380> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
more about it until here it is okay it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.039 
more about it until here it is okay it
says<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> 810<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.390> ID<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.869> white

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
says for the 810 for ID so it's white

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.760 
says for the 810 for ID so it's white

pretty road in 3d mode as in then you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
pretty road in 3d mode as in then you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
get half half the resolution for one eye

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.179 
get half half the resolution for one eye
and<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> other<00:01:19.530> half<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> other<00:01:20.070> eye

and the other half of the other eye

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.720 
and the other half of the other eye
that's<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> isn't<00:01:21.390> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
that's right it isn't kind of the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.550 
that's right it isn't kind of the
crystal<00:01:23.570> something<00:01:23.960> like<00:01:24.140> they're<00:01:24.290> kind<00:01:24.470> of

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
crystal something like they're kind of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.670 
crystal something like they're kind of
form-fitting<00:01:25.400> destruct<00:01:26.240> it's<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.200> paradox<00:01:27.530> for

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
form-fitting destruct it's a paradox for

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.970 
form-fitting destruct it's a paradox for
you<00:01:27.890> technology<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:29.170> they're<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.410> eyes<00:01:30.620> go

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
you technology so they're the eyes go

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.070 
you technology so they're the eyes go
through<00:01:31.310> some<00:01:31.700> kind<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.940> barrier<00:01:32.510> thing<00:01:32.900> with

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
don't know if there's a if one can get

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.300 
don't know if there's a if one can get
this<00:02:41.550> yet<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.739> check<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.040> here

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this yet all but if you check out here

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
this yet all but if you check out here
again<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:47.940> two<00:02:48.150> two<00:02:48.420> cameras

again then so there are two two cameras

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.400 
again then so there are two two cameras
to<00:02:50.250> record<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.700> 3d<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.030> course<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
to record the 3d of course and then it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
to record the 3d of course and then it
just<00:02:52.440> outputs<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> straight<00:02:53.940> ahead<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.299> you
