specialty<00:00:35.430> services<00:00:36.430> there's<00:00:37.030> two<00:00:37.239> things

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
specialty services there's two things

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.170 
specialty services there's two things
that<00:00:37.930> improve<00:00:38.530> results<00:00:38.890> one<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.730> those<00:00:39.850> things

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
that improve results one of those things

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.690 
that improve results one of those things
is<00:00:40.480> fellowship<00:00:40.960> training<00:00:41.410> so<00:00:42.100> if<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.370> train

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
is fellowship training so if you train

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000 
is fellowship training so if you train
with<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.030> best<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.780> have<00:00:43.990> a<00:00:44.020> chance<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.590> be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
with the best you have a chance to be

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010 
with the best you have a chance to be
the<00:00:45.160> best<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:46.360> second<00:00:46.720> thing<00:00:46.840> is<00:00:46.990> a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
the best and the second thing is a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.680 
the best and the second thing is a
volume<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:48.130> more<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.550> something<00:00:48.790> you<00:00:49.000> do<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
volume the more of something you do the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.760

these different disease processes that

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.100 
these different disease processes that

were used to dealing with and that

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.220 
were used to dealing with and that
translates<00:00:59.770> into<00:01:00.130> better<00:01:00.220> results<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:01.230> think

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230

patient

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.649 
patient
I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.700> quality<00:01:39.850> healthcare<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.509> what

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
I think quality healthcare is what

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.130 
I think quality healthcare is what
everyone<00:01:41.610> strives<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:43.180> do<00:01:43.329> in<00:01:43.570> centerra<00:01:43.960> and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
everyone strives to do in centerra and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.359 
everyone strives to do in centerra and
throughout<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.860> think<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.159> really<00:01:45.250> just

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
throughout and I think it really just

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.389 
throughout and I think it really just
means<00:01:45.759> being<00:01:46.659> very<00:01:47.049> attentive<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.189> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
means being very attentive to the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.950 
means being very attentive to the
patient<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.360> details<00:01:49.719> of<00:01:49.899> the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
patient and to the details of the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.870 
patient and to the details of the
patient<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.380> having<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.860> good<00:01:51.039> team<00:01:51.460> approach

to<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.710> care<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.039> patient<00:01:54.429> I

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
to the to the care of the patient I

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.740 
to the to the care of the patient I
think<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.030> biggest<00:01:55.179> thing<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.569> communication

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
think the biggest thing is communication

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.389 
think the biggest thing is communication
between<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.649> different<00:01:56.979> people<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.250> are

between the different people that are

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.899 
between the different people that are
involved<00:01:57.670> be<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.049> primary<00:01:59.350> care<00:01:59.829> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
involved be it the primary care the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.980 
involved be it the primary care the
gastroenterologist<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.119> oncologist<00:02:01.840> it

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
gastroenterologist the oncologist it

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.200 
gastroenterologist the oncologist it
really<00:02:02.259> involves<00:02:02.500> good<00:02:03.340> close<00:02:03.640> communication

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
really involves good close communication

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.499 
really involves good close communication
being<00:02:04.810> part<00:02:05.079> of<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.259> big<00:02:05.409> group<00:02:05.439> with<00:02:06.509> with

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
excellent opportunity for a patient to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.870 
excellent opportunity for a patient to
undergo<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.530> procedure<00:04:21.739> that's<00:04:22.280> minimally

undergo a procedure that's minimally

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.120 
undergo a procedure that's minimally
invasive<00:04:23.200> it's<00:04:24.200> part<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.590> what's<00:04:24.770> known<00:04:24.950> as

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
invasive it's part of what's known as

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.730 
invasive it's part of what's known as
the<00:04:25.280> natural<00:04:25.520> orifice<00:04:26.240> re<00:04:26.660> where<00:04:27.350> procedure

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
the natural orifice re where procedure

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.770 
the natural orifice re where procedure
is<00:04:27.860> done<00:04:28.040> through<00:04:28.520> an<00:04:28.940> opening<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.600> body

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
so essentially leaves no scar so patient

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.350 
so essentially leaves no scar so patient
might<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.710> referred<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.370> me<00:04:34.520> with<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> rectal

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
might be referred to me with a rectal

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240 
might be referred to me with a rectal
lesion<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:36.260> otherwise<00:04:36.590> could<00:04:36.919> not<00:04:36.950> be

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
lesion that otherwise could not be

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.370 
lesion that otherwise could not be
removed<00:04:37.430> through<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.150> anus<00:04:38.450> because<00:04:38.810> too<00:04:39.140> far

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
removed through the anus because too far

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.070 
removed through the anus because too far
up<00:04:39.680> with<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.400> technology<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:41.510> allows<00:04:41.780> me

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
up with this technology that allows me

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.680 
up with this technology that allows me
to<00:04:42.370> reach<00:04:43.370> higher<00:04:43.700> up<00:04:43.940> into<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> rectum

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
to reach higher up into the rectum

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.830 
to reach higher up into the rectum
remove<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.710> whole<00:04:45.919> lesion<00:04:46.430> sew<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.390> up<00:04:47.540> and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
remove the whole lesion sew it up and

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.630 
remove the whole lesion sew it up and
then<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.530> patient<00:04:48.890> typically<00:04:49.160> can<00:04:49.340> go<00:04:49.460> home

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
then the patient typically can go home

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.430 
then the patient typically can go home
same<00:04:49.970> day<00:04:51.910> part<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:53.030> quality<00:04:53.410> healthcare<00:04:54.410> I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
same day part of quality healthcare I

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.530 
same day part of quality healthcare I
think<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:55.190> working<00:04:55.640> as<00:04:56.030> part<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.390> a

think is working as part of a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.930

in<00:05:12.650> particular<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.520> benefit<00:05:14.120> with<00:05:14.330> a

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
in particular a benefit with a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.750 
in particular a benefit with a
colorectal<00:05:14.810> nurse<00:05:15.170> specialist<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:16.640> was

colorectal nurse specialist it was

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.130 
colorectal nurse specialist it was
essentially<00:05:17.210> what<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.390> consider<00:05:17.840> the

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
essentially what I consider the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.130 
essentially what I consider the
colorectal<00:05:18.610> concierge<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.180> she<00:05:20.450> essentially

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
colorectal concierge and she essentially

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.720 
colorectal concierge and she essentially
takes<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.620> patient<00:05:21.980> from<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.490> very

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
takes the patient from the very

surgery

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.420 
surgery
I<00:05:32.720> think<00:05:33.200> it's<00:05:33.350> that<00:05:33.470> team<00:05:33.770> approach<00:05:33.950> that

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
I think it's that team approach that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.240 
I think it's that team approach that
really<00:05:34.960> provides<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.140> professionalism<00:05:36.950> and

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
really provides the professionalism and

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.550 
really provides the professionalism and
excellent<00:05:37.730> care<00:05:37.910> that<00:05:38.120> we<00:05:38.210> can<00:05:38.360> provide<00:05:38.560> well

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
excellent care that we can provide well

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.290 
excellent care that we can provide well
I<00:05:39.590> think<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:40.280> know<00:05:40.400> we're<00:05:40.760> in<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.090> business

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
I think you know we're in the business

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.510 
I think you know we're in the business
to<00:05:41.780> help<00:05:41.810> people<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.740> I<00:05:42.860> think<00:05:42.920> that's<00:05:43.250> one

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
to help people and I think that's one

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.240 
to help people and I think that's one
thing<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:43.790> Sentara<00:05:44.420> tries<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.230> promote<00:05:45.440> with

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
thing that Sentara tries to promote with

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.850 
thing that Sentara tries to promote with
its<00:05:46.430> physicians<00:05:47.030> is<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.630> idea<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.830> know

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
its physicians is this idea of you know

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.680 
its physicians is this idea of you know
we're<00:05:49.100> here<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.460> help<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:49.910> patient<00:05:50.390> and<00:05:50.480> you

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.440 
always have to remember that at Sentara
I<00:05:53.120> think<00:05:53.450> it's<00:05:53.570> our<00:05:53.720> goal<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.410> educate<00:05:55.450> to

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
I think it's our goal to educate to

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.340 
I think it's our goal to educate to
correctly<00:05:57.080> diagnose<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:58.300> treat<00:05:59.350> with

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
correctly diagnose and to treat with

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.410 
correctly diagnose and to treat with
within<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.250> standard<00:06:01.700> of<00:06:01.790> care<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.240> actually

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
within the standard of care and actually

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.880 
within the standard of care and actually
we<00:06:02.720> expect<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.170> little<00:06:03.290> bit<00:06:03.380> more<00:06:03.470> than<00:06:03.800> the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
we expect a little bit more than the

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.540 
we expect a little bit more than the
standard<00:06:04.280> of<00:06:04.310> care<00:06:04.580> people<00:06:05.330> understand<00:06:05.930> that

standard of care people understand that

standard of care people understand that
when<00:06:07.550> they<00:06:07.670> come<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.090> Sentara<00:06:08.630> physician

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
when they come to a Sentara physician

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.780 
when they come to a Sentara physician
they're<00:06:09.740> gonna<00:06:09.860> see<00:06:10.130> somebody<00:06:10.370> who<00:06:10.760> is
