of<00:02:16.799> chaos<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.280> chosen<00:02:17.580> warriors<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.510> guess<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
of chaos is chosen warriors I guess that

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.240 
of chaos is chosen warriors I guess that
means<00:02:19.200> we'll<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> fight<00:02:19.950> each<00:02:19.980> other

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
eventually I guess so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.660 
eventually I guess so
I<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.410> if<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.920> bring<00:02:26.069> myself<00:02:26.340> to
