00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.050 
to each V pipe that would be the X vent
design<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.310> does<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.880> it

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
design and what this does is that it

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.240 
design and what this does is that it
creates<00:04:21.380> low-pressure<00:04:22.380> channels<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.070> pull

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
creates low-pressure channels that pull

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.980

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
spread evenly across the fins and both

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.750 
spread evenly across the fins and both
of<00:04:35.170> them<00:04:35.500> work<00:04:35.620> together<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.980> suppose<00:04:36.340> just<00:04:36.700> for

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
of them work together I suppose just for

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.910 
of them work together I suppose just for
faster<00:04:37.450> cooling<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.230> gotta<00:04:38.440> say<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:38.860> a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
faster cooling and I gotta say it's a

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.800 
faster cooling and I gotta say it's a
pretty<00:04:39.160> neat<00:04:39.430> layout<00:04:39.790> here's<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.390> closer<00:04:40.630> look

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
pretty neat layout here's a closer look

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.660 
pretty neat layout here's a closer look
at<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.050> base<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.440> cooler<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.100> sometimes

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
at the base of the cooler and sometimes

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.100 
at the base of the cooler and sometimes
you'll<00:04:42.790> get<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.910> base<00:04:43.120> connected<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.930> heat

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
you'll get a base connected to the heat

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.290 
you'll get a base connected to the heat
pipes<00:04:44.380> but<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.920> heat<00:04:45.370> pipes<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:45.970> unit

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
pipes but the heat pipes on this unit

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.600 
pipes but the heat pipes on this unit
make<00:04:46.480> up<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.750> majority<00:04:47.260> of<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:48.040> base<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.490> it's

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
make up the majority of the base so it's

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.970 
make up the majority of the base so it's
like<00:04:48.730> directly<00:04:49.420> connected<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.500> that's<00:04:50.800> where

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
like directly connected and that's where

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.000 
like directly connected and that's where
the<00:04:51.070> name<00:04:51.220> comes<00:04:51.490> from<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.620> supposed

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
the name comes from and this is supposed

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.590 
the name comes from and this is supposed
to<00:04:54.220> improve<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.000> surface-to-surface

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
to improve the surface-to-surface

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.290 
to improve the surface-to-surface
thermal<00:04:56.500> transfer<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.370> here's<00:04:57.670> a<00:04:57.730> look<00:04:58.030> at

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
thermal transfer and here's a look at

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.860 
thermal transfer and here's a look at
the<00:04:59.080> copper<00:05:00.070> base<00:05:00.280> there<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.480> now<00:05:01.780> I'm

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
the copper base there it is now I'm

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.980 
the copper base there it is now I'm
gonna<00:05:01.990> replace<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.220> as<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.400> can<00:05:03.490> tell

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
gonna replace that and as you can tell

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.250 
gonna replace that and as you can tell
the<00:05:05.490> heat<00:05:06.490> pipes<00:05:06.790> thread<00:05:07.270> through<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:08.110> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
that ex fence system as you can tell and
