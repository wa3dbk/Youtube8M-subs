00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.120
 so hi to all those nice morning prizes 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.000
 I will introduce you to how to make a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.690
 front machine as it will make a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 little tutorial on the portal that is there 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 but the machine is the portal does not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 come not from me but just the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.519
 reproduce so here is the machine to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.789
 sell how does it work it works 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.750
 with sand that's good 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 I realize you put the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 sands and your object will go out there it goes 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.620
 maybe find too many holes age 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.660
 not where they were going to put here and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 there you see the lever he is there she 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 discover so to make this machine 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:57.090
 we have to dig like that we have 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 maybe too close to hold tomorrow in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 Minecraft 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 I will show you how to make 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:10.670
 arm machines so here you go 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 dig like that 2 3 and there you go 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 do 1 3 to do 1 2 3 of 3 2 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.229
 bartering on TV is still a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 thickness here so next next to your 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.100
 find the causes still of sy put 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.030
 a torch or whether or 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 whether it is on the edge and beside the hole 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 college and margins more shocking blog 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.880
 after that there you add dollar is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.119
 stable 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.890
 Once must there must be objects 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.490
 who will be the ones who are under hand by 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.140
 anathema on my bar 10 themes 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 then you put a torch that gets 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.409
 find here 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:05.570
 not a task here and a teuf here you 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:12.020
 put red stone repeater here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.320
 a piston that will engage itself and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.820
 there you dig ball little bit there 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.910
 do not need much and normally the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.060
 savate at the cheap 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.980
 So here I go back to you a little 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.360
 the system you see here he is wrong also 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.670
 that all operators are regulated at 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.239
 1 so I do not know why it should be 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.630
 do like that so a torch 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:47.600
 the repeater the red stone there the two 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:50.989
 tubes the piston the torch and the last 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.690
 has better so normally if you have 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.350
 all done well you will be able to pose a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.930
 dispense people there and but all that 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.010
 you want in the dispensary 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.260
 yes I put earth here's what 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.330
 just me you put the cube of a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.100
 trouble you did is there is this 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 because I put on the wrong side 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.840
 that although the dispatcher is at 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.750
 on top of the torch bulls that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 you asked about the middle crime of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.410
 of the machine for that why for 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.410
 that they can activate 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.950
 ah yes because there is nothing he wanted 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.350
 now you put something in 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.079
 you normally do it 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 here and here is your cube here it is 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.600
 after if you do not want against all that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.040
 the material you close it the color that 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.040
 we wanted to put in james 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.530
 here after brown we will close like 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.660
 that the theme will automatically switch to 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.840
 through the block because they do not know 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.840
 not 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:12.000
 here is close on this fact and as you 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.849
 want around just have to be able to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.169
 not access in your machine so 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:21.690
 stranded it's a blog just to put 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.090
 the sand here and there your blog 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.300
 feel me here 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.990
 and normally it works 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.169
 so here it was an island where look pretty 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 who made you a little video for 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.849
 show how to make my machine 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.180
 I'm going to make this momentum of the video with 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.039
 my friend the bright or 31 for you 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.960
 present a server in which one 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.889
 was looking for the reds against the blues 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.570
 it will be called craft of duty 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.280
 Normally I will be under the kit 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.099
 normally if we can install it 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.820
 with the economy perhaps or with its 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.310
 German machines 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.720
 thank you for watching me and subscribe 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.470
 you if you want if you do not have 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.300
 understood something 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.080
 leave a comment that I 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 will answer with
