the price a lot of robot vacuums we've

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.670 
the price a lot of robot vacuums we've
tested<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.300> pretty<00:00:21.300> basic<00:00:21.900> functionality

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
tested have pretty basic functionality

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560 
tested have pretty basic functionality
they<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.519> know<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> spot<00:00:24.000> cleaning<00:00:24.359> mode

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and a regular cleaning mode and that's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.960 
and a regular cleaning mode and that's
about<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
about it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.419 
about it
instead<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> robot<00:00:28.500> vacuum<00:00:28.890> goes<00:00:29.099> way

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
instead this robot vacuum goes way

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
instead this robot vacuum goes way
beyond<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> they<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> max<00:00:30.779> cleaning

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
beyond that they have a max cleaning

mode a regular mode a mop mode all kinds
of<00:00:35.309> special<00:00:35.640> features<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.809> makes<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of special features and that makes it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
of special features and that makes it
really<00:00:37.260> cool<00:00:37.559> also<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.370> terms<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.670> features<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
really cool also in terms of features it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
really cool also in terms of features it
has<00:00:39.360> two<00:00:39.570> side<00:00:39.780> brushes<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.800> than

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
has two side brushes which is more than

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.779 
has two side brushes which is more than
neato<00:00:41.489> bot<00:00:41.760> bag<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.300> AI<00:00:42.329> robots<00:00:42.960> Roomba<00:00:43.440> brand

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
neato bot bag or AI robots Roomba brand

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.100 
neato bot bag or AI robots Roomba brand
but<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> mop<00:00:45.840> feature

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
but I really think that the mop feature

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110 
but I really think that the mop feature
stands<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> most<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> robot

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
stands out the most it's really a robot

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
stands out the most it's really a robot
vacuum<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> special<00:00:49.500> feature

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
vacuum but it has the special feature

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
vacuum but it has the special feature
that<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.129> lot<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.430> robot<00:00:50.730> vacuums<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that a lot of robot vacuums don't you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
that a lot of robot vacuums don't you
can<00:00:52.260> use<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.620> microfiber<00:00:53.129> cloth<00:00:53.550> dry<00:00:54.059> for

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
can use this microfiber cloth dry for

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.990 
can use this microfiber cloth dry for
dusting<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.379> floor<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.430> wet<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
dusting the floor or you can wet it and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
dusting the floor or you can wet it and
use<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> mop<00:00:58.320> unfortunately<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
use it kind of as a mop unfortunately it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.160 
use it kind of as a mop unfortunately it
doesn't<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.000> water<00:01:00.270> reservoir<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.050> it's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
doesn't have a water reservoir so it's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.439 
doesn't have a water reservoir so it's
not<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.530> full-fledged<00:01:02.039> mop<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> get

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
not a full-fledged mop but it can get

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.679 
not a full-fledged mop but it can get
kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> basic<00:01:04.860> maintenance<00:01:05.330> with<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.479> those

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
kind of basic maintenance with all those

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.820 
kind of basic maintenance with all those
features<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.170> had<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.560> high

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
features I had some pretty high

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.700 
features I had some pretty high
expectations<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.909> robot<00:01:09.299> vacuum

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
expectations for this robot vacuum

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.810 
expectations for this robot vacuum
unfortunately<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.920> didn't<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.400> well<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
unfortunately it didn't do very well in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
unfortunately it didn't do very well in
our<00:01:11.970> performance<00:01:12.479> tests<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.890> scored

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
our performance tests it actually scored

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.440 
our performance tests it actually scored
the<00:01:14.250> lowest<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> three

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the lowest in two out of the three

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
the lowest in two out of the three
categories<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.259> tested<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.369> better<00:01:17.700> than

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
categories we tested it did better than

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.510 
categories we tested it did better than
the<00:01:18.030> infinite<00:01:18.600> Ahava<00:01:19.020> 5/10<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.860> pet<00:01:20.100> hair<00:01:20.310> but

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the infinite Ahava 5/10 on pet hair but

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
the infinite Ahava 5/10 on pet hair but
that's<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> 510<00:01:22.049> wasn't<00:01:22.439> able

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that's just because the 510 wasn't able

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
that's just because the 510 wasn't able
to<00:01:22.680> pick<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.250> pet<00:01:23.520> hair<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:24.509> far<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.869> its

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to pick up any pet hair as far as its

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.859 
to pick up any pet hair as far as its
mop<00:01:25.200> capabilities<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.509> tend<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
mop capabilities it did okay we tend to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
mop capabilities it did okay we tend to
push<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> limits<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
push it to the limits a little bit so I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
push it to the limits a little bit so I
spilled<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> good<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> coffee<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> wet

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
spilled a good bit of coffee for the wet

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230 
spilled a good bit of coffee for the wet
test<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> sort<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.850> spread<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
test and it sort of just spread it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
test and it sort of just spread it
around<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.659> room<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.619> sticky

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
around the room and got really a sticky

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
around the room and got really a sticky
coating<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.880> coffee<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> creamer

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
coating of coffee and creamer

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.620 
coating of coffee and creamer
on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.470> floor<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.640> dry<00:01:38.850> mop<00:01:39.090> test<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
on the floor for the dry mop test I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
on the floor for the dry mop test I
spread<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> bunch<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> cornstarch<00:01:40.740> around<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
spread a bunch of cornstarch around and

spread a bunch of cornstarch around and
it<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.210> pushed<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:42.990> corners

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it kind of just pushed it to the corners

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
it kind of just pushed it to the corners
I<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:44.159> wet<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> microfiber<00:01:44.880> cloth<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I also wet the microfiber cloth and I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060 
I also wet the microfiber cloth and I
did<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.079> better<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
did a little bit better but this is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.910 
did a little bit better but this is
really<00:01:47.280> best<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.210> low<00:01:48.899> maintenance<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
really best for low maintenance if the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.319 
really best for low maintenance if the
floor<00:01:50.130> looks<00:01:50.369> clean<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.119> needs<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
floor looks clean but just needs a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.670 
floor looks clean but just needs a
little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> tidying<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.560> would

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
little bit of tidying up this would

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.340 
little bit of tidying up this would
probably<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.399> okay<00:01:53.970> job<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.930> actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
probably do an okay job it's actually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
probably do an okay job it's actually
pretty<00:01:55.560> similar<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> terms<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.430> features<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
pretty similar in terms of features to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.039 
pretty similar in terms of features to
the<00:01:57.270> manual<00:01:57.869> Rytas<00:01:58.590> h<00:01:58.969> 67<00:01:59.969> pro<00:02:00.240> we'll<00:02:00.930> be

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the manual Rytas h 67 pro we'll be

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.780 
the manual Rytas h 67 pro we'll be
testing<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.439> next<00:02:01.860> week<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.189> stay<00:02:02.399> tuned<00:02:02.610> for

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
testing that next week so stay tuned for

testing that next week so stay tuned for
our<00:02:02.880> review<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.899> overall<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.320> wouldn't<00:02:04.770> really

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
our review so overall I wouldn't really

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
our review so overall I wouldn't really
recommend<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.490> robot<00:02:05.759> vacuum<00:02:06.180> even<00:02:06.509> though

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
recommend this robot vacuum even though

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.300 
recommend this robot vacuum even though
it<00:02:06.750> has<00:02:06.869> a

it has a

it has a
