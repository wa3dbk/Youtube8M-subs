00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello to all today a video a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.080
 little bit exceptional because it is 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.890
 a little bit done we'll say to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840
 unexpectedly 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.840
 not that I want to rush things 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.440
 but right now I'm busy enough 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 between the akuma food comb and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 akuma finally brief all of those things 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.850
 very important 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 I miss some time to do some 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.800
 complete videos that being said I 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.429
 wanted to talk about a topic that seems to me 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 important is the difficulty to have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.350
 a gluten-free diet there is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.760
 a few days I was dining with friends 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 and joined the table a neighbor 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 who had enough osteoarthritis 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 pronounced and who wanted to have my opinion 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.510
 regarding a possible surgery that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 offered him his doctor and so I told him 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.270
 asked if she had tried to do 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 things already in relation to its mode 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.239
 of life at the level of his diet 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 some physical activity etc 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 and then my friends have him 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.719
 suggested to try a diet 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.360
 without dairy products and I have 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.369
 added and also gluten-free to make 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.119
 the test alas this person responded 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.830
 immediately in the name without gluten it's 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.280
 Too complicated I want to do 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 pleasure 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 so that's something you have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 already heard probably if you have 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.450
 tried to talk about feeding without 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.100
 gluten to someone around you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 but it may also be something 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.310
 that you even think 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810
 and that actually be an obstacle to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.700
 try a gluten-free diet 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.909
 even before we know if we will draw 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.100
 profits or not so that made me 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.140
 think a little bit of the reason for 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.460
 which is what we heard if 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.429
 often this sentence and I think that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.119
 it's just a form of 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.149
 conditioning 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.159
 so I explain what is a small 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.679
 little weird actually is when we say 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.380
 that we put forward the notion of pleasure 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.209
 food and we do not exclude the fact 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.159
 health concept since it's as if 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.649
 the choice was between me 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.909
 pleasure in the kitchen is cons 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.289
 I keep my evidence of health and 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.729
 possibly arms provided they 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.549
 can disappear by changing 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.110
 feeding or so I'm doing 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.599
 efforts his feeding I deprive myself of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.010
 pleasure and I'm better but I have 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.170
 the more the pleasure of feeding there is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.599
 always this choice this duality that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.930
 intervenes out of where does this duality 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.880
 just so well it seems to me that it's 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 a duality that we basically have 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.030
 since since almost always because 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.580
 that when we were children already our 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.210
 parents were telling us well 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.800
 do your job or do this do that 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.290
 be nice to your brother you have hours 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 and tonight you'll have fries and this 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.070
 evening you'll have an ice cream where I sit 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.280
 will give you this to eat and so the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.380
 food has always had a relationship of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.950
 reward a notion of pleasure 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.060
 so we are conditioned somewhere 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.920
 have food in this way 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.170
 we were never taught when we were 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.400
 little in any case not me and I do not think 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.990
 not that it has changed in schools 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720
 that food 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.480
 it was two parameters at once the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.970
 health is also pleasure and that one 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.310
 does not exclude the other and therefore 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.230
 actually to if we are in this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.900
 binary approach it's either good for my 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.150
 good for my health or good for my palate 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.440
 well we 're not actually in the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 good direction and in fact that does not 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.100
 not represent reality it's also 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.230
 something that is maintained 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.090
 today by the industrialists where 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.040
 some certain lobbyists who want 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.340
 we possibly eat more than 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.900
 manufactured products not necessarily 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.120
 good for health but that are good taste 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.950
 to taste and so here we go 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.269
 to feel guilty by saying to the relay is 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.100
 too complicated you will deprive yourself of 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.900
 everything and that's so it's really 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.090
 problematic 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.800
 I think it must eventually be 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.390
 to think especially if we try to 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 change power and we have 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.450
 difficulties to do it 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.190
 to know how free we are at 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920
 how does one is what it is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.300
 we who decide what we want to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.620
 to eat what to eat or is it 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.230
 that it is someone else ie 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.820
 the society that imposed it on us 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.460
 said it was that it was necessary that 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.080
 may be ingested only by 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.150
 this reflection we can succeed in 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.040
 to release and he stands for me 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.800
 actually I eat gluten-free 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 for several years now is 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.410
 no more is a constraint at 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.530
 contrary I find a lot of fun 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.010
 to eat healthy and natural foods 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.780
 naturally gluten-free 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.610
 while it was not necessarily the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.510
 case initially I think like 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.910
 many of you me 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.300
 personally when I returned to 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.789
 the faculty at 18 years old well 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.400
 I ate mainly only 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.720
 pizza cheese bread ice 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.729
 that was really I was eating 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.110
 almost no fruits and vegetables so 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.270
 but it's a lot of young people who are 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.300
 two who are in this situation and 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.830
 then the day I decided to delete 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.940
 the gluten that it is not necessarily of the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.650
 overnight even though I had the 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.509
 will it happen from day to day 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.430
 next day there was a time of adaptation 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.169
 that is to say that at the beginning we eat without 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.879
 gluten and then hop the weekend 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.379
 I do not know we are not good 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.900
 psychologically where we are invited to 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.030
 friends where we have the temptation will say and 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.120
 there we let ourselves go sometimes 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.349
 greatly go and then for those who 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.520
 are sensitive quickly arranges 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.469
 between new symptoms and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.580
 problems but it's something 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.800
 normal and I think it also takes 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.960
 have some indulgence vis-Ã -vis 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.240
 of oneself not necessarily to put oneself 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.340
 the bar too high 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.139
 except for allergy obviously 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.610
 where the slightest ingestion can cause 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.530
 death but in general it's since 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.910
 since childhood or even intolerance 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.710
 gluten or any protein 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.300
 becomes sivola it's more complicated 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.130
 but for others who had 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.020
 pathologies that are sensitive to gluten 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.000
 like gluten sensitivity by 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.250
 example or joint diseases that 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.130
 involve gluten proteins 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.389
 well here we are going to have some 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.590
 still have pain from 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.970
 intermittency make sense of rigor 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.090
 with which we follow this news 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.870
 food method but it's good 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.400
 also to know not to blame 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.930
 overly because we did not succeed 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.370
 right away to make this change 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.710
 because in fact it's a change that 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.949
 is difficult because in my opinion but 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.659
 here he interacted with what we have at 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.639
 deeper we mean everything 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.259
 who is inculcated since childhood the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.139
 company etc 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.150
 so here I hope this video 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.759
 can help you change 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.800
 I take advantage of course 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.090
 obviously in case that you 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.650
 would interest for those seeking 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.810
 information about gluten the 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.939
 gluten-related diseases 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.150
 why gluten is potentially 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.650
 harmful to your health and for whom you 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.389
 can you refer to my gluten book 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.129
 how modern wheat 2h toxic that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:48.270
 also exist in German if you 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.970
 want the iran so much and then 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.010
 and then here on this I tell you more 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.500
 late for a next video 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.500
 when I will have time here is goodbye
