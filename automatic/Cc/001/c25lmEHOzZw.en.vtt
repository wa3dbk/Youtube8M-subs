00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
from piece to piece which one's gonna

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.570 
from piece to piece which one's gonna
work<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.830> sometimes<00:02:04.069> it's<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.399> really

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
work and sometimes it's a really

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.279 
work and sometimes it's a really
pleasant<00:02:04.970> surprise<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:05.599> not<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.869> ones<00:02:06.049> you

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289

pleasant surprise it's not the ones you
assume<00:02:06.770> would<00:02:07.009> work

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.940 

the<00:02:13.730> piano<00:02:14.090> trio<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:15.080> didn't<00:02:15.470> think<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.740> gonna

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the piano trio I didn't think was gonna

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.100 
the piano trio I didn't think was gonna
work<00:02:16.190> when<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.490> was<00:02:16.700> riding<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.750> perfect

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
work when I was riding it it's a perfect

work when I was riding it it's a perfect
example<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:19.540> struggled<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
example I struggled with it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.080 
example I struggled with it
because<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> felt<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.340> couldn't<00:02:22.670> find<00:02:22.910> my

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
because I felt like I couldn't find my

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.400 
because I felt like I couldn't find my
way<00:02:23.270> sometimes<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:23.960> going<00:02:24.200> into<00:02:24.380> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
way sometimes it's like going into a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.870 
way sometimes it's like going into a
dark<00:02:24.620> room<00:02:24.770> with<00:02:25.130> your<00:02:25.220> hands<00:02:25.490> out<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.730> front
