weapon<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> feel<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> little

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
weapon but I feel like it's a little

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
weapon but I feel like it's a little
worse<00:01:04.140> than<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.159> bat<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> feel

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
worse than the bat I don't know I feel

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
worse than the bat I don't know I feel
like<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> bat<00:01:06.479> does<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:06.930> damage<00:01:07.520> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
like the bat does a lot more damage and

like the bat does a lot more damage and
I<00:01:08.640> honestly<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> way<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> bat<00:01:09.840> handles

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I honestly like the way the bat handles

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.010 
I honestly like the way the bat handles
more<00:01:10.680> than<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> golf<00:01:11.220> club<00:01:11.900> one<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.960> my

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
favorite thing about the glove is just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.410 
favorite thing about the glove is just
the<00:01:14.280> overhead<00:01:14.790> ability<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.360> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the overhead ability where I just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
the overhead ability where I just
overhead<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.500> her<00:01:16.619> face<00:01:16.799> just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
completely owned them it's really really
cool<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> fact<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cool and I like the also the fact that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
cool and I like the also the fact that
it<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.560> sometimes<00:01:23.520> launches<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> forward

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it also sometimes launches you forward

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
it also sometimes launches you forward
like<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.900> no<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.340> your

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
like that so no it does it with your

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
like that so no it does it with your
fists<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> swing<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.320> someone

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
fists so if you go to swing at someone
