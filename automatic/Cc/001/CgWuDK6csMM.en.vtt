00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
advantage of a to screen setup like this

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.840 
advantage of a to screen setup like this
but<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:22.980> applications<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
but there are now some applications and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
but there are now some applications and
this<00:00:24.150> device<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> available<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.199> japan<00:00:25.470> and

this device is available in japan and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
this device is available in japan and
some<00:00:25.859> software<00:00:26.670> developers<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.570> come<00:00:27.720> up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
some software developers have come up

some software developers have come up
with<00:00:27.840> apps<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.410> instance<00:00:28.500> we're<00:00:28.830> looking

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
with apps so for instance we're looking

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.150 
with apps so for instance we're looking
at<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.529> presentation<00:00:31.529> application

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
at this is a presentation application

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
at this is a presentation application

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and if you can show me how it works with

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.910 
and if you can show me how it works with
the<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.410> screens<00:00:34.649> working<00:00:35.040> together

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 

so<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.089> top<00:00:39.329> screen<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.870> can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
so in the in the top screen we can

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.509 
so in the in the top screen we can
actually<00:00:40.230> view<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.679> document<00:00:40.859> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> bottom

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
actually view the document in the bottom

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.060 
actually view the document in the bottom
screen<00:00:41.789> when<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.659> can<00:00:42.780> type<00:00:42.960> notes<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:43.949> do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
screen when we can type notes or do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
screen when we can type notes or do
other<00:00:44.159> informations<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> useful<00:00:45.149> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
other informations this is useful in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.730 
other informations this is useful in
business<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> education<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.649> said

window<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.440> video<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> window<00:02:15.250> could

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
window and a video in this window could

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.000 
window and a video in this window could
I<00:02:15.520> do<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.750> yeah<00:02:17.790> each<00:02:19.140> application<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.860> are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
I do that yeah each application we are

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.800 
I do that yeah each application we are
executed<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:22.240> application<00:02:23.430> independent<00:02:24.430> re

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
executed to application independent re

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.520 
executed to application independent re
its<00:02:25.810> bata<00:02:26.380> certain<00:02:27.810> software<00:02:28.810> developer<00:02:29.290> need

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
its bata certain software developer need

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.160 
its bata certain software developer need
a<00:02:29.680> modification<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:31.270> are<00:02:31.450> released<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.900> the

software firm investigate with

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.550 
software firm investigate with
initiatives<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> software<00:02:36.820> vendors<00:02:37.560> some

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
initiatives to the software vendors some

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.479 
initiatives to the software vendors some
modification<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.670> taza<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:41.590> tool

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
modification of taza your tool

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.270 
modification of taza your tool
application<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.660> depends<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.140> execute<00:02:44.650> ok

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
application it depends on the execute ok

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.830 
application it depends on the execute ok
yeah<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.360> version<00:02:46.450> again

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
then I guess later this year you're

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.920 
then I guess later this year you're
gonna<00:02:51.519> make<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.820> yeah<00:02:52.180> yeah<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
gonna make it yeah yeah you're going to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.920 
gonna make it yeah yeah you're going to
make<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.140> thinner<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.680> lighter<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.930> android

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
make it thinner and lighter and android

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.400 
make it thinner and lighter and android
4.0<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:57.519> TI<00:02:58.000> OMAP<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.780> processor<00:02:59.320> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
4.0 and a TI OMAP for processor and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.710 
4.0 and a TI OMAP for processor and
dual<00:03:01.130> core<00:03:01.340> processor<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
dual core processor so this is the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.600 
dual core processor so this is the
version<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.050> we<00:03:03.320> may<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.610> internationally

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
version that we may see internationally

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.030 
version that we may see internationally
sometime<00:03:05.390> later<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:05.720> year<00:03:05.780> maybe<00:03:06.440> this

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
sometime later this year maybe this

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.240 
sometime later this year maybe this
summer<00:03:07.670> summer<00:03:08.480> season<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:09.200> need<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.650> robot

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
summer summer season we need this robot

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.430 
summer summer season we need this robot
man
