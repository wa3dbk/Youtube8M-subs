00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
something that needs to be zero so you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.929 
something that needs to be zero so you
can<00:01:19.259> maintain<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.650> rigidity<00:01:20.070> across<00:01:20.759> the

can maintain that rigidity across the
whole<00:01:21.090> hand<00:01:21.360> guard<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> many<00:01:23.610> things<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
whole hand guard so many things on the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
light rail three the main thing is how

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
light rail three the main thing is how
it<00:01:27.119> mounts<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.110> different

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it mounts up it's a little bit different

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
it mounts up it's a little bit different
than<00:01:28.680> previous<00:01:29.040> models<00:01:29.509> previous<00:01:30.509> models<00:01:30.900> had

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
than previous models previous models had

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.550 
than previous models previous models had
six<00:01:31.950> bolts<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.630> only<00:01:34.320> as

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
six bolts this as you can see only as

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.630 
six bolts this as you can see only as
for<00:01:35.150> if<00:01:36.150> you've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> mounted<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:38.400> know

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
for if you've got a mounted one you know

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
for if you've got a mounted one you know
mountain<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.240> six<00:01:39.600> screws<00:01:40.140> could<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.530> some

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
mountain up six screws could take some

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
mountain up six screws could take some
time<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:42.000> mount<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> rear<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
time they now all mount from the rear so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
time they now all mount from the rear so
that<00:01:43.259> eases<00:01:44.130> installation<00:01:44.880> quite<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> bit

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that eases installation quite a bit

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
that eases installation quite a bit
saves<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> some<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.200> installing<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.100> when

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
saves you some time installing but when

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.340 
saves you some time installing but when
you<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> nine<00:01:48.600> system<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.110> not

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you look at the nine system it's not

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
you look at the nine system it's not
they<00:01:49.799> didn't<00:01:50.009> sacrifice<00:01:50.189> any<00:01:50.640> rigidity<00:01:51.240> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they didn't sacrifice any rigidity on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.810 
they didn't sacrifice any rigidity on

free flow I don't know if I mentioned
that<00:03:54.329> earlier<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.739> entirely<00:03:56.010> free<00:03:56.400> float<00:03:57.049> even

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
that earlier so entirely free float even

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.050 
that earlier so entirely free float even
though<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.169> is<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> quad<00:03:58.829> rail<00:03:59.069> handguard<00:03:59.310> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
though it is a quad rail handguard that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.080 
though it is a quad rail handguard that
is<00:04:00.299> still<00:04:00.599> as<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.380> name<00:04:01.680> implies<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:03.030> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
is still as the name implies it is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.099 
is still as the name implies it is
lightweight<00:04:05.030> along<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.510> handguard

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
lightweight along with the handguard

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.629 
lightweight along with the handguard
itself<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:08.160> do<00:04:08.310> get<00:04:08.519> three<00:04:08.970> rail<00:04:09.630> covers<00:04:10.049> so

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
itself you do get three rail covers so

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.830 
itself you do get three rail covers so
you're<00:04:11.639> not<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.790> totally<00:04:12.329> grading<00:04:12.720> your

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
hands on all the rails even though they

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.060 
hands on all the rails even though they
all<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.680> deboard<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.599> for<00:04:18.599> full<00:04:19.560> picatinny

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
