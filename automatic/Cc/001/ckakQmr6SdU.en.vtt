important to me that the conclusion of
my<00:01:25.700> degree<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.180> definitely<00:01:26.630> want<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.830> a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
my degree I definitely want to have a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.580 
my degree I definitely want to have a
strong<00:01:28.729> degree<00:01:29.030> program<00:01:29.539> that<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.869> can<00:01:30.140> take

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
strong degree program that I can take

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.749 
strong degree program that I can take
anywhere<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.369> world

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
anywhere in the world

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.060 
anywhere in the world
I<00:01:31.910> think<00:01:32.780> economics<00:01:33.229> graduates<00:01:33.619> are<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:33.890> such

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
I think economics graduates are in such

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.620 
I think economics graduates are in such
high<00:01:34.220> demand<00:01:34.250> firstly<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:35.330> they<00:01:35.479> have

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
high demand firstly because they have

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.480 
high demand firstly because they have
the<00:01:35.780> skills<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.259> allow<00:01:36.560> them<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.800> really

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the skills that allow them to really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.040 
the skills that allow them to really
analyze<00:01:37.670> problems<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.660> in<00:01:38.750> addition

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
analyze problems and in addition

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.719 
analyze problems and in addition
Adelaide<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.619> one<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.920> only<00:01:40.070> universities

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
Adelaide is one of the only universities

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.430 
Adelaide is one of the only universities
in<00:01:41.240> Australia<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> offer<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.050> economics

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
in Australia to offer the economics

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:53.919 
in Australia to offer the economics
degree<00:01:44.440> much<00:01:45.440> more<00:01:45.649> over<00:01:45.890> time

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.940 

economics<00:01:54.929> complements<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.619> any<00:01:55.770> other

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
economics complements really any other

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
economics complements really any other
degree<00:01:56.219> program<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:56.999> broadens<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
degree program it really broadens the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.240 
degree program it really broadens the
skill<00:01:58.109> base<00:01:58.319> oh<00:02:03.170> yeah<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.039> one<00:02:05.219> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
skill base oh yeah that that is one of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
skill base oh yeah that that is one of
the<00:02:05.460> advantages<00:02:06.359> of<00:02:07.039> economics<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the advantages of economics is it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
the advantages of economics is it
develops<00:02:09.239> an<00:02:09.420> independent<00:02:10.019> yet

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
develops an independent yet

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.890 
develops an independent yet

whereas<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.670> economics<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.360> about

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
whereas with economics it's about

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.979 
whereas with economics it's about

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the first year courses really do bridge

the first year courses really do bridge
the<00:02:37.379> gap<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.670> advantage<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> choosing

the gap but the advantage of choosing

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.600 
the gap but the advantage of choosing
economics<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.920> reasons<00:02:41.220> why<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
economics and one of the reasons why I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.699 
economics and one of the reasons why I
chose<00:02:41.640> economics<00:02:42.209> was<00:02:42.690> wasn't<00:02:43.470> quite<00:02:43.680> sure

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
chose economics was wasn't quite sure

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.309 
chose economics was wasn't quite sure
and<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.940> starting<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.569> economics<00:02:46.109> meant

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and and starting with economics meant

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.520 
and and starting with economics meant
that<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.549> program<00:02:48.000> where<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.109> wouldn't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that I was in a program where I wouldn't

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.809 
that I was in a program where I wouldn't
have<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.739> choose<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.010> there<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.519> then<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
have to choose right there and then I

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.119 
have to choose right there and then I
would<00:02:50.910> sort<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.329> try<00:02:52.079> before<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.470> buy<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.950> had

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
would sort of try before you buy I had

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.099 
would sort of try before you buy I had
the<00:02:53.250> option<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.730> getting<00:02:54.390> into<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> program

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
the option of getting into the program

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.949 
the option of getting into the program
and<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:56.310> being<00:02:56.640> able<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.940> make<00:02:57.269> decisions<00:02:57.840> of

company if you can look at the bigger

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.890 
company if you can look at the bigger
picture<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.030> you're<00:03:59.150> not<00:03:59.269> just<00:03:59.480> lost<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.840> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
number-crunching and that's what

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.930 
number-crunching and that's what
economics<00:04:02.330> does

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.640 

I<00:04:05.030> guess<00:04:05.660> when<00:04:05.840> you're<00:04:05.990> you<00:04:06.350> know<00:04:06.440> when<00:04:06.590> you're

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
I guess when you're you know when you're

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.260 
I guess when you're you know when you're
you<00:04:07.070> just<00:04:07.100> about<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.580> graduate<00:04:07.760> from<00:04:08.030> high

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
you just about to graduate from high

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.720 
you just about to graduate from high
school<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.660> don't<00:04:08.690> really<00:04:08.980> know<00:04:09.980> where<00:04:10.610> you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
school you don't really know where you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.940

choosing well you know where to go from

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.240 
choosing well you know where to go from
there<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:26.380> engineering<00:04:27.380> was<00:04:27.470> my<00:04:27.650> primary

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
there and engineering was my primary

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.610 
there and engineering was my primary
choice<00:04:28.490> but<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.270> also<00:04:29.660> wanted<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.170> keep<00:04:30.410> my

by competent and why economics in

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.420 
by competent and why economics in
particular<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.770> know<00:04:36.860> over<00:04:37.160> other

options such as business or finance is I
wanted<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.140> wanted<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:43.400> degree<00:04:43.700> program<00:04:43.940> that

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
wanted I wanted a degree program that

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.480 
wanted I wanted a degree program that
was<00:04:44.660> versatile<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.440> strong<00:04:45.860> degree<00:04:46.130> program

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
was versatile a strong degree program

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.100 
was versatile a strong degree program
but<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.730> was<00:04:47.030> versatile<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.900> was
