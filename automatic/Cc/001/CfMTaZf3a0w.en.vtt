00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
jumping on top of so once you're on top

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.030 
jumping on top of so once you're on top
of<00:01:27.810> their<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> roundel<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.619> should<00:01:28.829> start

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of their the roundel it should start

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.020 
of their the roundel it should start
again<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> should<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
again you should probably be in like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
again you should probably be in like
round<00:01:30.240> three<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.509> something<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
round three or something doing this and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.319 
round three or something doing this and
then<00:01:32.369> you'll<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> design<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:32.970> come<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
then you'll get a design we come to the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
then you'll get a design we come to the
window<00:01:33.450> once<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.229> tears<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.740> bottom

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
window once he tears off that bottom
