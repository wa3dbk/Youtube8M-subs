00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.370
 both a small view of people 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 throw that is the Scandinavian 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.580
 competitor here in germany 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.900
 just his beta test starts in the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 first users were invited 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 have here the universal application 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 installed on the iphone throw one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 short first look on it and I want 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.080
 show we just start with the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.210
 Application people is similar to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.740
 Saturn service of live streaming too 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 different tv program 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.759
 offers the selection is currently still 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.100
 very limited are now zdf rtl rtl 2 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 vox super rtl n-tv and then it stops too 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.489
 already on actions are still a few 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 retailers such as dmax and eurosport 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 limited on the whole, 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.829
 the mentioned on the block 6 the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.309
 application has such a small 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.590
 unique feature with the im 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.149
 the apron was thrown very great and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 Although the possibility not only live 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.199
 streams but also that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 last week's last program 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 to consume again so if 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.270
 I say here on Wednesdays I have xy 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.399
 then I can actually miss 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 jump back to wednesday and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 check the show again 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 if we look at this but here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.240
 inside the app we'll see the same 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.159
 since it is grayed out a lot and only 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 down here at eurosport and dmax 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.760
 we still have the possibility of old programs 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.409
 to look 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.210
 which is perhaps is it the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 beta-phase maybe the transmitters have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 I consent to that as well 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.520
 their content of the last seven days 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 can be retrieved 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 currently as I said limited 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.799
 down here on the three Sparsenender 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.780
 eurosport dmax and nick the application 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.140
 we structured relatively simply 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.060
 here once this timeline in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.560
 we'll show you what they are 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 what's going on we can see 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 how far is the progress in the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.720
 program and if I am here now 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 sender out again I'll take it too 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.350
 because of me eurosport cycling then 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.820
 takes a second 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 it starts and shows us this 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.500
 support program 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.520
 the possibility that anybody airplay 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.870
 to overlook here on the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.610
 volume and have influence 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.560
 below usually also the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 possibility me here in the stream out and 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.960
 to move such a small one 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 Timeline in it 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 but this only works if you 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.810
 archive broadcast looks and not if you 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 older the live program looks at 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.930
 settings are limited to three 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.250
 different views for the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.959
 current program we have here once 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.640
 the channel kit where and when the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.260
 shows individual channels and says something 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.910
 currently running with a small picture in it 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.620
 we have the partial that we just got 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.570
 just saw and so kind 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.800
 again a bit more detailed tv guide 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.540
 where we then send from sender to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.480
 can mix and see what's going on 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.370
 just what then in the settings drinne 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.110
 me a lot of settings there 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.160
 the possibility to activate audio only 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.410
 then you can put the iphone in your pocket 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.209
 stuck and distributed only the soundtrack of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.820
 current tv broadcast we have one 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.230
 rocker in there too yes that was it in the big one 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.400
 and all over here is one more 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.110
 calendar can then be the week 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.970
 Jump back brings us but right now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.959
 Not very much because a beaver earlier 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.930
 already said there are only three 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.120
 stations that support the whole 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.230
 model is also clear so far a thing 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.549
 maybe we should show it for a moment 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:06.329
 where was that inside is my head now 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:08.680
 would have given me a second 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.299
 zeitgeist support namely there is the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.459
 possibility within the application if 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.500
 We look something hello 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.600
 germany that we choose 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.950
 can on which device the whole thing 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.820
 I'm just going to find that 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.140
 button no longer 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.519
 These are the airplay settings here 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.110
 is it right there you can get one 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.700
 add different devices and 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.900
 because of me also say I want that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.570
 not again from but also on 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.130
 look at my mac then if you have one 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.209
 adds new device goes in here so 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.910
 Camera search 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.070
 I can the time now filming 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.660
 a qr-code and then the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.310
 picture also directly in the browser window 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.750
 be consumed openly mac 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.100
 a bit too bad because there is one more 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.290
 extra plugin needs to be installed 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.640
 the whole drm story i can do that 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.049
 devices if here again throw out the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 I have linked but it makes sense 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.220
 I think if you have a tv 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.900
 has the in 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.010
 then you will have the browser 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.170
 whole thing on the tv 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.590
 Can throw now without an apple tv 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.690
 to be instructed for this mirroring 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.250
 video transfer and large, is that 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.930
 the match an offer as it is now 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.870
 currently available in the beta version 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.660
 As I said in Germany just now 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.790
 has just started little transmitter yet 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.739
 not yet all transmitters allow 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.530
 this spring back to the last one 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.900
 week looks so far quite nice from the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.940
 beta testers only three months to the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.560
 to try everything and we 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.240
 then tell us again and 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.650
 describe if maybe still 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.650
 has improved somewhat finland
