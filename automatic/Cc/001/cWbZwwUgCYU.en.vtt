00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
so it's very simple actually

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.420 
so it's very simple actually
but<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> lot<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.320> people<00:00:19.590> don't<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> do

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
but a lot of people don't know how to do
this<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:20.880> them<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.539> case<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
this they take them out of the case and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.120 
this they take them out of the case and
they<00:00:22.020> say<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> heck<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:23.010> them

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
without the microphone of course so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
without the microphone of course so
that's<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.989> wrap

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

that's going to go there then you wrap
the<00:00:55.500> other<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> remote<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the other one with the remote and the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
the other one with the remote and the
microphone<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> place<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
microphone there and you place that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
microphone there and you place that
right<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.550> top<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
right on top of that you want to get it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.380 
right on top of that you want to get it
all<00:01:01.350> nice<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.680> neat<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.359> ahead

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
all nice and neat then you just go ahead

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.560 
all nice and neat then you just go ahead
and<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.960> cords<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.589> simply<00:01:05.220> start

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
and take your cords and simply start

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
and take your cords and simply start
running<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.689> around<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.340> tricky<00:01:08.700> parts

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
running them around and the tricky parts

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
running them around and the tricky parts
out<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.600> unless<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.590> cord

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
out of the way unless you get your cord

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.300 
out of the way unless you get your cord
tangled<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.680> said<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> tricky

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
tangled up but like I said the tricky

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
tangled up but like I said the tricky
parts<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
parts all the way from there and you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.460 
parts all the way from there and you
just<00:01:16.890> continue<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.520> run<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> around<00:01:18.840> making

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
just continue to run that around making

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
just continue to run that around making
sure<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.100> flat<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> even<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.060> possible

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
sure it's as flat and even as possible

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
sure it's as flat and even as possible
and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> try<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:22.979> distribute<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and you want to try and distribute the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.179 
and you want to try and distribute the
rope<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> different<00:01:24.780> layers<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.439> as

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
rope to the different layers there as

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
rope to the different layers there as
you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.000> don't<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> bump<00:01:28.020> too

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you can see you don't want to bump too

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
you can see you don't want to bump too
much<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.890> it'll<00:01:29.369> bulk<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:30.210> much

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
much because it'll bulk out too much

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.830 
much because it'll bulk out too much
when<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> try<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> cap<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.840> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
when you try and get the cap on so go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
when you try and get the cap on so go
ahead<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.290> keep<00:01:35.869> lining<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:40.610> then

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
ahead and just keep lining it up then

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.690 
ahead and just keep lining it up then
the<00:01:42.390> last<00:01:42.689> trick<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> end

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the last trick when you get to the end

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.569 
the last trick when you get to the end
is<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.750> tuck<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
is to tuck this in and if you do it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.330 
is to tuck this in and if you do it
right<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.060> should<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.840> about<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.500> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
right it should be just about there for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.880 
right it should be just about there for
the<00:01:50.490> edge<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> even<00:01:52.439> bring<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the edge of it and you can even bring it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
the edge of it and you can even bring it
back<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:54.439> but<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> don't

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
back just a little bit but you don't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
back just a little bit but you don't
like<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> said<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.549> want<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.850> bulking

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
like I said you don't want it bulking

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.569 
like I said you don't want it bulking
out<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.310> cap

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
out at all then you just take your cap

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.020 
out at all then you just take your cap
and<00:02:00.149> should<00:02:00.689> fit<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> there<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.030> then

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and should fit right on there and then
