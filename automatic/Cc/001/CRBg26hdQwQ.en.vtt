00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 is which 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 [Music] 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.490
 Well, today I'm going to make the video of 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.240
 how to make dough for tortillas 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.180
 This is very easy 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.000
 I am going to use this brand that is very 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.010
 known but there are others so what 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 what I 'm going to do here is going to be follow 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.750
 the instructions of the bag or the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.730
 manufacturer sometimes every brand is 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.450
 different so for this I'm going to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.450
 use salt 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.060
 Water 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.270
 and this is optional I'm going to add a 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.570
 little royal or baking powder 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.600
 because it gives a softer consistency 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.660
 does not crack so much that a friend 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.460
 gave me this advice and then I did it and in 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.829
 truth is that yes it worked well let's 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.039
 start 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.789
 adding the two cups of flour I'm going to 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.540
 put just a little bit of royal and as 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.699
 come here almost the tip of the spoon 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.820
 the salt that is a quarter teaspoon 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.600
 and the rate a quarter of water and I'm going to 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.600
 start stirring 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.110
 good as you can see here this was 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.180
 very quartered as I still do not know 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.640
 mix very well I will add a 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.350
 little more water you can do 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 the same but the recommendations of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.980
 heat they have little by little so they do not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 it is watered down ok and if it is that they get to 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.770
 spend can add a little more 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.040
 flour and so on until they are left 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.830
 completely mixed very hard or very 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 watery 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.260
 and well then finally that's how the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.990
 mix perfectly should not be left 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.299
 no flour 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 and as you can see if I put my hand and no 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.210
 nothing hits me then that wants 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.549
 say that it is ready and well then 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.860
 from simple we made the dough to make 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.520
 the tortillas good this is a request 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.729
 of the long leila and baby they asked 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.289
 how do I make the dough for the tortilla and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.050
 Well, if you live in Mexico, you can 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.269
 buy the dough the tortillerÃ­a and if not 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.420
 you can use this option which is 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.459
 would be the instant masses there 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.459
 different brands but the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.090
 recommendations that do not confuse the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.910
 dough for tortillas to the dough to make 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.000
 tamales because they are very different things 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.560
 and well, this is all I hope 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.830
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 video 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.959
 I do not understand
