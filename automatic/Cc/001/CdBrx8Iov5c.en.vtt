00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
more like something that I typically

of spin on my forehands and backhands on

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.130 
of spin on my forehands and backhands on
volleys<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:17.880> good<00:01:17.970> pop<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.960> was

volleys that had very good pop and I was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.930 
volleys that had very good pop and I was
able<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.440> keep<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> ball<00:01:19.980> deep<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> keep<00:01:20.790> my

serves with a heavier weight and open
pattern<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.390> able<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.720> generate<00:01:28.080> lots<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
pattern I was able to generate lots of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.430 
pattern I was able to generate lots of
spin<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.760> accuracy<00:01:30.270> well<00:01:30.960> those<00:01:31.290> were

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
spin and good accuracy well those were

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.140 
spin and good accuracy well those were
my<00:01:31.590> thoughts<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.160> racket<00:01:32.550> let's<00:01:33.030> get

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
my thoughts about the racket let's get

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.180 
my thoughts about the racket let's get
another<00:01:33.420> opinion<00:01:33.680> philippa<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
another opinion philippa what do you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.850 
another opinion philippa what do you
think<00:01:35.430> thanks<00:01:36.240> Orman<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:37.350> let's<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:37.830> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
think thanks Orman well let's see how I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
think thanks Orman well let's see how I
did<00:01:38.160> on<00:01:38.190> court<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.480> is<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.840> heavier<00:01:40.110> than

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
did on court this is much heavier than

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.070 
did on court this is much heavier than
the<00:01:40.650> x-force<00:01:41.190> once<00:01:41.910> again<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.450> had<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.870> create

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
the x-force once again I had to create

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.710 
the x-force once again I had to create
my<00:01:43.290> own<00:01:43.320> power<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.340> yet<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> precision<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.330> my

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
my own power but yet the precision on my

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
my own power but yet the precision on my
strokes<00:01:46.050> was<00:01:46.260> great<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.460> did<00:01:47.730> feel<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.420> my

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
strokes was great it did feel good in my

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500 
strokes was great it did feel good in my
hand<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.320> easy<00:01:49.620> follow<00:01:50.010> through<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.300> bass
