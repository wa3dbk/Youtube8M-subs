therapist or two or three and this is in

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.430 
therapist or two or three and this is in
my<00:04:13.720> idea<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.970> situation<00:04:16.750> we<00:04:16.840> cannot<00:04:17.109> accept

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
my idea a situation we cannot accept

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.890 
my idea a situation we cannot accept
because<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:18.299> well-trained<00:04:19.299> horse<00:04:19.450> doesn't

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
because a well-trained horse doesn't

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.469 
because a well-trained horse doesn't
need<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> therapist<00:04:21.360> we<00:04:22.469> we<00:04:23.469> know<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:24.479> stiff

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
need a therapist we we know that stiff

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.720 
need a therapist we we know that stiff
horse<00:04:25.950> will<00:04:26.950> break<00:04:27.190> down

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
horse will break down

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.960 
horse will break down
sooner<00:04:28.270> or<00:04:28.300> later<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:29.070> stiff<00:04:30.070> horse<00:04:30.420> will<00:04:31.420> get

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
sooner or later a stiff horse will get

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.210 
sooner or later a stiff horse will get
mental<00:04:33.970> damage<00:04:34.300> physical<00:04:35.290> damage<00:04:35.620> for

mental damage physical damage for

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.720 
mental damage physical damage for
example<00:04:36.510> suspensory<00:04:37.510> problems<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.730> in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
example suspensory problems and in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.630 
example suspensory problems and in
extreme<00:04:40.090> cases<00:04:40.270> sometimes<00:04:41.110> they<00:04:41.710> really<00:04:42.280> die

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
extreme cases sometimes they really die

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.260 
extreme cases sometimes they really die
of<00:04:43.510> stress<00:04:43.840> or<00:04:44.200> whatever<00:04:44.680> factors<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.430> this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
of stress or whatever factors and this

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.320 
of stress or whatever factors and this
is<00:04:46.480> not<00:04:46.690> what<00:04:47.380> good<00:04:47.650> horseman<00:04:48.040> can<00:04:48.730> accept<00:04:49.090> in

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
is not what good horseman can accept in

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.650 
is not what good horseman can accept in
in<00:04:50.230> future<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.670> we<00:04:52.000> have<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.480> make<00:04:52.630> a

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
in future so we have to make a

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.170 
in future so we have to make a
