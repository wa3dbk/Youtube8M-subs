that'll<00:02:47.329> be<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.630> more<00:02:47.780> powerful<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.709> two

that'll be the more powerful of the two

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.180 
that'll be the more powerful of the two
and<00:02:49.720> well<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.930> not<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.139> very<00:02:51.380> exciting<00:02:51.739> engine

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
and well it's not a very exciting engine

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.660 
and well it's not a very exciting engine
but<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.090> will<00:02:53.420> call<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> pleasant<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:55.310> smooth

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
but I will call it pleasant it's smooth

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.270 
but I will call it pleasant it's smooth
its<00:02:56.060> refined<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.109> very<00:02:57.530> good<00:02:57.829> when<00:02:58.130> you're

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
its refined it's very good when you're

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.640 
its refined it's very good when you're
cruising<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.480> you<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.290> pushing

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
cruising and not really you know pushing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.920 
cruising and not really you know pushing
it<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.639> doesn't<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.120> punch<00:03:02.569> which<00:03:02.810> you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it it doesn't have that punch which you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.110 
it it doesn't have that punch which you
also<00:03:03.350> get<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.799> some<00:03:04.130> competitors<00:03:04.730> engines

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
also get in some competitors engines

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.979 
also get in some competitors engines
like<00:03:05.299> say<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.780> x3<00:03:06.639> but<00:03:07.639> it's<00:03:07.819> nice<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.329> it

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
like say the x3 but it's nice and it

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.780 
like say the x3 but it's nice and it
comes<00:03:09.230> mated<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> very<00:03:09.950> nice<00:03:10.220> 9-speed

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790

I'm<00:03:12.290> sure<00:03:12.500> 9<00:03:12.889> speed<00:03:13.190> sounds<00:03:13.579> like<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> lot<00:03:14.030> but

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
I'm sure 9 speed sounds like a lot but

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.890 
I'm sure 9 speed sounds like a lot but
on<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:15.109> moves<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.470> really<00:03:15.709> can't<00:03:15.920> tell<00:03:16.900> it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
on the moves you really can't tell it

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
really no of the additional ratios only

through the pedals when you find

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.130 
through the pedals when you find

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
a few gears and you really want to move

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.680 
a few gears and you really want to move
forward<00:03:31.720> quickly<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.760> whole<00:03:33.909> it's<00:03:34.330> very

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
forward quickly on the whole it's very

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.729 
forward quickly on the whole it's very
nice<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:37.269> engine<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.780> likeable<00:03:38.260> but<00:03:38.500> there's

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
nice the engine is likeable but there's

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.740 
nice the engine is likeable but there's
more<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.549> about<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.970> discovery<00:03:40.450> sport

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
more to like about the discovery sport

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.850 
more to like about the discovery sport
especially<00:03:41.379> from<00:03:42.040> behind<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.580> wheel<00:03:43.860> in

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
especially from behind the wheel in

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.430 
especially from behind the wheel in
terms<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.310> handling<00:03:45.700> as<00:03:45.819> well<00:03:45.849> it's<00:03:46.440> quite

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
terms of handling as well it's quite

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.369 
terms of handling as well it's quite
nice<00:03:47.680> again<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.180> most<00:03:49.450> exciting<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.110> cars

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
nice again not the most exciting of cars

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.830 
nice again not the most exciting of cars
to<00:03:50.530> drive<00:03:50.650> but<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.819> more<00:03:52.060> than<00:03:52.269> gets<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.660> job

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
to drive but it more than gets the job

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.280 
to drive but it more than gets the job

it's<00:03:53.739> called<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.129> very<00:03:54.310> nice<00:03:54.549> balanced<00:03:55.030> is

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
it's called a very nice balanced is

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's called a very nice balanced is
poised<00:03:55.829> but<00:03:56.829> if<00:03:57.040> there's<00:03:57.310> one<00:03:57.370> thing<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
poised but if there's one thing that I

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.490 
poised but if there's one thing that I
really<00:03:58.239> like<00:03:58.420> about<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.810> car<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
really like about this car it's the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.699 
really like about this car it's the
steering<00:03:59.920> it's<00:04:00.160> direct<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.019> well<00:04:02.019> can<00:04:02.650> be

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
steering it's direct and well can be

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.920 
steering it's direct and well can be
quite<00:04:03.099> sporty<00:04:03.370> at<00:04:03.640> times

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.559 

another<00:04:06.860> aspect<00:04:07.069> of<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.579> sport<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.120> leads<00:04:08.360> a

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
another aspect of the sport that leads a

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.830 
another aspect of the sport that leads a
strong<00:04:08.900> impression<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.829> right<00:04:10.340> quality<00:04:10.909> given

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
strong impression is right quality given

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.210 
strong impression is right quality given
the<00:04:11.930> conditions<00:04:12.439> we<00:04:12.560> were<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.799> drive<00:04:13.010> in

the conditions we were to drive in
Lander<00:04:14.000> wisely<00:04:14.540> chose<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.019> give<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.439> cars

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
Lander wisely chose to give the cars

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.979 
Lander wisely chose to give the cars
with<00:04:16.009> studded<00:04:16.340> tires<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.239> can't<00:04:17.810> really

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
with studded tires so I can't really

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.629 
with studded tires so I can't really
tell<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:18.259> about<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> finer<00:04:18.859> details<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.489> the

tell you about the finer details of the

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.499 
tell you about the finer details of the
right<00:04:20.199> obviously<00:04:21.199> that'll<00:04:21.709> be<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:22.009> bit<00:04:22.310> off<00:04:22.520> but

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
right obviously that'll be a bit off but

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.320 
right obviously that'll be a bit off but
what<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.780> can<00:04:24.139> tell<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.500> it's<00:04:24.650> very<00:04:24.830> nice<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:26.120> a
