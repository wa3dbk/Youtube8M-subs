00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.160 

all<00:00:10.969> right<00:00:11.119> so<00:00:11.270> before<00:00:11.420> we<00:00:11.660> start<00:00:11.990> focusing

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
all right so before we start focusing

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.740 
all right so before we start focusing
we're<00:00:13.129> going<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.430> take<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:13.639> look<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.180> be

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
we're going to take a look and be

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.439 
we're going to take a look and be
hardware<00:00:15.500> will<00:00:15.830> be<00:00:15.859> using<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:16.880> obviously<00:00:17.300> you

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
hardware will be using so obviously you

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.929 
hardware will be using so obviously you
want<00:00:17.600> to<00:00:17.660> set<00:00:17.960> your<00:00:18.140> DSLR<00:00:18.650> to<00:00:18.770> video<00:00:19.160> mode<00:00:19.310> so

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
want to set your DSLR to video mode so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.200 
want to set your DSLR to video mode so
the<00:00:20.119> first<00:00:20.630> main<00:00:21.259> piece<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.949> hardware<00:00:22.880> you

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
the first main piece of hardware you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.999 
the first main piece of hardware you
will<00:00:23.480> be<00:00:23.689> relying<00:00:24.140> on<00:00:24.349> when<00:00:24.710> your<00:00:24.830> mind

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
will be relying on when your mind

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.540 
will be relying on when your mind
focusing<00:00:25.519> will<00:00:25.910> be<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.539> LCD<00:00:27.439> screen<00:00:27.710> now<00:00:28.490> the

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
focusing will be the LCD screen now the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.269 
focusing will be the LCD screen now the
LCD<00:00:29.119> screen<00:00:29.179> will<00:00:29.689> be<00:00:29.869> your<00:00:30.109> main<00:00:30.349> visual<00:00:30.919> -

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
LCD screen will be your main visual -

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.670 
LCD screen will be your main visual -
and<00:00:31.490> your<00:00:31.640> main<00:00:31.849> visual<00:00:32.329> guide<00:00:32.630> for<00:00:33.290> manual

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
and your main visual guide for manual

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.160 
and your main visual guide for manual
focusing<00:00:33.710> so<00:00:34.670> most<00:00:34.970> DSLRs<00:00:35.630> have<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.900> high

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
focusing so most DSLRs have a high

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.440 
focusing so most DSLRs have a high
resolution<00:00:36.740> screen<00:00:37.130> so<00:00:37.850> when<00:00:38.060> I<00:00:38.090> say<00:00:38.300> high

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
resolution screen so when I say high

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.300 
resolution screen so when I say high
resolution<00:00:38.960> when<00:00:39.380> I<00:00:39.410> say<00:00:39.650> high<00:00:39.800> resolution

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
resolution when I say high resolution

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.090 
resolution when I say high resolution
screen<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:40.700> mean<00:00:41.030> around<00:00:41.450> 1<00:00:42.170> million<00:00:42.470> dots<00:00:42.830> on

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
screen I mean around 1 million dots on

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.430 
screen I mean around 1 million dots on
the<00:00:43.370> screen<00:00:43.610> or<00:00:43.850> more<00:00:44.450> now<00:00:44.750> I'm<00:00:45.140> demonstrating

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
the screen or more now I'm demonstrating

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.040 
the screen or more now I'm demonstrating
with<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> EOS<00:00:46.280> 70d<00:00:46.640> here<00:00:47.090> which<00:00:47.330> has<00:00:47.570> one

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
with the EOS 70d here which has one

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.480 
with the EOS 70d here which has one
point<00:00:48.350> zero<00:00:48.680> four<00:00:49.130> million<00:00:49.790> dots<00:00:50.060> so<00:00:51.490> let's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
point zero four million dots so let's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.810 
point zero four million dots so let's
say<00:00:52.700> you're<00:00:52.940> using<00:00:52.970> an<00:00:53.450> 1100<00:00:54.260> D<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:55.310> LCD

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
say you're using an 1100 D and the LCD

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.390 
say you're using an 1100 D and the LCD
screen<00:00:55.880> on<00:00:56.330> that<00:00:56.360> only<00:00:56.660> has<00:00:56.870> around<00:00:57.400> 200,000

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
screen on that only has around 200,000

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.640 
screen on that only has around 200,000
dots<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.120> it<00:00:59.300> might<00:00:59.510> be<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.720> little<00:01:00.170> hard<00:01:00.380> to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
dots so it might be a little hard to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.290 
dots so it might be a little hard to
know<00:01:00.680> sharpness<00:01:01.340> because<00:01:01.520> your<00:01:01.790> LCD<00:01:02.150> screen

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
know sharpness because your LCD screen

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.679 
know sharpness because your LCD screen
can't<00:01:02.900> exactly<00:01:03.380> show<00:01:03.620> enough<00:01:04.309> detail<00:01:04.939> for<00:01:05.180> you

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
can't exactly show enough detail for you

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.959 
can't exactly show enough detail for you
to<00:01:05.780> make<00:01:05.990> up<00:01:06.170> if<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.009> focus<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.179> or<00:01:08.509> out

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
to make up if the focus is in or out

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.020 
to make up if the focus is in or out
so<00:01:11.200> apart<00:01:12.200> from<00:01:12.259> relying<00:01:12.649> on<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.009> LCD<00:01:13.759> screen

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
so apart from relying on the LCD screen

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.810 
so apart from relying on the LCD screen
on<00:01:14.179> your<00:01:14.359> DSLR<00:01:14.899> there<00:01:15.710> are<00:01:15.920> also<00:01:16.159> external

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
on your DSLR there are also external

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.389 
on your DSLR there are also external
monitors<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.899> can<00:01:18.109> purchase

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
monitors that you can purchase

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.249 
monitors that you can purchase
separately<00:01:19.399> so<00:01:19.670> those<00:01:19.880> plug-in<00:01:20.179> to<00:01:20.630> your<00:01:20.780> DSLR

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
separately so those plug-in to your DSLR

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.620 
separately so those plug-in to your DSLR
and<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:21.770> get<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> bigger<00:01:22.310> screen<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:23.270> look<00:01:23.450> at

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and you get a bigger screen to look at

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330 
and you get a bigger screen to look at
so<00:01:23.929> they're<00:01:24.109> bigger<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.499> they're<00:01:24.859> easier<00:01:25.219> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
so they're bigger and they're easier to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.539 
so they're bigger and they're easier to
see<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:26.469> you'll<00:01:27.469> be<00:01:27.619> easier<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.130> judge<00:01:28.369> your

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
see so you'll be easier to judge your

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.179 
see so you'll be easier to judge your
focus<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:28.969> a<00:01:29.030> big<00:01:29.390> screen<00:01:29.630> but<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.409> most<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.069> us

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
focus on a big screen but for most of us

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.779 
focus on a big screen but for most of us
we<00:01:31.399> will<00:01:31.880> be<00:01:32.030> relying<00:01:32.420> on<00:01:32.569> this<00:01:33.340> LCD<00:01:34.340> screen

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
we will be relying on this LCD screen

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.300 
we will be relying on this LCD screen
right<00:01:35.030> here<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.079> certain<00:01:36.469> models<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.889> LCD

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
right here so on certain models the LCD

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.039 
right here so on certain models the LCD
screen<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.880> articulated<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.689> means<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.929> can

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
screen is articulated that means you can

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.809 
screen is articulated that means you can
flip<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> out<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:40.159> tilt<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.609> around

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
flip it out and you can tilt it around

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.480 
flip it out and you can tilt it around
so<00:01:41.389> trust<00:01:41.899> me<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.229> actually<00:01:42.649> helps<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.069> lot

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
so trust me this actually helps a lot

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.609 
so trust me this actually helps a lot
when<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.060> comes<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.420> focusing<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.439> lot

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
when it comes to focusing it's a lot

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.219 
when it comes to focusing it's a lot
easier<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.399> see<00:01:47.090> straight<00:01:47.569> down<00:01:47.600> onto<00:01:48.139> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
easier to see straight down onto the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.219 
easier to see straight down onto the
screen<00:01:48.469> than<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.799> actually<00:01:49.219> peek<00:01:50.209> around<00:01:50.420> onto

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
screen than to actually peek around onto

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.389 
screen than to actually peek around onto
a<00:01:51.560> fixed<00:01:52.219> screen<00:01:52.639> but<00:01:52.909> still<00:01:53.350> many<00:01:54.350> DSLRs<00:01:55.130> such

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
a fixed screen but still many DSLRs such

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.789 
a fixed screen but still many DSLRs such
as<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.729> 5d<00:01:56.060> Mark<00:01:56.090> 3<00:01:56.299> don't<00:01:56.990> have<00:01:57.289> this<00:01:57.499> feature

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
as the 5d Mark 3 don't have this feature

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.039 
as the 5d Mark 3 don't have this feature
so<00:01:58.039> many<00:01:58.819> of<00:01:58.999> us<00:01:59.060> will<00:01:59.420> have<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.719> live<00:01:59.899> with

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
so many of us will have to live with

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.230 
so many of us will have to live with
that<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:00.380> still<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.130> articulator<00:02:01.759> screen<00:02:02.060> is

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
that but still the articulator screen is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.289 
that but still the articulator screen is
more<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.109> luxury<00:02:03.469> so

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
more of a luxury so

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.150 
more of a luxury so
pop<00:02:05.780> on<00:02:05.960> screen<00:02:07.569> it's<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.410> lens<00:02:09.769> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
pop on screen it's on to the lens the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.660 
pop on screen it's on to the lens the
focus<00:02:10.580> ring<00:02:10.729> ring<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.780> lens<00:02:11.959> itself<00:02:12.670> so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
focus ring ring of the lens itself so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.809 
focus ring ring of the lens itself so
the<00:02:14.420> focusing<00:02:14.900> ring<00:02:14.989> will<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.709> great<00:02:16.370> effect

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
the focusing ring will have great effect

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.890 
the focusing ring will have great effect
on<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.980> your<00:02:19.430> focus<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.480> turn<00:02:20.629> out

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
on what your focus is going to turn out

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.490 
on what your focus is going to turn out
so<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.489> location<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.390> design<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> focus

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
so the location and design of the focus

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.570 
so the location and design of the focus
ring<00:02:24.650> varies<00:02:25.129> across<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.299> lenses<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
ring varies across all lenses so you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.539 
ring varies across all lenses so you
generally<00:02:29.150> want<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.569> go<00:02:30.110> for<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.349> nice<00:02:30.830> thick

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
generally want to go for a nice thick

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.630 
generally want to go for a nice thick
rubbery<00:02:32.330> one<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.830> here<00:02:34.069> on<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.280> 20

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
rubbery one like the one here on the 20

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.960 
rubbery one like the one here on the 20
40<00:02:34.940> 105<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.599> lens<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.579> nice<00:02:37.730> feeling

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
40 105 a lens it's a very nice feeling

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.479 
40 105 a lens it's a very nice feeling
one<00:02:38.269> it's<00:02:38.540> fairly<00:02:39.230> smooth<00:02:39.680> because<00:02:40.220> of

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
one it's fairly smooth because of

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.660 
one it's fairly smooth because of
smoothness<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.750> ring<00:02:41.989> will<00:02:42.620> affect<00:02:43.160> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
smoothness of the ring will affect the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.390 
smoothness of the ring will affect the
smoothness<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.599> your<00:02:45.170> focus<00:02:45.560> pull

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
smoothness of your focus pull

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.309 
smoothness of your focus pull
so<00:02:46.610> generally<00:02:47.000> high-quality<00:02:47.750> lenses<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:48.260> a

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
so generally high-quality lenses have a

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.720 
so generally high-quality lenses have a
nice<00:02:48.680> smooth<00:02:49.310> focus<00:02:49.970> ring<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.500> Sigma<00:02:52.069> 18<00:02:52.640> to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
nice smooth focus ring I the Sigma 18 to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.699 
nice smooth focus ring I the Sigma 18 to
35<00:02:53.060> which<00:02:53.239> I'm<00:02:53.420> filming<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.200> here<00:02:54.470> right

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
35 which I'm filming on right here right

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.460 
35 which I'm filming on right here right
now<00:02:54.890> has<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> very<00:02:55.549> smooth<00:02:56.120> focus<00:02:56.569> ring<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.290> as

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
now has a very smooth focus ring so as

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.979 
now has a very smooth focus ring so as
you<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.650> see<00:02:57.709> when<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.579> focus<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:59.120> round<00:02:59.360> it's

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
you can see when I focus it round it's

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.699 
you can see when I focus it round it's
very<00:03:00.349> nice<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.799> smooth<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.470> case

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
very nice and smooth so it's the case

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.150 
very nice and smooth so it's the case
with<00:03:04.040> most<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.970> lenses<00:03:05.500> most<00:03:06.500> quality

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
with most of the lenses most quality

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.410 
with most of the lenses most quality
lenses<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:09.200> example<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.130> 20<00:03:10.700> 40<00:03:10.880> 105<00:03:11.209> has<00:03:11.359> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
lenses for example the 20 40 105 has a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.410 
lenses for example the 20 40 105 has a
nice<00:03:11.690> thick<00:03:11.959> rubbery<00:03:12.560> ring<00:03:12.799> where<00:03:13.459> as<00:03:13.700> this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
nice thick rubbery ring where as this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.610 
nice thick rubbery ring where as this
1022<00:03:15.380> here<00:03:15.709> has<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.160> very<00:03:16.269> slim<00:03:17.269> ring<00:03:17.620> generally

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
1022 here has a very slim ring generally

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.190 
1022 here has a very slim ring generally
thicker<00:03:18.950> rings<00:03:19.310> are<00:03:19.549> nicer<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.180> focus<00:03:20.510> with<00:03:20.660> so

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
thicker rings are nicer to focus with so

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.400 
thicker rings are nicer to focus with so
a<00:03:21.470> slim<00:03:22.010> ring<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.790> not<00:03:23.120> exactly<00:03:23.600> optimum<00:03:24.170> for

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
a slim ring is not exactly optimum for

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.530 
a slim ring is not exactly optimum for
metal<00:03:24.650> focus<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.190> still<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.730> works<00:03:27.250> now<00:03:28.540> aside

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
metal focus but still it works now aside

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.780 
metal focus but still it works now aside
from<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.750> feel<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> focus<00:03:31.069> ring<00:03:31.220> itself

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
from the feel of the focus ring itself

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the focusing ring turning distance is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.759 
the focusing ring turning distance is
also<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.989> huge<00:03:36.680> factor<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.810> manual<00:03:38.810> focusing<00:03:39.260> so

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
also a huge factor on manual focusing so

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.690 
also a huge factor on manual focusing so
the<00:03:40.459> further<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.540> focus<00:03:42.079> ring<00:03:42.260> travels<00:03:42.950> from

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
the further the focus ring travels from

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.030 
the further the focus ring travels from
the<00:03:43.760> closest<00:03:44.720> focusing<00:03:44.900> distance<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:45.680> one

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
the closest focusing distance that's one

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.690 
the closest focusing distance that's one
end<00:03:46.310> all<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.630> way<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.049> other<00:03:48.230> end<00:03:48.700> will

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
end all the way to the other end will

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.080 
end all the way to the other end will
affect<00:03:50.150> how<00:03:50.599> fine-tuned<00:03:51.590> your<00:03:51.950> focus<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.579> so

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
affect how fine-tuned your focus is so

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.050 
affect how fine-tuned your focus is so
generally<00:03:53.540> be<00:03:54.019> further<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.919> travels<00:03:55.060> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
generally be further it travels the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.710 
generally be further it travels the
easier<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:57.169> fine-tune<00:03:58.099> your<00:03:58.310> focus<00:03:59.120> for

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
easier it is to fine-tune your focus for

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.640 
easier it is to fine-tune your focus for
example<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:01.130> canon<00:04:01.669> EF<00:04:01.880> 50mm<00:04:02.329> 1.4<00:04:03.169> lens<00:04:03.380> here

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
example the canon EF 50mm 1.4 lens here

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.280 
example the canon EF 50mm 1.4 lens here
so<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.220> no<00:04:04.459> surprise<00:04:04.519> because<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.690> 1.4

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
so it's no surprise because it is a 1.4

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.680 
so it's no surprise because it is a 1.4
so<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:06.590> get<00:04:06.919> extremely<00:04:07.880> shallow<00:04:08.180> depth<00:04:08.599> of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
so you get extremely shallow depth of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.860 
so you get extremely shallow depth of
field<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:09.139> this<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:10.069> focus<00:04:10.340> has<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.760> be

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
field on this so your focus has to be

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.289 
field on this so your focus has to be
spot-on<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.530> has<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.769> be<00:04:12.859> very<00:04:13.160> very<00:04:14.090> accurate

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
spot-on it has to be very very accurate

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.569 
spot-on it has to be very very accurate
so<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.620> ring<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.040> turns<00:04:16.280> about<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.940> whole

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
so the ring it turns about a whole

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.729 
so the ring it turns about a whole
hundred<00:04:17.819> eighty<00:04:17.970> degrees<00:04:18.419> from<00:04:19.079> one<00:04:19.259> end<00:04:19.470> to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
hundred eighty degrees from one end to

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.569 
hundred eighty degrees from one end to
the<00:04:19.949> other

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the other

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.850 
the other
so<00:04:20.819> that<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.659> closest<00:04:22.079> focusing<00:04:22.229> distance

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
so that is the closest focusing distance

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.179 
so that is the closest focusing distance
to<00:04:23.370> infinity<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.629> it's<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:25.289> long<00:04:25.650> travel

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:26.189 
to infinity so it's a very long travel

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.240 
to infinity so it's a very long travel
it's<00:04:26.539> 180<00:04:27.539> degrees<00:04:28.050> travel<00:04:28.469> so<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.009> means

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
it's 180 degrees travel so that means

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.170 
it's 180 degrees travel so that means
you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.460> fine<00:04:29.789> tune<00:04:29.819> your<00:04:30.300> focus<00:04:30.930> very<00:04:31.530> well

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
you can fine tune your focus very well

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.559 
you can fine tune your focus very well
so<00:04:33.650> one<00:04:34.650> downside<00:04:35.129> of<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.849> if<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
so one downside of this is that if the

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.719 
so one downside of this is that if the
focus<00:04:36.900> traveling<00:04:37.409> distance<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.830> too<00:04:38.039> far<00:04:38.069> it's

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
focus traveling distance is too far it's

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.909 
focus traveling distance is too far it's
very<00:04:38.939> hot<00:04:39.449> for<00:04:39.960> long<00:04:40.169> poles<00:04:40.439> because

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
very hot for long poles because

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.230 
very hot for long poles because
generally<00:04:41.250> you'll<00:04:41.370> be<00:04:41.460> pulling<00:04:41.879> focus<00:04:41.969> with

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
generally you'll be pulling focus with

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.029 
generally you'll be pulling focus with
your<00:04:42.360> fingers<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.960> your<00:04:43.469> fingers<00:04:43.800> can't

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
your fingers and your fingers can't

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.550 
your fingers and your fingers can't
really<00:04:44.310> travel<00:04:44.610> 180<00:04:45.330> degrees<00:04:45.990> around<00:04:46.199> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
really travel 180 degrees around the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.330 
really travel 180 degrees around the
whole<00:04:46.770> lens<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:47.550> it's<00:04:47.789> pretty<00:04:48.120> hard<00:04:48.569> to<00:04:49.310> do<00:04:50.310> a

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
whole lens so it's pretty hard to do a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.490 
whole lens so it's pretty hard to do a
full<00:04:50.819> pull<00:04:51.090> from<00:04:51.719> one<00:04:51.900> side<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.379> other

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
full pull from one side to the other

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.080 
full pull from one side to the other
when<00:04:53.310> you're<00:04:53.490> shooting<00:04:53.639> handheld<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.729> for<00:04:56.729> a

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
when you're shooting handheld so for a

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.999 
when you're shooting handheld so for a
standard<00:04:57.629> zoom<00:04:57.810> lens<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:59.539> 90<00:05:00.539> degree<00:05:01.009> turning

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
standard zoom lens a 90 degree turning

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.399 
standard zoom lens a 90 degree turning
distance<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.520> about<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:03.180> sweet<00:05:03.449> spot<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.020> for

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
distance is about the sweet spot so for

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.050 
distance is about the sweet spot so for
example<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.740> 24<00:05:05.129> to<00:05:05.219> 105<00:05:05.550> here<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:05.879> turns

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
example the 24 to 105 here it turns

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.600 
example the 24 to 105 here it turns
around<00:05:06.379> 90<00:05:07.379> degrees<00:05:07.740> from<00:05:08.039> one<00:05:08.250> end<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
around 90 degrees from one end to the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.420 
around 90 degrees from one end to the
other<00:05:08.759> slightly<00:05:09.719> more<00:05:09.930> but<00:05:10.469> then<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:11.219> works

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
other slightly more but then it works

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.790 
other slightly more but then it works
just<00:05:12.120> fine<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.659> think<00:05:12.719> this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.199> optimum

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
just fine I think this is the optimum

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.240 
just fine I think this is the optimum
focusing<00:05:14.639> distance<00:05:15.029> for<00:05:15.949> turning<00:05:16.949> distance

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
focusing distance for turning distance

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.429 
focusing distance for turning distance
for<00:05:17.430> handheld<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.419> still<00:05:18.659> it's<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.930> personal

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
for handheld but still it's a personal

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.570 
for handheld but still it's a personal
preference<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:20.400> really<00:05:20.879> up<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.090> your<00:05:21.509> own

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
preference it's really up to your own

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.180 
preference it's really up to your own
preferences<00:05:23.639> still<00:05:24.629> I<00:05:24.810> think<00:05:24.960> 90<00:05:25.710> degrees<00:05:25.979> is

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
preferences still I think 90 degrees is

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.209 
preferences still I think 90 degrees is
the<00:05:26.219> easiest<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:27.479> work<00:05:27.659> with<00:05:27.719> now<00:05:28.680> on<00:05:28.830> some

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
the easiest to work with now on some

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.129 
the easiest to work with now on some
cameras<00:05:29.639> there's<00:05:29.879> this<00:05:30.150> feature<00:05:30.419> called

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
cameras there's this feature called

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.740 
cameras there's this feature called
focus<00:05:31.710> peaking<00:05:32.279> now<00:05:32.789> it's<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:32.969> great<00:05:33.150> tool<00:05:33.389> but

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
focus peaking now it's a great tool but

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.890 
focus peaking now it's a great tool but
sadly<00:05:34.259> is<00:05:34.409> not<00:05:34.440> present<00:05:35.159> on<00:05:35.279> all<00:05:35.550> Canon<00:05:36.180> DSLRs

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
sadly is not present on all Canon DSLRs

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.649 
sadly is not present on all Canon DSLRs
as<00:05:37.139> far<00:05:37.469> as<00:05:37.589> I'm<00:05:37.740> concerned<00:05:38.219> so<00:05:38.879> on<00:05:39.150> some<00:05:39.419> other

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
as far as I'm concerned so on some other

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.079 
as far as I'm concerned so on some other
cameras<00:05:40.199> there<00:05:40.409> is<00:05:40.589> this<00:05:40.860> tool<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.729> focus

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
cameras there is this tool the focus

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.119 
cameras there is this tool the focus
peaking<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:43.020> in<00:05:43.349> case<00:05:43.529> you're<00:05:43.680> wondering<00:05:43.830> this

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
peaking so in case you're wondering this

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.769 
peaking so in case you're wondering this
is<00:05:44.190> how<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.639> looks<00:05:44.879> like<00:05:45.060> I've<00:05:45.240> got<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.690> on

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
is how it looks like I've got it on

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.939 
is how it looks like I've got it on
right<00:05:46.080> here<00:05:46.339> so<00:05:47.339> let's<00:05:48.259> see<00:05:49.259> an<00:05:49.349> action<00:05:49.770> so

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
right here so let's see an action so

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.499 
right here so let's see an action so
basically<00:05:50.339> what<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.610> does<00:05:50.759> is<00:05:50.969> it<00:05:51.210> highlights

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
basically what it does is it highlights

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.680 
basically what it does is it highlights
the<00:05:51.990> edges<00:05:52.500> of<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:53.550> subject<00:05:54.089> in<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.360> image

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
the edges of the subject in the image

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.839 
the edges of the subject in the image
that<00:05:54.719> is<00:05:55.229> it<00:05:55.469> sharp<00:05:55.860> focus<00:05:56.370> now<00:05:56.550> for<00:05:56.759> example

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
that is it sharp focus now for example

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.480 
that is it sharp focus now for example
I'm<00:05:57.719> now<00:05:57.900> focusing<00:05:58.409> on<00:05:58.529> the<00:05:58.680> two<00:05:58.860> lenses<00:05:59.310> in

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
I'm now focusing on the two lenses in

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.510 
I'm now focusing on the two lenses in
the<00:05:59.729> background<00:06:00.120> here<00:06:00.810> so<00:06:01.440> as<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:02.219> can<00:06:02.339> see

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
the background here so as you can see

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.159 
the background here so as you can see
the<00:06:02.699> edges<00:06:02.879> of<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.270> lenses<00:06:03.599> are<00:06:03.750> highlighted

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
the edges of the lenses are highlighted

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.709 
the edges of the lenses are highlighted
in<00:06:04.289> red<00:06:04.349> so<00:06:04.740> that<00:06:04.919> indicates<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:05.669> they<00:06:06.479> are

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
in red so that indicates that they are

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.869 
in red so that indicates that they are
in<00:06:07.020> sharp<00:06:07.349> focus<00:06:07.529> now<00:06:07.979> if<00:06:08.099> I<00:06:08.190> focus<00:06:08.400> on<00:06:08.699> the

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
in sharp focus now if I focus on the

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.879 
in sharp focus now if I focus on the
lovely<00:06:09.389> little<00:06:09.509> cat<00:06:09.900> on<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.110> foreground<00:06:10.620> here

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
lovely little cat on the foreground here

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.920 
lovely little cat on the foreground here
you<00:06:11.310> can<00:06:11.430> see<00:06:11.729> that<00:06:11.969> the<00:06:12.120> edges<00:06:12.389> of<00:06:12.659> the<00:06:12.750> cat

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
you can see that the edges of the cat

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.980 
you can see that the edges of the cat
are<00:06:13.349> highlighted<00:06:13.949> in<00:06:14.099> red<00:06:14.389> so<00:06:15.389> that<00:06:15.690> indicates

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
are highlighted in red so that indicates

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.129 
are highlighted in red so that indicates
that<00:06:16.440> that<00:06:17.069> is<00:06:17.310> in<00:06:17.520> sharp<00:06:17.789> focus<00:06:17.819> so<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:18.779> can

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
that that is in sharp focus so you can

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.279 
that that is in sharp focus so you can
see<00:06:19.289> as<00:06:19.500> I<00:06:19.819> move<00:06:20.819> the<00:06:21.150> focus<00:06:21.509> back<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.020> forth

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
see as I move the focus back and forth

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.639 
see as I move the focus back and forth
you<00:06:23.159> can<00:06:23.310> see<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.819> sharp<00:06:24.150> regions<00:06:24.719> getting

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
you can see the sharp regions getting

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.730 
you can see the sharp regions getting
highlighted<00:06:26.219> in<00:06:26.430> red<00:06:27.149> so<00:06:28.050> this<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.620> a

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
highlighted in red so this is a

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.399
