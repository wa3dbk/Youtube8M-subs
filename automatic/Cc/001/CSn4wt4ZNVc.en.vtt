with<00:03:55.230> oil<00:03:55.680> okay<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.730> system<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.180> now<00:03:57.330> set<00:03:57.630> up<00:03:57.840> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
with oil okay the system is now set up I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.380 
with oil okay the system is now set up I
just<00:03:58.770> need<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.070> prime<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.760> then<00:04:00.090> once<00:04:00.270> I

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
just need to prime it and then once I

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.479 
just need to prime it and then once I
get<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.630> primed<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.860> coming<00:04:02.220> out<00:04:02.340> of

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.990 
get it primed and it's coming out of
this<00:04:02.640> reservoir<00:04:03.150> here<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:04.880> stick<00:04:05.880> this

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
this reservoir here I can stick this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.020 
this reservoir here I can stick this
little<00:04:06.180> piece<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.630> here<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:08.220> check<00:04:08.459> valve<00:04:08.489> and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
little piece on here the check valve and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.570 
little piece on here the check valve and
get<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.750> flowing<00:04:10.200> through<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> unit<00:04:12.380> so

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
get it to flowing through the unit so

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.930 
get it to flowing through the unit so
have<00:04:14.580> my<00:04:14.730> control<00:04:15.120> unit<00:04:15.420> here<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.489> ran<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
have my control unit here I just ran the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.430 
have my control unit here I just ran the
wiring<00:04:18.419> down<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.669> backside<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.440> connected

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
wiring down the backside and connected

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.770 
wiring down the backside and connected
it<00:04:22.560> here<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.070> running<00:04:23.419> just<00:04:24.419> down<00:04:24.630> the

here I didn't have to take any of the
faring<00:04:28.770> off

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
faring off

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.010

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.350 
here ran it up behind this plastic piece
and<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:35.190> was<00:04:35.310> pretty<00:04:35.490> simple<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.030> I've<00:04:36.210> only

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
just about have the whole unit put

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.160 
just about have the whole unit put
together<00:04:40.890> which<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.490> kind<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.850> shocking<00:04:42.170> for

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
me I had to go get some zip ties out of

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.780 
me I had to go get some zip ties out of
my<00:04:44.940> shed<00:04:45.380> some<00:04:46.380> white<00:04:46.590> zip<00:04:46.860> ties<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.130> kind<00:04:47.700> of

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
my shed some white zip ties to kind of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.600 
my shed some white zip ties to kind of
put<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.510> together<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.960> way<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.140> wanted<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:50.520> I'm
