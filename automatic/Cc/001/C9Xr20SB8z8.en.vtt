that have the stripes on them now the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.650 
that have the stripes on them now the
purple<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.039> air<00:02:11.250> soluble<00:02:11.910> pen<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
purple one is an air soluble pen and the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.750 
purple one is an air soluble pen and the
blue<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> water<00:02:13.739> soluble<00:02:14.160> pen<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
blue one is a water soluble pen and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.520 
blue one is a water soluble pen and
these<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.360> perfect<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.020> fabric

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
these are perfect for fabric

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.470 
these are perfect for fabric
applications<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.610> let's<00:02:17.819> walk<00:02:18.000> over<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
applications so let's walk over here and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
applications so let's walk over here and
let<00:02:18.690> me<00:02:18.750> show<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.020> exactly<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> mean

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
so if you look right here you can see

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.420 
so if you look right here you can see
that<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.209> two<00:02:24.570> full<00:02:25.080> squares<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> seam

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
that I have two full squares with a seam

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.660 
that I have two full squares with a seam
allowance<00:02:26.970> already<00:02:27.750> drawn<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.470> them<00:02:28.830> super

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
allowance already drawn on them super

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
allowance already drawn on them super
easy<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.269> scanning<00:02:30.600> cut<00:02:30.840> does<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
easy and the scanning cut does all the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
easy and the scanning cut does all the
work<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.400> let<00:02:32.880> me<00:02:32.940> show<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.239> just<00:02:33.510> how

so if I choose this triangle I want to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.920 
so if I choose this triangle I want to
cut<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.670> triangle<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.209> shows<00:03:00.360> me<00:03:00.480> exactly

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
cut that triangle it shows me exactly

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.860 
cut that triangle it shows me exactly
what<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.769> hit<00:03:02.310> okay<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.209> it'll<00:03:03.660> tell<00:03:03.750> me

that's fantastic I'm ready to cut too in

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.900 
that's fantastic I'm ready to cut too in
order<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.260> make<00:03:07.410> my<00:03:07.530> quilt<00:03:07.860> block<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.730> puts

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
order to make my quilt block and it puts

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.630 
order to make my quilt block and it puts
them<00:03:09.030> right<00:03:09.390> there<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.260> mat<00:03:10.440> now<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.310> want

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
them right there on the mat now I want

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.789 
them right there on the mat now I want
to<00:03:11.700> drag<00:03:11.970> them<00:03:12.150> onto<00:03:12.420> my<00:03:12.840> fabric<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.769> I

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
to drag them onto my fabric so that I

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.110 
to drag them onto my fabric so that I
make<00:03:14.010> sure<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.340> actually<00:03:14.459> hits<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.970> so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
make sure that it actually hits it so

I'm<00:03:15.269> gonna<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.570> ahead<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.810> scan<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.829> my<00:03:17.610> fabric

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
I'm gonna go ahead and scan in my fabric

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.970 
I'm gonna go ahead and scan in my fabric
so<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.660> drag<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.320> put<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.739> exactly

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
so that I can drag it and put it exactly

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.190 
so that I can drag it and put it exactly
where<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.880> needs<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.329> nice<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.350> easy<00:03:24.200> now

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
where it needs to be nice and easy now

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.490 
where it needs to be nice and easy now
I'm<00:03:25.530> gonna<00:03:25.709> take<00:03:26.070> my<00:03:26.780> triangles<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.260> can

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
I'm gonna take my triangles and I can

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.190 
I'm gonna take my triangles and I can
place<00:03:28.799> them<00:03:29.130> anywhere<00:03:29.489> on<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.600> fabric<00:03:31.019> that

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
place them anywhere on the fabric that

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.220 
place them anywhere on the fabric that
they<00:03:31.320> fit<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.890> easy<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.420> now<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230

want to do is I want to replace that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.599 
want to do is I want to replace that
color<00:03:37.170> marker<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.950> one<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> water

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
color marker with one of the water

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.030 
color marker with one of the water
soluble<00:03:39.090> ones<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.049> take<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.320> out<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.920> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
soluble ones so I just take it out and I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.310 
soluble ones so I just take it out and I
have<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.609> little<00:03:41.910> cap<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.660> I've<00:03:43.079> saved

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
have that little cap that I've saved

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.650 
have that little cap that I've saved
right<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.190> I'm<00:03:44.940> gonna<00:03:45.090> put<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.359> water

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
right there and I'm gonna put the water

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.810 
right there and I'm gonna put the water
soluble<00:03:46.350> marker<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> same

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
soluble marker in and it's the same

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.050 
soluble marker in and it's the same
process<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.600> simply<00:03:49.049> drop<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.790> close<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.820> up

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
process I simply drop it in close it up
