00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.510 

so<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.589> shutter<00:00:02.010> assembly

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so this is the shutter assembly

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.010 
so this is the shutter assembly
hopefully<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.449> camera<00:00:03.750> will<00:00:03.899> focus<00:00:04.350> here<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
hopefully the camera will focus here and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.750 
hopefully the camera will focus here and
the<00:00:07.020> shutter<00:00:07.259> assembly<00:00:07.620> has<00:00:07.770> two<00:00:08.010> two<00:00:08.340> inputs

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the shutter assembly has two two inputs

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640 
the shutter assembly has two two inputs
to<00:00:09.120> two<00:00:09.330> different<00:00:09.450> coils<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.170> one<00:00:10.530> is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to two different coils one one is

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.220 
to two different coils one one is
driving<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.099> actual<00:00:11.400> shutter<00:00:11.759> coil<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.330> one

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
driving the actual shutter coil and one

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.860 
driving the actual shutter coil and one
is<00:00:13.349> driving<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:15.150> quote-unquote

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
is driving the the quote-unquote

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.390 
is driving the the quote-unquote
aperture<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> an

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
aperture and this is kind of an

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
aperture and this is kind of an
interesting<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:18.029> actually<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:19.230> little

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
interesting thing actually this little

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
interesting thing actually this little
assembly<00:00:20.090> does<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.020> no

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
assembly does not have there is no

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.120 
assembly does not have there is no
aperture<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.640> lens<00:00:23.880> assembly<00:00:24.740> as<00:00:25.740> far<00:00:26.010> as

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
aperture in this lens assembly as far as

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.330 
aperture in this lens assembly as far as
I<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:27.199> there's<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:28.949> shutter

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
I can see there's this little shutter

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.860 
I can see there's this little shutter
open<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.300> closer<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.960> latch<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.439> open<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
open or closer which latch is open and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
open or closer which latch is open and
then<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.680> quote<00:00:35.219> unquote

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
then there is the the quote unquote

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
then there is the the quote unquote
aperture<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> neutral

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
aperture which is actually a neutral

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
aperture which is actually a neutral
density<00:00:37.380> filter<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:39.149> drops<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> optical

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
density filter that drops in the optical

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.360 
density filter that drops in the optical
path<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.579> also<00:00:41.730> latches<00:00:42.660> open<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.530> closed

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
path and it also latches open and closed

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
path and it also latches open and closed
and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.120> did<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.390> experimentation<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and I did some experimentation with this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.540 
and I did some experimentation with this
shutter<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.700> discovered<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.370> if<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
shutter and I discovered that it if you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930 
shutter and I discovered that it if you
apply<00:00:51.770> one<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> half<00:00:53.070> volts<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.789> these

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
apply one and a half volts to these

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.760 
apply one and a half volts to these
contacts<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> back<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
contacts on the back if I can get to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.410 
contacts on the back if I can get to
them<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.010> cause<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> open<00:01:00.300> or

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
them here you can cause it to open or

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.100 
them here you can cause it to open or
close<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> opening<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.800> closing<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
close and the opening and closing is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
close and the opening and closing is
polarity<00:01:04.110> dependence<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.610> applying

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
polarity dependence so one applying

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
polarity dependence so one applying
positive<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> negative<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
positive to one side and negative to the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
positive to one side and negative to the
other<00:01:08.610> side<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.600> cause<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> open<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
other side will cause it to open and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
other side will cause it to open and
then<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> additionally<00:01:12.030> flip<00:01:12.689> them

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
then you have to additionally flip them

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.560 
then you have to additionally flip them
around<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> close

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
around to get it to close

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.590 
around to get it to close
surprise<00:01:15.570> surprise<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:17.270> I'll<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
surprise surprise really I'll see if I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.530 
surprise surprise really I'll see if I
can<00:01:18.780> demonstrate<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:25.729> there<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> closed<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
can demonstrate that there it closed and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.770 
can demonstrate that there it closed and
now<00:01:27.840> I'll<00:01:27.990> flip<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.409> around<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
now I'll flip these around and if I can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
now I'll flip these around and if I can
make<00:01:33.930> contact<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> opens<00:01:34.890> again<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
make contact there it opens again so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
make contact there it opens again so
that's<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> operation<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> shutter

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that's the operation of the shutter

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.780 
that's the operation of the shutter
mechanism<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:41.189> other<00:01:41.310> interesting

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
mechanism the the other interesting

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.530 
mechanism the the other interesting
thing<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> CCD<00:01:43.320> sensor

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
thing is because this is a CCD sensor

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.149 
thing is because this is a CCD sensor
you<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.930> need<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> shutter<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.890> front

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you you need to have a shutter in front

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
you you need to have a shutter in front
of<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> too<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> sensor<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
of it too for the sensor to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.899 
of it too for the sensor to
appropriately<00:01:49.380> operate<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> whole<00:01:50.640> goal

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
appropriately operate so the whole goal

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
appropriately operate so the whole goal
of<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.180> disassembly<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> broken

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of this disassembly of this broken

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
of this disassembly of this broken
camera<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> determine<00:01:53.610> whether<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.450> not

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
camera was to determine whether or not

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
camera was to determine whether or not
the<00:01:54.780> sensor<00:01:55.110> could<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.380> mated<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.770> some<00:01:56.040> kind

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the sensor could be mated with some kind

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.370 
the sensor could be mated with some kind
of<00:01:56.369> external<00:01:56.729> lens<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> could

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of external lens and I think you could

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.810 
of external lens and I think you could
actually<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.219> could<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.430> pulled<00:02:02.670> off

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
actually I think it could be pulled off

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.249 
actually I think it could be pulled off
if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> sort<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.540> removed<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> whole

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
if you sort of just removed the whole

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.350 
if you sort of just removed the whole
lens<00:02:04.469> assembly<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.130> use<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.969> sensor

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
lens assembly and use the sensor

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
lens assembly and use the sensor
externally<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.220> you'd<00:02:08.340> still<00:02:08.459> need<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
externally but you'd still need a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.309 
externally but you'd still need a
shutter<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> place<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
shutter in place and right now the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
shutter in place and right now the
limiting<00:02:10.860> factor<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> actually<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
limiting factor is actually the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.520 
limiting factor is actually the
thickness<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.510> shutter

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
thickness of this shutter

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
thickness of this shutter
so<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.770> order<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.820> an<00:02:15.000> additional<00:02:15.480> lens

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so in order to have an additional lens

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.230 
so in order to have an additional lens
out<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.130> distance<00:02:17.580> between<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
out here the the distance between the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.330 
out here the the distance between the
lens<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.990> sensor<00:02:19.410> has<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.220> be

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
lens and the sensor has to be

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.860 
lens and the sensor has to be
essentially<00:02:20.790> greater<00:02:21.060> than<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.480> sandwich

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
essentially greater than this sandwich

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
essentially greater than this sandwich
of<00:02:22.080> assemblies<00:02:22.610> which<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> few
