seems<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.100> be<00:00:06.350> a<00:00:07.350> little<00:00:07.529> bit<00:00:07.680> more<00:00:07.950> simple

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
than the one for the x100 think this is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.259 
than the one for the x100 think this is
the<00:00:24.890> party<00:00:25.890> from<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> manual<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.150> you

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
the ER on the x100 I didn't notice this

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.809 
the ER on the x100 I didn't notice this
at<00:02:27.030> first<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.700> lot<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:31.819> you

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
at first but it's a it's a lot more you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.410 
at first but it's a it's a lot more you
know<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> feels<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.600> nicer<00:02:34.260> actually

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
know it feels a little nicer actually

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.509 
know it feels a little nicer actually
let's<00:02:36.420> try<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.900> pop<00:02:37.110> power<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.830> let's

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
let's try and pop power this on let's

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.420 
let's try and pop power this on let's
hope<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.000> understand<00:02:39.480> what's<00:02:39.660> oh<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:41.160> it's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
hope we can understand what's oh so it's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.990 
hope we can understand what's oh so it's
all<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:42.470> Japanese<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:47.000> probably

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
all in Japanese so that was probably

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.290 
all in Japanese so that was probably
expected<00:02:48.600> let<00:02:49.019> me<00:02:49.670> get<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.150> in

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
expected let me get back to you in

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.500 
expected let me get back to you in
another<00:02:51.390> video<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.489> I'll<00:02:53.489> figure<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.150> which

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
another video and I'll figure out which

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
another video and I'll figure out which
one<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.950> English<00:02:56.540> all<00:02:57.540> right
