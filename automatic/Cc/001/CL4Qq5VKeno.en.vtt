00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
concerned about this week no no um I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.130 
concerned about this week no no um I
think<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.430> mean<00:02:40.820> if<00:02:41.420> they're<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.080> to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
think that I mean if they're going to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.750 
think that I mean if they're going to
stick<00:02:42.320> with<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.620> system<00:02:43.130> they<00:02:43.280> probably<00:02:43.580> need

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
stick with the system they probably need

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.150 
stick with the system they probably need
to<00:02:43.850> tweak<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.390> little<00:02:44.510> bit<00:02:44.720> sure<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.860> part

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
to tweak it a little bit sure and part

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.130 
to tweak it a little bit sure and part
