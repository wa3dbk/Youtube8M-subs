00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.350
 empatamos because well because we 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.050
 failed 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.240
 we have failed in both goals but 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.129
 there is also a previous incident to 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 second goal that is very weak very 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.760
 evident very clearly and no longer passes through 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.310
 second consecutive time with two friends 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.070
 Mexicans that do not harm 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.900
 the truth that one I believe that this 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.849
 party has been planned for a long time 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.520
 this time does not hit weeks has been 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.619
 a lot of time to get it out and 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.900
 those are very specific plays very 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.520
 where he makes a mistake to 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.970
 roman very clear I think you've seen which 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.980
 everyone has seen and let follow 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.519
 from there the continuity of that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.290
 same play 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.350
 the consequence ends in a goal against 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 then I consider that they have not removed 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.020
 something that they have not removed something today 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.210
 I really believe that you are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.470
 or they can be witnesses that I have the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 selection I 've never talked about the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.190
 referees but they have already coincided two 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.400
 Mexicans who have not harmed 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.960
 totally in a final result and now 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.360
 has not harmed the work that we have 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.220
 planned for a long time and about 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.740
 all in a very important situation 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.630
 as it is a hexagonal and where these 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.910
 points that you have lost or that have 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 removed then you can pay dearly 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.510
 at the end of the same school I do not think 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.520
 that the fans have gone out to enjoy 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.720
 with the team came out as with the skjern 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.950
 with the team I do not think there's any way out 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 wheels the team gave everything to 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.020
 earn it be my opinion I do not think the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.920
 hobby has left disappointed of amount 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.540
 more wins but did not win 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.540
 good 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.710
 you tried everything in order to win your 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.120
 notes saying that we have given everything to 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 win but I feel 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.380
 the boys too 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.380
 logically I think that 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.470
 I want to manifest my mood 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.090
 they feel them too because they think that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.820
 something has escaped 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 that we had practically almost 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.509
 got but really I they know 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.240
 that this is just beginning us a 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.550
 part we have that out of career 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 all just started and they know that 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.810
 ahead we have 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.430
 many possibilities of being able to advance 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.609
 progress little by little we 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.250
 we know we have capacity we have 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.439
 team to get ahead but 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 logically it is a hard blow hard blow 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.849
 for everything that has happened in the game 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.379
 you put on when it's of advantage in the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.450
 marker and then I have now a 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.790
 game to play at home a space of 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.500
 assimilate it anyway 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.860
 players know that this is just beginning 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.680
 there 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.330
 and they will continue working to get 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.060
 this forward without a doubt 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.980
 good match it seems to me that panama had 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.420
 in football at times we suddenly 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.160
 we are careless with the ball the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.410
 we give away very easily in the eagerness 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.000
 attack and they found good handling 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.830
 of ball for a while although easy 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.690
 match possibly in the second 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.970
 time we react we press better 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 we found more the ball we had calm 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.270
 I believe that despair we want 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.830
 win the game in the first minutes 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.410
 it leads us to easily lose the ball 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.900
 and panama more calmly with better 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.460
 control of ball against actions 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.110
 surprising logical options but of 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.640
 back and the first goal is a good goal 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 the second suddenly some describe 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.500
 of us we did not find the tie myself 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.360
 I think the match is very good 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.920
 we press in the opposite field we play with 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.290
 risk could have found us a 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.230
 risky backlash but happily not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.820
 it was seen in the patch injury I think that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 is a game played from beginning to 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 end the two teams I have to say it 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.550
 frankly we look to play well at 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.020
 football we must recognize that panama 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.530
 He sought to play football well and of course 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.530
 we
