motherboards<00:01:03.109> won't<00:01:03.350> be<00:01:03.469> able<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.710> use<00:01:03.890> this

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
motherboards won't be able to use this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.010 
motherboards won't be able to use this
but<00:01:04.580> like<00:01:04.699> I<00:01:04.850> said<00:01:04.910> with<00:01:05.210> eight<00:01:05.420> changes<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.990> a

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
but like I said with eight changes to a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.120 
but like I said with eight changes to a
motherboard<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.590> believe<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.950> other

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
motherboard and I believe that other

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.770 
motherboard and I believe that other
sizes<00:01:07.460> will<00:01:07.550> be<00:01:07.580> working<00:01:07.910> with<00:01:07.940> everybody<00:01:08.420> so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
sizes will be working with everybody so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.330 
sizes will be working with everybody so
you'll<00:01:09.260> be<00:01:09.410> able<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.590> get<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:09.800> technology

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
that one that one over there has a lot

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.969 
that one that one over there has a lot
more<00:01:35.840> stuff<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.560> side<00:01:36.740> right<00:01:36.920> here

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
more stuff on the side right here

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.560 
more stuff on the side right here
compared<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:37.640> one<00:01:37.850> which<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.240> actually<00:01:38.509> a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
compared to this one which is actually a

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.929 
compared to this one which is actually a
why<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.079> running<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.350> lot<00:01:39.469> faster<00:01:39.890> here<00:01:40.850> we

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
why it's running a lot faster here we

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.380 
why it's running a lot faster here we
see<00:01:41.119> some<00:01:41.270> more<00:01:41.299> of<00:01:41.479> their<00:01:41.600> xpg<00:01:42.110> memory<00:01:43.390> you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
see some more of their xpg memory you
