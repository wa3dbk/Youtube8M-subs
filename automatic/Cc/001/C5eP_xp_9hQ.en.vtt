situation is I actually think that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.550 
situation is I actually think that

using scourge nowadays because Zerg
players<00:02:06.540> are<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.049> good<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.380> their<00:02:07.710> circling

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.110 
when they get just about five or six
minutes<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.640> pick<00:02:14.820> off<00:02:14.940> an

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
minutes can you just pick off an

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.610 
minutes can you just pick off an
infinite<00:02:15.510> number<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.590> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
infinite number of them and it's just

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.110 
infinite number of them and it's just
really<00:02:16.860> hard<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> use<00:02:17.400> scourge<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> lot<00:02:18.090> of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
really hard to use scourge so a lot of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660 
really hard to use scourge so a lot of
times<00:02:18.330> couraged<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.870> wasted<00:02:19.560> nowadays<00:02:19.890> looks

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
times couraged are wasted nowadays looks

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
times couraged are wasted nowadays looks
like<00:02:20.790> both<00:02:20.970> ways<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:21.710> going<00:02:22.710> 4-12

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
like both ways actually going 4-12

this map is Andromeda I didn't mention

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.700 
this map is Andromeda I didn't mention
that<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:30.270> fairly<00:02:30.450> large<00:02:30.840> four<00:02:31.500> player

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
that so it's a fairly large four player

that so it's a fairly large four player

map so perhaps going for the rush we
just<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.710> less<00:02:35.010> likely<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.430> succeed<00:02:35.610> and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
just it's less likely to succeed and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.080 
just it's less likely to succeed and
looks<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:37.590> luxury<00:02:38.370> has<00:02:38.610> set<00:02:38.850> up<00:02:38.940> his

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
looks like your luxury has set up his

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.449 
looks like your luxury has set up his
spawning<00:02:39.690> pool<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.110> gas<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.070> has<00:02:41.250> over

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
spawning pool and gas and so has over

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.980 
spawning pool and gas and so has over
scarred<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:41.850> sky<00:02:42.180> seems<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.600> second

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
scarred over sky seems to be a second

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.010 
scarred over sky seems to be a second
slower<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> five<00:02:44.310> o'clock<00:02:44.490> position

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
slower here at the five o'clock position

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.820 
slower here at the five o'clock position
but<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.110> far<00:02:46.260> both<00:02:46.410> going<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> 12<00:02:47.400> pool<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
but so far both going for a 12 pool and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.670 
but so far both going for a 12 pool and
extractor<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.780> both<00:02:51.780> players<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.200> seems<00:02:52.380> will

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
extractor so both players it seems will

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.680 
extractor so both players it seems will
be<00:02:52.800> getting<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> wall<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.209> sure<00:02:54.270> could<00:02:54.660> be

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
be getting a wall I'm not sure could be

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.820 
be getting a wall I'm not sure could be
that<00:02:54.900> both<00:02:55.050> players<00:02:55.200> are<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.650> for

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
that both players are going to go for

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.960 
that both players are going to go for
the<00:02:55.860> second<00:02:56.160> hat-trick<00:02:56.310> first<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.820> looks

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the second hat-trick first and looks

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.210 
the second hat-trick first and looks

sunken<00:03:25.769> colonies<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.190> possible<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.450> it's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
sunken colonies is possible but it's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.560 
sunken colonies is possible but it's
really<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.620> cost<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.310> really<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.970> very<00:03:30.299> hard

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
really a cost that really is very hard

to endure in zurich vs zerg and it's

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.880 
to endure in zurich vs zerg and it's
really<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.970> want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.900> leave<00:03:34.140> away<00:03:34.500> as

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
really one you want to to leave away as

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.320 
really one you want to to leave away as

much as possible it's like over sky got
is<00:03:36.450> layer<00:03:36.690> upgrading<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.260> second<00:03:37.620> before

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
is layer upgrading a second before

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.759 
is layer upgrading a second before
before<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.450> luxury<00:03:40.200> did<00:03:40.380> but<00:03:40.530> i<00:03:40.560> don't<00:03:40.739> think

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
before you luxury did but i don't think

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.690 
before you luxury did but i don't think
that's<00:03:40.980> gonna<00:03:41.070> make<00:03:41.220> too<00:03:41.340> much<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.519> difference

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
that's gonna make too much of difference

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.039 
that's gonna make too much of difference
will<00:03:41.940> be<00:03:41.970> interesting<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:42.450> how<00:03:42.660> many

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
will be interesting to see how many

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.479 
will be interesting to see how many
zerglings<00:03:43.530> each<00:03:43.680> player<00:03:43.920> decides<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.310> produce

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
zerglings each player decides to produce

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.960 
zerglings each player decides to produce
with<00:03:45.330> their<00:03:45.480> initial<00:03:45.780> larvae<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.970> yeah

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
with their initial larvae and yeah

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.160 
with their initial larvae and yeah
whether<00:03:48.239> they<00:03:48.360> decided<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:48.959> attack<00:03:49.140> or

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
whether they decided go for an attack or

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.539 
whether they decided go for an attack or
not<00:03:49.380> i<00:03:49.410> assume<00:03:49.620> both<00:03:49.799> are<00:03:49.980> gonna<00:03:50.130> go<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.340> speed

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
not i assume both are gonna go for speed

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.070 
not i assume both are gonna go for speed
upgrade<00:03:50.880> also<00:03:51.269> because<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:51.959> is

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
upgrade also because that really is

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.600 
upgrade also because that really is
necessary<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.709> looks<00:03:52.830> like<00:03:52.920> luxury<00:03:53.100> has<00:03:53.370> six

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
necessary it looks like luxury has six

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
necessary it looks like luxury has six
links<00:03:53.880> out<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.239> produce<00:03:54.420> three<00:03:55.049> eggs<00:03:55.260> full

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
links out so you produce three eggs full

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.170 
links out so you produce three eggs full
and<00:03:55.739> i'm<00:03:56.130> not<00:03:56.220> sure<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.459> he's<00:03:56.489> still<00:03:56.760> producing

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and i'm not sure if he's still producing

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.710 
and i'm not sure if he's still producing
them<00:03:57.299> over<00:03:58.230> scott<00:03:58.410> here<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.709> four<00:03:58.950> zerglings

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
them over scott here with four zerglings

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.590 
them over scott here with four zerglings
but<00:04:00.720> i<00:04:00.930> presume<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.650> by<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.920> time<00:04:02.600> luxury

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
but i presume that by a time luxury

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.030 
but i presume that by a time luxury

have a couple more circlings and then
it'll<00:04:06.480> be<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.810> sort<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.320> circling<00:04:07.739> dance<00:04:08.040> as

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
it'll be the sort of circling dance as

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.220 
it'll be the sort of circling dance as

see if luxury of course luxury will get
inspired<00:04:40.699> he's<00:04:40.909> gonna<00:04:41.029> get<00:04:41.180> about<00:04:41.330> five

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
inspired he's gonna get about five

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.330 
inspired he's gonna get about five
seconds<00:04:42.020> later<00:04:42.139> so<00:04:42.379> not<00:04:42.560> enough<00:04:42.800> time<00:04:43.039> for

spotting<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.849> expansion<00:04:50.779> hatchery<00:04:51.139> from

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
spotting the expansion hatchery from

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.869 
spotting the expansion hatchery from
luxury<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.710> think<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:52.009> took<00:04:52.099> that<00:04:52.310> long<00:04:52.370> for<00:04:52.580> his

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
luxury I think it took that long for his

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.320 
luxury I think it took that long for his
/<00:04:53.710> overlord<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.770> get<00:04:54.919> 02<00:04:55.520> luxuries<00:04:55.939> base<00:04:56.090> and

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
/ overlord to get 02 luxuries base and

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.399 
/ overlord to get 02 luxuries base and
now<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.539> seems<00:04:56.599> like<00:04:56.810> he's<00:04:56.930> going<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.139> go<00:04:57.259> for

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
now it seems like he's going to go for

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.290 
now it seems like he's going to go for
an<00:04:57.499> attack<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.009> looks<00:04:58.789> like<00:04:58.819> he<00:04:58.909> has<00:04:59.120> speed

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
an attack here looks like he has speed

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.179 
an attack here looks like he has speed
upgrade<00:04:59.689> but<00:04:59.870> there's<00:05:00.349> more<00:05:00.560> zerglings<00:05:01.009> there

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
upgrade but there's more zerglings there

upgrade but there's more zerglings there
for<00:05:01.400> luxury<00:05:01.669> so<00:05:01.789> I<00:05:01.849> don't<00:05:02.029> think<00:05:02.150> that's<00:05:02.300> this

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
for luxury so I don't think that's this

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.450 
for luxury so I don't think that's this

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
will work out at all for him he chooses

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.830 
will work out at all for him he chooses
to<00:05:04.490> commit<00:05:04.789> looks<00:05:05.180> like<00:05:05.300> he's<00:05:05.449> not<00:05:05.569> choosing

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
to commit looks like he's not choosing

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.969 
to commit looks like he's not choosing
coming<00:05:06.169> actually<00:05:06.409> he's<00:05:06.500> going<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.680> run<00:05:06.770> back<00:05:06.949> a

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
coming actually he's going to run back a

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.070 
coming actually he's going to run back a
little<00:05:07.189> bit<00:05:07.340> here<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.810> he<00:05:08.810> could<00:05:08.990> be

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
little bit here and he could be

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.019 
little bit here and he could be
producing<00:05:09.439> more<00:05:09.590> zerglings<00:05:10.159> here<00:05:10.340> just<00:05:10.849> to<00:05:10.939> be

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
producing more zerglings here just to be

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.360 
producing more zerglings here just to be
able<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.330> get<00:05:12.289> some<00:05:12.469> sort<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.680> attack<00:05:12.979> out<00:05:13.189> and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
able to get some sort of attack out and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.740 
able to get some sort of attack out and
preventing<00:05:13.909> a<00:05:14.000> luxury<00:05:14.330> from<00:05:14.479> getting<00:05:14.659> an

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
preventing a luxury from getting an

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.869 
preventing a luxury from getting an
economic<00:05:15.169> lead<00:05:15.379> here<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.740> actually<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.729> looks

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
economic lead here and actually it looks

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.429 
economic lead here and actually it looks
like<00:05:17.000> he<00:05:17.270> did<00:05:17.419> have<00:05:17.599> two<00:05:17.839> overlords<00:05:18.319> over

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439 
like he did have two overlords over

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.779 
like he did have two overlords over
there<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.740> wasn't<00:05:19.039> just<00:05:19.159> that<00:05:19.279> moment<00:05:19.520> he

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
there so it wasn't just that moment he

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.790 
there so it wasn't just that moment he
spotted<00:05:20.029> hatchery<00:05:20.419> actually<00:05:21.139> he<00:05:21.289> had<00:05:21.439> an

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
spotted hatchery actually he had an

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.200 
spotted hatchery actually he had an
overlord<00:05:22.159> there<00:05:22.370> for<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.819> while<00:05:22.969> but

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
overlord there for a while but

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.600 
overlord there for a while but
regardless<00:05:23.569> um<00:05:24.039> luxury<00:05:25.039> is<00:05:25.069> not<00:05:25.370> gonna<00:05:25.520> be

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
regardless um luxury is not gonna be

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.100 
regardless um luxury is not gonna be
able<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.819> get<00:05:25.999> much<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.270> economically<00:05:26.839> though

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
able to get much of economically though

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.629 
able to get much of economically though
until<00:05:27.259> he<00:05:27.439> puts<00:05:27.650> down<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.919> second<00:05:28.490> gas

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
until he puts down a second gas

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.740 
until he puts down a second gas
extractor<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.210> that's<00:05:29.360> going<00:05:29.509> to<00:05:29.569> cost

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
extractor and that's going to cost

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.450 
extractor and that's going to cost
emissive<00:05:30.169> a<00:05:30.319> significant<00:05:31.219> amount<00:05:31.310> of

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
emissive a significant amount of

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.399 
emissive a significant amount of
minerals<00:05:31.789> of<00:05:32.270> which<00:05:32.479> ant<00:05:32.750> larvae<00:05:33.139> which<00:05:33.289> he

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
minerals of which ant larvae which he

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.959 
minerals of which ant larvae which he
can't<00:05:33.620> be<00:05:33.740> producing<00:05:34.219> servants<00:05:34.639> with<00:05:34.759> so<00:05:34.879> it

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
can't be producing servants with so it

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.429 
can't be producing servants with so it
looks<00:05:35.120> like<00:05:35.240> he's<00:05:35.360> delaying<00:05:35.719> doing<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.229> and

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
looks like he's delaying doing that and

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.800 
looks like he's delaying doing that and
he's<00:05:36.469> probably<00:05:37.189> gonna<00:05:37.370> wait<00:05:37.550> until<00:05:37.669> his<00:05:38.120> mule

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
he's probably gonna wait until his mule

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.510 
he's probably gonna wait until his mule
escs<00:05:39.110> are<00:05:39.229> out<00:05:39.409> and<00:05:39.620> perhaps<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:40.069> he<00:05:40.099> gained

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
escs are out and perhaps that he gained

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.700 
escs are out and perhaps that he gained
some<00:05:40.759> sort<00:05:40.939> initial<00:05:41.389> initial<00:05:42.020> advantage

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
some sort initial initial advantage

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.860 
some sort initial initial advantage
before<00:05:43.129> he<00:05:43.339> decides<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:44.029> build<00:05:44.180> upon<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.509> get

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
before he decides to build upon and get

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.420 
before he decides to build upon and get
any<00:05:45.020> drones<00:05:45.439> at<00:05:45.529> his<00:05:45.620> expansion<00:05:45.949> notice<00:05:46.339> that

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
any drones at his expansion notice that

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.459 
any drones at his expansion notice that
his<00:05:46.490> expansions<00:05:47.029> actually<00:05:47.360> completely<00:05:48.050> empty

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
his expansions actually completely empty

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.559 
his expansions actually completely empty
of<00:05:48.500> any<00:05:48.649> drones<00:05:49.009> right<00:05:49.159> now<00:05:49.279> I<00:05:49.490> can't<00:05:50.300> tell<00:05:50.419> who

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
of any drones right now I can't tell who

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.749 
of any drones right now I can't tell who
has<00:05:50.689> more<00:05:51.050> zerglings<00:05:51.500> right<00:05:51.649> now<00:05:51.800> really<00:05:52.639> it

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
has more zerglings right now really it

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.550 
has more zerglings right now really it
seems<00:05:52.969> based<00:05:53.689> on<00:05:53.779> the<00:05:53.899> billet<00:05:54.199> it<00:05:54.289> should<00:05:54.469> be

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
seems based on the billet it should be

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.839 
seems based on the billet it should be
very<00:05:54.860> close<00:05:55.039> right<00:05:55.279> now<00:05:55.370> I<00:05:55.430> don't<00:05:55.520> think<00:05:55.669> there

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
very close right now I don't think there

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.040 
very close right now I don't think there
should<00:05:56.029> be<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.240> much<00:05:56.330> of<00:05:56.389> a<00:05:56.539> divergence

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
should be that much of a divergence

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.110 
should be that much of a divergence
looks<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.680> over<00:05:57.979> sky<00:05:58.219> has<00:05:58.430> a<00:05:58.460> spiral<00:05:58.789> let's

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
looks like over sky has a spiral let's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.309 
looks like over sky has a spiral let's
see<00:05:59.180> what<00:05:59.330> decides<00:05:59.599> to<00:05:59.689> produce<00:05:59.839> with<00:06:00.139> this

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
see what decides to produce with this

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.589 
see what decides to produce with this
initial<00:06:00.860> larva<00:06:01.159> here<00:06:01.399> of<00:06:01.939> course<00:06:02.149> the<00:06:02.270> balance

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
initial larva here of course the balance

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.149 
initial larva here of course the balance
between<00:06:02.750> scourge<00:06:03.139> and<00:06:03.259> mutalisks<00:06:03.500> is<00:06:03.770> quite

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
between scourge and mutalisks is quite

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.219
