00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.840
 electrical 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.820
 let's look at a new electric bike 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.610
 from the life of butterflies 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.710
 battery in Ferrara starts in Canosa danieli 65 kilometers bat of the evening. 7TV 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.280

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.330
 company take place here and also to marry the cause green planet headquarters and then 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 also of the ecology of eco-sustainable mobility 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.140
 it would be easy to answer that the motivations of a company are 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.740
 motivations to say straits 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.360
 perceh I love a company that guides and minds about business 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.020
 clearly you can do business with entrepreneurial details anyway 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.510
 different we liked the idea of ​​making god himself by bringing a product to the market 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.220
 that would solve a real problem that is already sustainable mobility 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.390
 above all this is the main motivation 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.610
 flash based on this I have amos developed from a year and a half to this 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.300
 part we have developed a research and consequently of the products that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.690
 could give an answer to the question now forever - latent 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.980
 increasingly concrete to have products that are precisely now

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.589
 here but in particular a product was born that you see here behind my back 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:41.129

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.100
 competition for which we liked the idea of ​​giving a vehicle that does not pollute if 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.580
 but that perhaps also beautiful 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.940
