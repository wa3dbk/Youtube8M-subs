oval<00:02:26.950> shaped<00:02:27.220> or<00:02:27.430> maybe<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.849> bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
oval shaped or maybe a little bit

oval shaped or maybe a little bit
smaller<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:29.200> start<00:02:29.380> from<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> top<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.920> your

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
like this that's going to create a nice

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.270 
like this that's going to create a nice
shadow<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.470> looks<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.740> little<00:02:37.860> bit<00:02:38.040> smaller

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
shadow so it looks a little bit smaller

shadow so it looks a little bit smaller
and<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.670> little<00:02:38.850> bit<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.060> defined<00:02:39.390> now<00:02:40.320> it's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and a little bit more defined now it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.720 
and a little bit more defined now it's
time<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.830> cheeks<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.310> cheeks<00:02:41.580> are

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
time for the cheeks the cheeks are

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.340 
time for the cheeks the cheeks are
probably<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> easiest<00:02:42.420> part<00:02:42.810> you're<00:02:43.230> just

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
probably the easiest part you're just

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.510 
probably the easiest part you're just
going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> go<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.160> edge<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.400> your

going to go right to the edge of your
ear<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:45.120> where<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.410> your

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
ear right where you can see your

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.650 
ear right where you can see your
cheekbone<00:02:47.010> you're<00:02:47.910> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> start<00:02:48.540> at<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
cheekbone you're going to start at the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
cheekbone you're going to start at the
top<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.740> start<00:02:50.010> bringing<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.520> line

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
top and just start bringing a line

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.390 
top and just start bringing a line
downward<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.770> okay<00:02:53.040> if<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.250> looks

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
downward and it's okay if it looks

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
downward and it's okay if it looks
really<00:02:53.610> harsh<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.330> severe<00:02:54.750> because

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
really harsh and really severe because

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.570 
really harsh and really severe because
we're<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> blend<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> out<00:02:56.070> later<00:02:56.280> just

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
we're going to blend it out later just

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.310 
we're going to blend it out later just
remember<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.600> thing<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:57.990> want<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
remember that one thing that you want to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.110 
remember that one thing that you want to
do<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.560> make<00:02:58.800> sure<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.520> right<00:02:59.730> underneath

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
do is make sure you get right underneath

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.610 
do is make sure you get right underneath
that<00:03:00.330> cheekbone<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.440> it's

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
that cheekbone because that way it's
