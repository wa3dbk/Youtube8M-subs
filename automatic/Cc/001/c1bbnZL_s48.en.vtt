00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.560 

your<00:01:29.590> deck<00:01:29.830> type<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> small<00:01:30.760> formula<00:01:31.330> or

your deck type is a small formula or

your deck type is a small formula or

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
kind of a personal ID that tells you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.510 
kind of a personal ID that tells you
what<00:01:34.720> are<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.080> things<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.560> like<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.040> most<00:01:36.280> in

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
what are the things you like the most in

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.270 
what are the things you like the most in
a<00:01:36.910> deck<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.450> way<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.630> do<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.290> this<00:01:38.650> formula<00:01:39.190> is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
a deck the way I do it this formula is

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.550 
a deck the way I do it this formula is
made<00:01:39.460> up<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.760> four<00:01:40.060> factors<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.870> complexity

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
made up of four factors your complexity

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.370 
made up of four factors your complexity
play-style<00:01:42.340> wind<00:01:43.030> condition<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.720> secondary

play-style wind condition and secondary

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.830 
play-style wind condition and secondary
strategy<00:01:44.980> decks<00:01:45.580> also<00:01:46.120> have<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> similar

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
strategy decks also have a similar

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.800 
strategy decks also have a similar
formula<00:01:47.200> builds<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.190> players<00:01:48.550> vary<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.630> it's

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
formula builds and players vary so it's

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.470 
formula builds and players vary so it's
not<00:01:50.080> an<00:01:50.290> exact<00:01:50.740> science<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.640> chances<00:01:52.150> are<00:01:52.360> if

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
not an exact science but chances are if

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.720 
not an exact science but chances are if
you<00:01:52.630> find<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:53.140> deck<00:01:53.440> whose<00:01:53.680> formula<00:01:54.040> matches

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
you find a deck whose formula matches

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.060 
you find a deck whose formula matches
your<00:01:55.030> ideal<00:01:55.510> deck<00:01:55.780> type<00:01:56.020> formula<00:01:56.620> it's

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
your ideal deck type formula it's

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.950 
your ideal deck type formula it's
probably<00:01:57.700> going<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.060> be<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.210> deck<00:01:58.480> you'll<00:01:58.720> like

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
probably going to be a deck you'll like

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.790 
probably going to be a deck you'll like
playing<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:04.030> probably<00:02:04.840> played<00:02:05.260> some<00:02:05.560> decks

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
playing you probably played some decks

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.620 
playing you probably played some decks
that<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.100> liked<00:02:06.310> better<00:02:06.610> than<00:02:06.700> others<00:02:07.270> those

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
that you liked better than others those

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.750 
that you liked better than others those
decks<00:02:07.990> are<00:02:08.229> likely<00:02:08.890> close<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.399> your<00:02:09.520> ideal

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
decks are likely close to your ideal

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.630 
decks are likely close to your ideal
deck<00:02:10.300> type<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:10.929> as<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.260> talk<00:02:11.950> through<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.430> four

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
deck type so as I talk through the four

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.370 
deck type so as I talk through the four
factors<00:02:13.180> keep<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.750> mind<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.200> think

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
factors keep them in mind and think

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.150 
factors keep them in mind and think
