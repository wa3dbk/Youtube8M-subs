think when I tasted your chocolate cake

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.350 
think when I tasted your chocolate cake
and<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.950> asked<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:22.789> if<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.149> was<00:01:23.210> made<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.810> poo<00:01:24.110> I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
and I asked you if it was made of poo I

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.260 
and I asked you if it was made of poo I
said<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.539> as<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.720> joke<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:28.549> last<00:01:28.820> thing<00:01:29.119> I

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
said that as a joke the last thing I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.980 
said that as a joke the last thing I
expected<00:01:29.299> was<00:01:30.340> for<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.580> answer<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.090> yes<00:01:33.850> if

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
expected was for the answer to be yes if

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.450 
expected was for the answer to be yes if
there<00:01:35.990> were<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.140> list<00:01:36.289> of<00:01:36.409> five<00:01:36.649> things<00:01:36.679> that<00:01:37.039> I

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
there were a list of five things that I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.190 
there were a list of five things that I
would<00:01:37.670> change<00:01:37.970> about<00:01:38.240> what<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.780> did<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
would change about what I did in the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.880 
would change about what I did in the
competition<00:01:41.020> adding<00:01:42.020> poop<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> chocolate

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
competition adding poop to the chocolate

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.430 
competition adding poop to the chocolate
cake<00:01:43.100> would<00:01:43.610> would<00:01:44.179> definitely<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
cake would would definitely be the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.710 
cake would would definitely be the
number<00:01:45.979> one

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
number one

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.250
