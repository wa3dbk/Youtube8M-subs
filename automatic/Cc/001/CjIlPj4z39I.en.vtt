so<00:00:05.120> where<00:00:05.450> is<00:00:05.630> that<00:00:05.810> green<00:00:06.259> red<00:00:06.500> there<00:00:07.340> it<00:00:07.430> is

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:07.780 
so where is that green red there it is

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.980 
so where is that green red there it is
so<00:00:08.780> now<00:00:08.809> we're<00:00:08.990> looking<00:00:09.050> for<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.320> other

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
so now we're looking for the other

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.910 
so now we're looking for the other
he's<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.290> cube<00:00:10.580> where<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.769> there<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
he's on the cube where is there it is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.769 
he's on the cube where is there it is
right<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> we're<00:00:16.470> gonna<00:00:16.560> bring<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.779> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
right there so we're gonna bring it to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
right there so we're gonna bring it to
the<00:00:18.869> back<00:00:19.050> again<00:00:19.290> just<00:00:19.590> experiment<00:00:20.310> find<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the back again just experiment find the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.720 
the back again just experiment find the
fastest<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.610> is<00:00:23.700> right

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
fastest way for you so here it is right

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.290 
fastest way for you so here it is right
here

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
here

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.740 
here
and<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:24.599> wanted<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.020> here<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and we wanted to go here this is a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.759 
and we wanted to go here this is a
perfect<00:00:28.760> perfect<00:00:29.760> scenario<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.660> show<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> how

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
perfect perfect scenario to show you how

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.280 
perfect perfect scenario to show you how
to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.010> two<00:00:32.160> edges<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:32.900> right<00:00:33.900> there<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to do two edges at a time right there is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.650 
to do two edges at a time right there is
a<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.769> it<00:00:34.920> where<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.089> solve<00:00:36.390> two

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a way to do it where you can solve two

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.090 
a way to do it where you can solve two
edge<00:00:36.839> pieces<00:00:37.140> at<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:37.860> what

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
edge pieces at a time right now what

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.369 
edge pieces at a time right now what
we've<00:00:38.250> been<00:00:38.400> doing<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.080> bringing<00:00:40.080> this<00:00:40.320> down

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we've been doing is bringing this down

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.450 
we've been doing is bringing this down
right<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:42.030> connect<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.199> replacing<00:00:43.559> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
right to connect and then replacing this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.070 
right to connect and then replacing this
edge<00:00:44.699> with<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.239> edge<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.540> not<00:00:45.750> built<00:00:46.019> yet

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
edge with an edge that's not built yet

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.910 
edge with an edge that's not built yet
so<00:00:46.769> we<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.979> fix<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.280> center's<00:00:47.580> that<00:00:47.900> puts

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
so we can fix the center's that puts

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
so we can fix the center's that puts
some<00:00:49.920> random<00:00:50.430> piece<00:00:50.670> back<00:00:51.659> into<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
some random piece back into this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
some random piece back into this
position<00:00:52.650> when<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.100> report<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.879> fix<00:00:54.119> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
position when we report when we fix the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.430 
position when we report when we fix the
center's<00:00:54.479> I'll<00:00:54.960> show<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
center's I'll show you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.600 
center's I'll show you
whosh<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:57.089> this<00:00:57.330> red<00:00:58.320> yellow<00:00:58.530> piece<00:00:58.769> watch

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
whosh see this red yellow piece watch

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.289 
whosh see this red yellow piece watch
what<00:00:59.820> happens

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
what happens

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.000 
what happens
so<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.839> gonna<00:01:00.960> connect<00:01:01.790> these<00:01:02.790> three<00:01:03.089> right

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
so I'm gonna connect these three right

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.080 
so I'm gonna connect these three right
turn<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> side<00:01:06.740> replace<00:01:07.970> with<00:01:08.970> an

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
turn it off to the side replace with an

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.950 
turn it off to the side replace with an
edge<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.510> built<00:01:09.720> yet

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
edge it's not built yet

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
edge it's not built yet
this<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:11.400> remember<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.150> red<00:01:12.360> yellow

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this one we remember this red yellow

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.709 
this one we remember this red yellow
piece<00:01:13.700> bring<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.789> back<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.270> top<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
piece bring it back up to the top and

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.919 
piece bring it back up to the top and
fix<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.649> center's<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:18.420> red<00:01:18.689> yellow

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
fix the center's now see that red yellow

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.370 
fix the center's now see that red yellow
piece<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.899> just<00:01:21.899> got<00:01:22.020> replaced

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
piece that was here just got replaced

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.709 
piece that was here just got replaced
back<00:01:22.560> into<00:01:22.859> this<00:01:22.979> position<00:01:23.179> where<00:01:24.179> are<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
back into this position where are the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.319 
back into this position where are the
piece<00:01:24.899> that<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.109> were<00:01:25.229> working<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.560> once<00:01:25.890> was

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
piece that we were working with once was

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:53.700 
piece that we were working with once was
so<00:01:27.329> watch<00:01:28.039> ya<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> again

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.090 

okay<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.210> let's<00:01:55.840> say<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:57.070> want<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.680> we're<00:01:59.980> gonna

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
okay so let's say we want to we're gonna

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.010 
okay so let's say we want to we're gonna
do<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.370> one<00:02:00.550> right<00:02:00.760> we're<00:02:01.240> gonna<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.900> the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
do this one right we're gonna do the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.230 
do this one right we're gonna do the
green<00:02:02.320> Reds<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.860> say<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.310> want<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.700> solve

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
green Reds let's say we want to solve

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.160 
green Reds let's say we want to solve
this<00:02:07.570> green<00:02:07.990> yellow<00:02:08.140> two<00:02:08.320> at<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> same<00:02:08.619> time

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this green yellow two at the same time

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.770 
this green yellow two at the same time
let's<00:02:11.170> find<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.650> other<00:02:11.770> green<00:02:12.010> yellow<00:02:12.190> piece

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
let's find the other green yellow piece

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.010 
let's find the other green yellow piece
here<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.830> I'll<00:02:15.459> show<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.870> we

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
here it is right I'll show you what we

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.160 
here it is right I'll show you what we
want<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.800> get<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:20.709> be<00:02:20.860> right<00:02:21.310> here

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
want to do is get it to be right here

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.840 
want to do is get it to be right here
again<00:02:23.170> I'm<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.350> experiment<00:02:23.920> find<00:02:24.160> ways<00:02:24.400> to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
again I'm just experiment find ways to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.220 
again I'm just experiment find ways to
move<00:02:25.000> outer<00:02:25.209> layers<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.020> where<00:02:26.140> you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
move outer layers to get it where you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.590 
move outer layers to get it where you
need<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.560> be<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.580> here<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.850> have<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.330> green

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
need it to be so here we have this green

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.360 
need it to be so here we have this green
red<00:02:28.870> gonna<00:02:29.350> go<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.300> let's<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.690> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
red gonna go here so let's do that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.400 
red gonna go here so let's do that
and<00:02:33.370> remember<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.360> piece<00:02:34.660> should<00:02:35.170> be<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
and remember this piece should be the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.680 
and remember this piece should be the
one<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.860> needs<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.190> go<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.670> eventually<00:02:36.910> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
one that needs to go here eventually so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.610 
one that needs to go here eventually so
green<00:02:38.020> yellow<00:02:38.400> green<00:02:39.400> yellow<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> matter

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
green yellow green yellow it's a matter

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.740 
green yellow green yellow it's a matter
of<00:02:41.709> those<00:02:41.860> two<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> we're<00:02:43.270> gonna<00:02:43.360> connect<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
of those two so we're gonna connect the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.140 
of those two so we're gonna connect the
green<00:02:43.900> Reds<00:02:44.200> right<00:02:45.070> like<00:02:45.520> we<00:02:45.670> normally<00:02:45.790> do

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
green Reds right like we normally do

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.699 
green Reds right like we normally do
exactly<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.260> same<00:02:47.320> turn<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.800> off<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.100> side

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
exactly the same turn it off to the side

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.960 
exactly the same turn it off to the side
replace<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.070> an<00:02:51.190> edge<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.520> not<00:02:51.730> done

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
replace it with an edge that's not done

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.330 
replace it with an edge that's not done
but<00:02:52.180> see<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:53.110> edge<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.560> we're<00:02:53.680> replacing<00:02:53.980> it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
but see the edge that we're replacing it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.630 
but see the edge that we're replacing it
with<00:02:55.590> contains<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.770> green<00:02:57.040> yellow<00:02:57.430> right

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
with contains that green yellow right

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.720 
with contains that green yellow right
there<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.080> way<00:02:59.320> when<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.400> bring<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.700> back

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
there so that way when we bring it back

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.570 
there so that way when we bring it back
up<00:03:00.900> at<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.959> top<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.970> fix<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.299> center's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
up at the top and we fix the center's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.039 
up at the top and we fix the center's
instead<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.670> picking<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.060> random<00:03:07.269> undone<00:03:07.840> edge

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
instead of picking a random undone edge

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.560 
instead of picking a random undone edge
we<00:03:08.290> controlled<00:03:08.769> which<00:03:08.950> edge<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.280> did<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.450> that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
we controlled which edge we did so that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.330 
we controlled which edge we did so that
now<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.910> piece<00:03:13.299> from<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.680> from<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> edge

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
now this piece from the from the edge

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.960 
now this piece from the from the edge
that<00:03:15.549> was<00:03:15.670> not<00:03:15.820> built<00:03:16.030> came<00:03:16.930> back<00:03:17.080> here<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.970> at

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
that was not built came back here and at

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.610 
that was not built came back here and at
the<00:03:19.060> same<00:03:19.209> time<00:03:19.450> we<00:03:19.780> built<00:03:19.989> those<00:03:20.110> green<00:03:20.380> Reds

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the same time we built those green Reds

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.920 
the same time we built those green Reds
I'll<00:03:21.430> do<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.760> again<00:03:21.820> just<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.450> can

I'll do that again just so you can
follow<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:24.310> sure<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.730> was<00:03:24.910> very

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
follow because I'm sure that was very

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.940 
follow because I'm sure that was very
confusing<00:03:27.180> okay<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.690> let's<00:03:29.110> see<00:03:29.590> let's<00:03:29.799> pick

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
confusing okay so let's see let's pick

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.650 
confusing okay so let's see let's pick
another<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:31.739> here<00:03:32.739> we<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:33.090> blue<00:03:34.090> yellow<00:03:34.330> I

another one here we have blue yellow I
want<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.620> connect<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.010> this<00:03:36.220> blue<00:03:36.430> yellow

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
want to connect it to this blue yellow

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.539 
want to connect it to this blue yellow
Center<00:03:37.180> right<00:03:37.360> here<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.860> blue<00:03:39.100> yellow<00:03:39.280> is

Center right here this blue yellow is
sitting<00:03:39.880> next<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.630> black<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.590> blue

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
sitting next to a black and blue

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.120 
sitting next to a black and blue
centerpiece<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.480> mean<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> edge<00:03:44.769> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
centerpiece I mean on the edge the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.120 
centerpiece I mean on the edge the
center<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.510> what<00:03:47.049> we're<00:03:47.140> gonna<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.709> try<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
center so what we're gonna do is try to

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.500 
center so what we're gonna do is try to
find<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.690> black<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.709> blue<00:03:51.450> piece

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
find the black and blue piece

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.589 
find the black and blue piece
that<00:03:54.170> should<00:03:54.530> go<00:03:54.739> inside<00:03:55.700> right<00:03:58.450> here<00:03:59.450> and

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
that should go inside right here and

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.580 
that should go inside right here and
that<00:03:59.900> should<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.379> this<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:02.290> look<00:04:03.290> around

that should be this one so look around
find<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.069> piece<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.459> want<00:04:04.489> okay

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.280

this piece as you can see will

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.960 
this piece as you can see will
eventually<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:13.040> right<00:04:13.519> here

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
eventually go right here

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.289 
eventually go right here
right<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.860> what<00:04:16.039> we're<00:04:16.130> gonna<00:04:16.190> do<00:04:16.489> is<00:04:16.699> do<00:04:17.180> the

right so what we're gonna do is do the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.250 
right so what we're gonna do is do the
blue<00:04:17.449> yellows<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:17.840> normal<00:04:18.229> connect<00:04:19.239> right

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
blue yellows like normal connect right

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.680 
blue yellows like normal connect right
turn<00:04:21.260> them<00:04:21.410> off<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> side<00:04:24.850> bring<00:04:25.850> down<00:04:26.210> the

turn them off to the side bring down the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
turn them off to the side bring down the
edge<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:27.020> not<00:04:27.199> built<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.650> contains<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
edge that's not built that contains the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.620 
edge that's not built that contains the
black<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.669> blue<00:04:29.680> put<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.770> back<00:04:30.889> up<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.220> top

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
black and blue put it back up to the top

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.279 
black and blue put it back up to the top
and<00:04:34.240> fix<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> center's<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.690> way<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.110> black

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
and fix the center's that way the black

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.260 
and fix the center's that way the black
and<00:04:36.500> blue<00:04:36.680> goes<00:04:37.400> back<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:37.789> next<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
and blue goes back there next to the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.170 
and blue goes back there next to the
other<00:04:38.330> black<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.870> blue<00:04:38.960> piece<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.490> if<00:04:40.789> you

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
other black and blue piece so if you

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.689 
other black and blue piece so if you
can't<00:04:41.900> do<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.289> two<00:04:42.410> at<00:04:42.560> once<00:04:42.740> right<00:04:43.550> at<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
can't do the two at once right at the

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.400 
can't do the two at once right at the
beginning<00:04:43.789> don't<00:04:44.570> worry<00:04:44.810> it's<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.139> little<00:04:45.320> more

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
beginning don't worry it's a little more

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.500 
beginning don't worry it's a little more
confusing<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:46.010> actually<00:04:46.280> would<00:04:47.150> strongly

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
confusing I actually would strongly

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.120 
confusing I actually would strongly
recommend<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:48.139> to<00:04:48.260> only<00:04:48.380> do<00:04:48.560> one<00:04:48.590> at<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.949> time

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
recommend you to only do one at a time

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.830 
recommend you to only do one at a time
at<00:04:49.460> first<00:04:49.729> one<00:04:50.030> piece<00:04:50.210> at<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.389> time

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
at first one piece at a time

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.450 
at first one piece at a time
because<00:04:51.320> that'll<00:04:51.560> get<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> lot<00:04:51.979> used<00:04:52.220> more

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
because that'll get you a lot used more

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.279 
because that'll get you a lot used more
used<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.669> it<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.000> you'll<00:04:53.630> be<00:04:53.780> surprised<00:04:54.110> do

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
used to it and you'll be surprised do

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.560 
used to it and you'll be surprised do
that<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:55.039> week<00:04:55.250> come<00:04:55.970> back<00:04:56.150> watch<00:04:56.360> this

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
that for a week come back watch this

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.300 
that for a week come back watch this
video<00:04:56.780> again<00:04:56.960> follow<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.620> explanation<00:04:58.220> of

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
video again follow the explanation of

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.250 
video again follow the explanation of
two<00:04:58.400> at<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.550> time<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:59.330> will<00:04:59.449> seem<00:04:59.720> infinitely

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
two at a time it will seem infinitely

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.140 
two at a time it will seem infinitely
easier<00:05:00.349> much<00:05:01.160> less<00:05:01.370> confusing<00:05:03.460> alright<00:05:04.460> so

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
easier much less confusing alright so

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.469 
easier much less confusing alright so
that's<00:05:05.479> how<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:05.690> do<00:05:05.870> an<00:05:05.960> edge<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:07.760> think<00:05:08.330> that

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
that's how you do an edge I think that

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.029 
that's how you do an edge I think that
if<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.690> went<00:05:09.289> through<00:05:09.470> all<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.650> them<00:05:09.860> like<00:05:10.010> that

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
if I went through all of them like that

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.730 
if I went through all of them like that
with<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.430> out<00:05:10.610> my<00:05:10.760> tape<00:05:11.000> would<00:05:11.150> run<00:05:11.300> out<00:05:11.740> very

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
with you out my tape would run out very

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.150 
with you out my tape would run out very
quickly<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.610> I'll<00:05:13.849> do<00:05:13.970> one<00:05:14.120> more<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.570> then<00:05:15.530> I

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
quickly so I'll do one more and then I

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.159 
quickly so I'll do one more and then I
will<00:05:16.729> zoom<00:05:16.760> ahead<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.720> solving<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.110> a

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
will zoom ahead to the solving like a

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.390 
will zoom ahead to the solving like a
3x3<00:05:18.650> part<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.620> will<00:05:21.800> be<00:05:21.919> in<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.099> separate

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
3x3 part and that will be in a separate

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.020 
3x3 part and that will be in a separate
video<00:05:22.900> okay<00:05:24.039> so<00:05:25.039> here<00:05:25.250> we<00:05:25.340> have<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> blue<00:05:25.820> yellow

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
video okay so here we have a blue yellow

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.300 
video okay so here we have a blue yellow
we<00:05:27.020> wanted<00:05:27.289> to<00:05:27.349> connect<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.710> these<00:05:28.099> blue

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
we wanted to connect it to these blue

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.520 
we wanted to connect it to these blue
yos<00:05:28.490> I'll<00:05:28.880> do<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.090> single<00:05:29.449> again<00:05:29.690> only<00:05:30.110> one<00:05:30.380> at<00:05:30.470> a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
yos I'll do a single again only one at a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.439 
yos I'll do a single again only one at a
time<00:05:30.710> just<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.220> can<00:05:31.340> follow<00:05:32.260> okay<00:05:33.880> so<00:05:34.880> I'm

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
time just so you can follow okay so I'm

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.320 
time just so you can follow okay so I'm
gonna<00:05:35.539> connect<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.430> turn<00:05:37.430> off<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:37.940> side

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.800 

replace<00:05:41.330> with<00:05:41.780> an<00:05:42.050> edge<00:05:42.530> that's<00:05:42.770> not<00:05:42.889> done<00:05:43.099> yet

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
replace with an edge that's not done yet

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.310 
replace with an edge that's not done yet
put<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.900> back<00:05:45.050> up<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.760> fix<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.880> center's

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
put it back up and fix the center's

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.679 
put it back up and fix the center's
alright

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
alright

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.379 
alright
oh<00:05:49.749> actually<00:05:50.499> instead<00:05:51.489> of<00:05:51.610> zooming<00:05:51.729> ahead<00:05:52.089> to

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
oh actually instead of zooming ahead to

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.119 
oh actually instead of zooming ahead to
the<00:05:52.629> solving<00:05:52.959> it<00:05:53.049> like<00:05:53.139> a<00:05:53.169> 3x3<00:05:53.589> part<00:05:53.860> there<00:05:54.009> are

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
the solving it like a 3x3 part there are

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.789 
the solving it like a 3x3 part there are
some<00:05:54.539> some<00:05:55.539> special<00:05:55.629> cases<00:05:56.259> that<00:05:56.289> can<00:05:56.499> happen

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:56.799 
some some special cases that can happen

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:59.369 
some some special cases that can happen
with<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.669> last<00:05:57.939> sets<00:05:58.209> of<00:05:58.360> edges<00:05:58.839> when<00:05:59.199> you're

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
with the last sets of edges when you're

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.779 
with the last sets of edges when you're
when<00:05:59.889> you're<00:05:59.919> working<00:06:00.219> with<00:06:00.309> the<00:06:00.399> edges<00:06:00.639> so

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
when you're working with the edges so

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.469 
when you're working with the edges so
that<00:06:01.029> will<00:06:01.599> be<00:06:01.749> the<00:06:01.989> next<00:06:02.169> video
