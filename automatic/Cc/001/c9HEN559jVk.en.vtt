horizontally and vertically just so we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.569 
horizontally and vertically just so we
can<00:00:51.360> find<00:00:51.690> where<00:00:51.809> our<00:00:51.930> center<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.460> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
can find where our center is and when we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
can find where our center is and when we
fold<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.539> i'm<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> leave<00:00:55.350> it

folded in half so that we have a nice

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.889 
folded in half so that we have a nice
center<00:00:58.500> line<00:00:58.879> right<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> tell<00:01:00.629> us<00:01:00.750> where

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
center line right here to tell us where

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
center line right here to tell us where
everything<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.770> nice<00:01:02.430> rectangle<00:01:03.059> take<00:01:04.049> the

lift<00:01:59.770> up<00:02:00.009> from<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.400> side<00:02:00.580> there's<00:02:00.850> these<00:02:01.119> two

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
lift up from the side there's these two

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.660 
lift up from the side there's these two
parts<00:02:02.619> i'm<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:02.979> going<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> take<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> top

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
parts i'm just going to take the top

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.700 
parts i'm just going to take the top
layer<00:02:03.940> which<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.690> actually<00:02:04.840> two<00:02:05.290> parts<00:02:05.500> of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
layer which is actually two parts of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.210 
layer which is actually two parts of
paper<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.310> i'm<00:02:07.060> going<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.270> fold<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.590> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
paper and i'm going to fold up to the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.620 
paper and i'm going to fold up to the
edge<00:02:09.369> here<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.880> don't<00:02:10.000> need<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.330> make<00:02:10.450> it

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
edge here you don't need to make it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.479 
edge here you don't need to make it
perfectly<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.500> there<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.860> want<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.160> keep<00:02:12.280> a

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
perfectly up there we want to keep a

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.040 
perfectly up there we want to keep a
little<00:02:12.730> room<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.940> be<00:02:13.180> able<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.390> fold<00:02:13.600> up<00:02:13.780> from

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
little room to be able to fold up from

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870 
little room to be able to fold up from
there<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.500> there's<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.310> fold<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.760> make<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
there so there's a fold up to make a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.970 
there so there's a fold up to make a
little<00:02:16.150> triangle<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.780> then<00:02:17.650> I'm<00:02:17.769> going<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
little triangle and then I'm going to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.500 
little triangle and then I'm going to
fold<00:02:18.370> again<00:02:18.750> by<00:02:19.750> taking<00:02:20.489> all<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:22.030> layer

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
fold again by taking all of that layer

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.920 
fold again by taking all of that layer
and<00:02:23.910> creating<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.000> crease<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.239> goes<00:02:25.540> right<00:02:25.780> up

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and creating a crease that goes right up

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.710 
and creating a crease that goes right up
here<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.950> kind<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.310> start<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.910> comes

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
here and kind of start it and comes

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.080 
here and kind of start it and comes
right<00:02:28.810> down<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.709> tip<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.910> not

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
right down to this tip so it's not

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.160 
right down to this tip so it's not
bringing<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.989> edge<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.420> side<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.959> just

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
bringing the edge up to the side we just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.360 
bringing the edge up to the side we just
want<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.410> bring<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.680> down<00:02:35.709> there<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.340> that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
want to bring it down there to that

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.820 
want to bring it down there to that
corner<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:37.600> sure<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.870> get<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.080> right<00:02:38.230> kind

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
corner make sure I get that right kind

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.300 
corner make sure I get that right kind
of<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> off<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:41.910> there<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:42.970> go

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.460 

and<00:02:45.520> then<00:02:46.180> after<00:02:46.569> getting<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.930> angled<00:02:47.349> out

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
and then after getting that angled out

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.780 
and then after getting that angled out
I'm<00:02:47.620> going<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.800> take<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.099> whole<00:02:48.250> thing<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
I'm going to take the whole thing and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.809 
I'm going to take the whole thing and
fold<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.420> flush<00:02:49.780> against<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.500> edge<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.730> we

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
fold it flush against the edge that we

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.780 
fold it flush against the edge that we
have<00:02:51.970> here<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.900> green<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:54.520> we're<00:02:54.610> going<00:02:54.700> to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
have here of green so we're going to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.380 
have here of green so we're going to
fold<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.030> straight<00:02:55.330> up<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:57.150> get<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.239> right

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
fold it straight up and get it right

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.600 
fold it straight up and get it right
along<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.930> side<00:02:59.349> there<00:02:59.709> so<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.069> even<00:03:00.520> with

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
along the side there so that's even with

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.240 
along the side there so that's even with
this<00:03:00.790> edge<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.709> flip<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.980> over<00:03:03.130> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
this edge I'm going to flip it over and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.680 
this edge I'm going to flip it over and
do<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> same<00:03:03.730> thing<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.180> side<00:03:04.239> but<00:03:04.540> this

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
do the same thing on this side but this

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.640 
do the same thing on this side but this
time<00:03:04.780> we're<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.140> working<00:03:05.200> from<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
time we're going to be working from the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.410 
time we're going to be working from the
right<00:03:05.830> side<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.700> I'm<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.150> I'm<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.269> to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
right side so I'm going I'm going to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.630 
right side so I'm going I'm going to
fold<00:03:07.630> straight<00:03:08.050> up<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.500> edge<00:03:08.650> create<00:03:09.580> a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
fold straight up to that edge create a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.089 
fold straight up to that edge create a
nice<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.150> triangle<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.200> then

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
nice little triangle here and then

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.070 
nice little triangle here and then
create<00:03:12.459> another<00:03:12.730> crease<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.180> goes<00:03:13.660> from

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
create another crease that goes from

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.870 
create another crease that goes from
there<00:03:15.120> out<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.140> side<00:03:17.410> here<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:21.640> there

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
there out to this side here from there

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.250 
there out to this side here from there
take<00:03:22.299> everything<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.080> fold<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.799> straight<00:03:24.040> up

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.160 

to<00:03:29.260> create<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.590> nice<00:03:29.769> crease<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.930> that's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
to create a nice crease now that's

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.830 
to create a nice crease now that's
essentially<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.860> finished<00:03:33.489> kind<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.060> hat<00:03:34.420> now

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
essentially the finished kind of hat now

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.600 
essentially the finished kind of hat now
if<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.170> take<00:03:35.349> this<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.010> kind<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.310> open<00:03:36.580> it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
if you take this and you kind of open it

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.100 
if you take this and you kind of open it
up<00:03:36.700> from<00:03:36.910> inside<00:03:37.890> pop<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.069> open<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.630> smush

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
up from inside pop it open and smush

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.190 
up from inside pop it open and smush
down<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.590> top<00:03:41.799> part<00:03:42.250> here<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.760> create<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
down the top part here to create the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.770 
down the top part here to create the
nice<00:03:44.410> little<00:03:44.769> kind<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.069> Robin<00:03:45.819> Hood<00:03:46.030> hat<00:03:46.299> that

we would want there and that kind of is

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.770 
we would want there and that kind of is
the<00:03:51.130> finished<00:03:51.400> part<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.910> hat<00:03:52.180> at<00:03:52.480> least

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
the finished part of the hat at least

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.890 
the finished part of the hat at least
itself<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.739> then<00:03:54.489> if<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:55.000> wanted<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.630> take

here I have another one made this time
in<00:04:02.680> orange<00:04:03.069> so<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.269> same<00:04:04.480> kind<00:04:04.690> of

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
in orange so this is the same kind of

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.940 
in orange so this is the same kind of
thing<00:04:05.049> we<00:04:05.829> pop<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.370> open<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:07.030> make<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.709> we're

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
thing we pop it open to make like we're

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.500 
thing we pop it open to make like we're
making<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.340> hat<00:04:09.549> now<00:04:09.819> this<00:04:09.970> part<00:04:10.239> can<00:04:10.359> be<00:04:10.420> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
making the hat now this part can be a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.090 
making the hat now this part can be a
little<00:04:10.630> tricky<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.019> don't<00:04:11.319> want<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.769> do<00:04:11.920> this

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
little tricky you don't want to do this

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.690 
little tricky you don't want to do this
too<00:04:12.600> hard<00:04:13.600> because<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.350> part<00:04:14.739> can<00:04:14.920> tear<00:04:15.310> very

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
too hard because this part can tear very

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.870 
too hard because this part can tear very
easily<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.959> i'm<00:04:17.739> hoping<00:04:18.070> fingers<00:04:18.609> crossed

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
easily so and i'm hoping fingers crossed

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.940 
easily so and i'm hoping fingers crossed
that<00:04:19.000> this<00:04:19.180> doesn't<00:04:19.419> tear<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:19.930> me<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.260> look<00:04:20.799> at

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
that this doesn't tear for me to look at

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.010 
that this doesn't tear for me to look at
this<00:04:21.039> kind<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.310> popped<00:04:21.519> open<00:04:21.900> we're<00:04:22.900> just
