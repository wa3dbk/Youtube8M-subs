while<00:02:10.430> learning<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.820> trick<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.710> can

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
while learning this trick is so you can

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.730 
while learning this trick is so you can
go<00:02:13.010> too<00:02:13.250> far<00:02:13.490> into<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.850> blunt<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:15.500> you're

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
go too far into the blunt and if you're

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.320 
go too far into the blunt and if you're
too<00:02:15.890> far<00:02:16.100> over<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> deck<00:02:16.550> you're<00:02:17.030> not<00:02:17.210> gonna

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
too far over the deck you're not gonna

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.660 
too far over the deck you're not gonna
have<00:02:17.510> any<00:02:17.630> leverage<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.260> pop<00:02:18.470> out<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.070> you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
have any leverage to pop out so you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.590 
have any leverage to pop out so you
can't<00:02:19.850> just<00:02:19.940> gonna<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.270> mess<00:02:20.450> around

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
can't just gonna have to mess around

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.540 
can't just gonna have to mess around
with<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.260> figure<00:02:21.650> out<00:02:21.800> where<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> need<00:02:22.340> to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
with it and figure out where you need to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.280 
with it and figure out where you need to
be<00:02:22.700> usually<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> little<00:02:23.720> bit<00:02:23.810> closer<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
be usually it's a little bit closer to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.920 
be usually it's a little bit closer to
the<00:02:24.380> coping<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.330> when<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.750> push

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
the coping so that you can when you push

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.090 
the coping so that you can when you push
on<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.110> tail<00:02:27.290> your<00:02:27.470> tail<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.860> go<00:02:27.950> out

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
on the tail your tail is going to go out

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:37.020 
on the tail your tail is going to go out
it's<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> pop<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:29.840> good

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.810 

all<00:02:37.630> right<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.020> hope<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.530> helps<00:02:39.280> hopefully

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
all right so I hope that helps hopefully

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.540 
all right so I hope that helps hopefully
you<00:02:39.910> go<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.390> learn<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.050> yourself<00:02:41.550> I'm

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you go out and learn it yourself I'm

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.190 
you go out and learn it yourself I'm
trying<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.000> bunch<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.210> stuff<00:02:43.450> take<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
trying a bunch of stuff take it to the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.590 
trying a bunch of stuff take it to the
skate<00:02:44.440> park<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> pool<00:02:45.310> maybe<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.210> big-girl

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
skate park to a pool maybe a big-girl

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.540 
skate park to a pool maybe a big-girl
wall<00:02:47.640> yeah<00:02:48.640> good<00:02:48.880> luck

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
