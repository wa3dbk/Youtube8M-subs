00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.679 

let's<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.200> kind<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.740> around<00:01:23.600> let's<00:01:24.600> go

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.540 

and<00:01:30.580> then<00:01:31.090> you'd<00:01:31.570> still<00:01:31.870> have<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:32.110> nice<00:01:32.550> sr5

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.480 
and then you'd still have a nice sr5
fabric<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.990> showed<00:01:35.230> you<00:01:35.380> earlier<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.340> now<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
fabric that showed you earlier and now a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.070 
fabric that showed you earlier and now a
lot<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.700> people<00:01:36.850> realize<00:01:37.150> this<00:01:37.450> but<00:01:37.630> Toyota

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
lot of people realize this but Toyota

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.710 
lot of people realize this but Toyota
Tacomas<00:01:38.620> actually<00:01:39.400> open<00:01:39.820> up<00:01:39.940> all<00:01:40.180> four<00:01:40.450> doors

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
Tacomas actually open up all four doors

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so you can get in the back a lot easier

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.680 
so you can get in the back a lot easier
now<00:01:45.070> these<00:01:45.670> seats<00:01:45.940> are<00:01:46.060> pushed<00:01:46.270> all<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.570> way

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
do that

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.820 
do that
but<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:53.290> can<00:01:53.410> actually<00:01:53.530> make<00:01:53.800> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830

one thing I wanted to show you that's a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.340 
one thing I wanted to show you that's a
little<00:02:57.450> bit<00:02:57.600> different<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.930> inside<00:02:58.260> is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
little bit different the inside is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.320 
little bit different the inside is
actually<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.800> look<00:02:58.860> very<00:02:59.250> similar<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
actually going to look very similar to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.240 
actually going to look very similar to
the<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.840> double<00:03:01.110> cab<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.890> shown<00:03:02.070> you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the the double cab that I just shown you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.570 
the the double cab that I just shown you
previously<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:04.590> -<00:03:04.800> looks<00:03:05.130> pretty<00:03:05.459> much

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
previously the - looks pretty much

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.510 
previously the - looks pretty much
exactly<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.180> same<00:03:07.130> things<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.220> little<00:03:08.340> bit

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
exactly the same things a little bit

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.820 
exactly the same things a little bit
different<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> middle<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:10.530> far<00:03:10.560> as

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
different here in the middle as far as

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.920 
different here in the middle as far as
cupholders<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.420> most<00:03:12.540> part<00:03:12.660> it's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
cupholders but for the most part it's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.400 
cupholders but for the most part it's
very<00:03:13.170> very<00:03:13.950> similar<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:14.940> if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.110> look<00:03:16.290> up
