this is a missed opportunity and is one

of the joys of playing games like this
is<00:05:01.740> watching<00:05:02.430> your<00:05:02.550> character<00:05:03.000> grow<00:05:03.300> not<00:05:03.540> only

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
is watching your character grow not only

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.600 
is watching your character grow not only
in<00:05:03.840> terms<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.170> stats<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.560> abilities<00:05:04.980> but<00:05:05.430> also

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
in terms of stats and abilities but also

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.450 
in terms of stats and abilities but also
appearance<00:05:06.210> as<00:05:06.360> well<00:05:06.470> basically<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:08.070> game<00:05:08.220> is

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
appearance as well basically the game is

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.120 
appearance as well basically the game is
passable<00:05:09.210> at<00:05:09.420> least<00:05:09.690> in<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.560> first<00:05:10.680> half<00:05:10.950> hour

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
passable at least in the first half hour

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.560 
passable at least in the first half hour
or<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.640> thought<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.120> graphics<00:05:12.300> were

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
or so I thought the graphics were

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.050 
or so I thought the graphics were
terrible<00:05:13.260> but<00:05:13.800> subsequent<00:05:14.370> stages<00:05:14.580> provide

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
terrible but subsequent stages provide

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.420 
terrible but subsequent stages provide
colorful<00:05:15.660> scenery<00:05:15.900> even<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.070> game<00:05:17.190> as<00:05:17.400> a

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
colorful scenery even if the game as a

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
whole looks about as rough as it plays

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.110 
whole looks about as rough as it plays
it<00:05:19.710> goes<00:05:19.920> for<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.190> cartoony<00:05:20.670> aesthetics

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
it goes for a cartoony aesthetics

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.640 
it goes for a cartoony aesthetics
