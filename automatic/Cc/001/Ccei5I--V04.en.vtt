staff stand or the matter basically so

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.819 
staff stand or the matter basically so
you<00:00:21.669> get<00:00:21.970> more<00:00:22.539> range<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:23.020> motion<00:00:23.079> get<00:00:23.619> better

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
you get more range of motion get better

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.929 
you get more range of motion get better
stretch<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.369> bottom<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.500> get<00:00:26.939> there

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
stretch the bottom so you get there

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.140 
stretch the bottom so you get there

muscle stimulation up the squeeze at the
top<00:00:31.619> stretch<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.830> bottom<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:36.120> lot<00:00:37.120> easier

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
top stretch the bottom up a lot easier

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.530 
top stretch the bottom up a lot easier
to<00:00:37.600> just<00:00:37.960> start<00:00:38.949> bouncing<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.540> explosively

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
to just start bouncing and explosively

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.569 
to just start bouncing and explosively
but<00:00:41.260> if<00:00:41.350> you're<00:00:41.470> going<00:00:41.589> for<00:00:41.829> muscles<00:00:42.190> back<00:00:42.370> and
