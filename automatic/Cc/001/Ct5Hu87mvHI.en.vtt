 the bruises also known as

 10 home remedies against bruises 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.730
 first arnica 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.340
 arnica is one of the products 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.010
 most effective and popular natural 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.330

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.240
 uses therefore as a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.610
 very effective anti-inflammatory in addition to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.560
 pain reliever the above is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.250
 owes to its high content of gallic acid 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.909
 ico and chlorogenic coffee as well as elana 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.109
 lina and the wool hydro 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.109
 and your cousin too 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.260
 and I said but elena lina my mother 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.700

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.750
 blows in general because it is the ice of 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.880
 done this remedy was already used 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.250
 long in this case 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.470
 ice is effective because the cold causes 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.510
 the contraction of blood vessels and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.100
 by blood and therefore the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 beaten 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.870
 that is the second home remedy the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.520
 ice 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 the first the arnica the second the ice 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.740
 the third salt 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.180
 I was surprised by this salt 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.260
 natural product in the area of ​​the blow and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 This is going to absorb the liquid 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.000
 intercellular with what will decrease 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.849
 inflammation and pain something new that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.090
 we know 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.450
 then we have the onion 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.040
 is an option and take into account the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.260
 onion because maybe you do not have to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.110

 you have the onion at home 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.120
 the lymphatic flow and prevent the 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.190

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.910
 possible after the blow 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.430
 but if you're playing soccer and you get 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.630
 a blow like you're not going to have a 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.300

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.050
