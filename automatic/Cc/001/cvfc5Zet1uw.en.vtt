into the 8 and 16-bit days of sound
factors<00:00:07.080> they'll<00:00:07.980> let<00:00:08.160> me<00:00:08.189> present<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:09.000> new<00:00:09.150> app

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
factors they'll let me present a new app

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.160 
factors they'll let me present a new app
called<00:00:09.780> pixel<00:00:10.740> tracker<00:00:11.090> for<00:00:12.090> your<00:00:12.389> iPad<00:00:12.900> or

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170

called pixel tracker for your iPad or
iPhone<00:00:13.380> which<00:00:14.099> will<00:00:14.370> allow<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.089> that

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.460 

it's<00:00:18.840> quite<00:00:19.260> secant<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.160> quite<00:00:20.580> fun<00:00:21.260> let<00:00:22.260> me

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it's quite secant is quite fun let me

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
it's quite secant is quite fun let me
show<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:24.439> all<00:00:25.439> right<00:00:25.740> let's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
show you how to do it all right let's

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
show you how to do it all right let's
begin<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> new<00:00:26.760> song<00:00:29.510> we'll<00:00:30.510> select<00:00:30.689> new

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
begin with a new song we'll select new

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.049 
begin with a new song we'll select new
song<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:33.110> it<00:00:34.110> gives<00:00:34.440> us<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.980> variety<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
song and it gives us a variety of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.780 
song and it gives us a variety of
different<00:00:36.450> levels<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.989> complexity<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.890> guess

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
different levels of complexity I guess

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
different levels of complexity I guess
I'll<00:00:39.030> choose<00:00:39.420> 8<00:00:40.320> tracks<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.520> 16<00:00:42.059> steps<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I'll choose 8 tracks with 16 steps this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
I'll choose 8 tracks with 16 steps this
time<00:00:48.230> each<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> different<00:00:50.309> sound<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
time each one has a different sound as I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.400 
time each one has a different sound as I
usually<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.000> will<00:00:54.000> start<00:00:54.390> by<00:00:54.809> putting<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
usually do I will start by putting in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:12.740 
usually do I will start by putting in
the<00:00:55.620> drums<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> notice<00:01:11.240> by<00:01:12.240> using<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the drums and you notice by using the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
the drums and you notice by using the
piano<00:01:12.960> keyboard<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:16.590> set<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> pitch<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.580> any

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
piano keyboard we set the pitch of any

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
piano keyboard we set the pitch of any
sound<00:01:31.369> sort<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> purposefully<00:01:33.150> low<00:01:33.450> fine<00:01:34.159> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
sound sort of purposefully low fine and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
sound sort of purposefully low fine and
they<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> selection<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.600> sound<00:01:36.900> banks<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
they have a selection of sound banks you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.520 
they have a selection of sound banks you
can<00:01:37.409> load<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:39.570> believe<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.200> load<00:01:40.380> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
can load and I believe you can load in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
can load and I believe you can load in
your<00:01:40.560> own<00:01:40.860> samples<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.579> well<00:01:47.390> have<00:01:48.390> fun<00:01:48.750> how

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
your own samples as well have fun how

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:04.280 
your own samples as well have fun how
you<00:01:49.229> arrange<00:01:49.710> things

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.649 

there<00:02:05.290> are<00:02:05.470> no<00:02:05.650> time<00:02:05.920> at<00:02:06.100> all<00:02:06.190> we've<00:02:07.060> created<00:02:07.360> a

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
there are no time at all we've created a

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.940 
there are no time at all we've created a
happy<00:02:07.960> little<00:02:08.140> video<00:02:09.130> game<00:02:09.399> sounding<00:02:09.880> -<00:02:10.090> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
happy little video game sounding - I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.800 
happy little video game sounding - I
think<00:02:11.950> that's<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.970> application<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.750> very

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
think that's you the application is very

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.360 
think that's you the application is very
reasonably<00:02:17.560> priced

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
reasonably priced

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.220 
reasonably priced
you<00:02:18.700> notice<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.540> more<00:02:19.780> complicated

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
you notice we can do more complicated

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.460 
you notice we can do more complicated
sequences<00:02:21.100> -<00:02:21.370> if<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.910> by<00:02:22.690> chaining<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
sequences - if you want by chaining a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.740 
sequences - if you want by chaining a
gift<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.130> pens<00:02:24.580> together<00:02:26.940> from<00:02:27.940> within<00:02:28.570> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
gift of pens together from within the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.390 
gift of pens together from within the
sample<00:02:29.020> menu<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.930> load<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.620> single<00:02:32.680> sound

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
sample menu we can load a single sound

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.280 
sample menu we can load a single sound
or<00:02:34.209> we<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.690> load<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.050> sound<00:02:35.380> pack<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.930> they

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
or we can load a sound pack and they

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:50.750 
or we can load a sound pack and they
include<00:02:38.680> several<00:02:47.519> by<00:02:48.519> changing<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.330> sounds

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
include several by changing the sounds

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.900 
include several by changing the sounds
my<00:02:51.760> pattern<00:02:52.510> now<00:02:52.690> sounds<00:02:53.080> quite<00:02:53.260> different<00:02:53.620> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
my pattern now sounds quite different I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:16.050 
my pattern now sounds quite different I
kind<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.510> way<00:02:55.720> -<00:02:55.780> yeah<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.850> I

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
kind of like it this way - yeah if I

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.699 
kind of like it this way - yeah if I
want<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.420> see<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.780> interesting<00:03:17.290> sort<00:03:17.620> of
