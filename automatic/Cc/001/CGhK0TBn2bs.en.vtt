00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.480
 senatus it's steven is since 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.880
 several months since I got you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.309
 makes a presentation in preview 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.410
 the famous villoch ce2 tweak has finally 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.670
 updated for ayew and so follows so we're going 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.250
 to see together all that we can 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 do with the principle of this tweak it's 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 to be able to slide up on a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.350
 an app icon like these 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 to preview and be able to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 then use it without necessarily having 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 to open the application in full screen 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.920
 wait for her to charge for then 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.510
 use it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 look what it gives here with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.399
 youtube I can very well do a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 research 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.850
 and if displayed for example my channel 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.649
 youtube so it will work like that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.550
 with lots of applications it's very 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.350
 fast to use 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 so if you have just a few 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.140
 seconds to pass in an application 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 to do just one little thing very 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 fast well it can be interesting 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 to use this view of life locks and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 otherwise if we go to the settings 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 in the configuration panel of the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 tweak we have plenty of options here we have 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 example the dark mode so there I come 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 of the activated if I slide up 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 on my clock application here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 how does it look with a background rather 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.820
 black if on the other hand I disable the mode 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.710
 dark and well it will be a little bit 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 different look what it gives 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 here it is much more white so 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.229
 you have two choices you can either 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.640
 use the dark mode either you 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.590
 to deactivate is as you prefer 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 then choose here the mode 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.950
 activation so you prefer either a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 slide up on the icon one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 slide down a double tap a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 triple tap or a hold of the icon of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 the application let's say for example the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 double tap if I do on the calculator 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 here's what it gives 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.610
 so it can be a good idea to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.259
 choose this one is one of two that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 I prefer but I will leave the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 slide up on the icon 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 look for the application messages 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.290
 you see that it shows me the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 notifications while if I do it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.100
 on tweetbot and well it shows me this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.079
 this time my timeline twitter instead of 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.850
 may notification so that's a choice 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.860
 that we have either we decide to activate a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.920
 miniaturized application view like 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 these are showing his notifications 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.009
 to configure all that's going on here 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 in the settings in the life view 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.430
 locks you have here the whole list of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.960
 applications installed on your 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.799
 device so you select those 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.259
 which interest you 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.240
 take for example tweetbot precisely 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.829
 you see you have two choices be the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.349
 view of any boots be the sight 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.670
 notification here is the view of life 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.110
 locks that's ticked so what if 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.950
 I grate 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.450
 up on the icon of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.610
 the application is my twitter timeline 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.500
 which is displayed and then I can slide 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.910
 use the app as usual 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 or so I can use the view 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.480
 notification here I have none but if 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.900
 I have it displayed there as for the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.000
 sms 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.440
 how can we easily see 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 at a glance the notifications that 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.380
 we have for certain applications that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.660
 can be interesting to secure everything 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.760
 that in this life here if I tick 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.260
 tweetbot you can then choose a word 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.240
 pass that will allow me to good of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.530
 secure my application this word from 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.450
 pass will only be asked when I 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.430
 would slip with life locks or so I 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.690
 can even activate touch heidi here for 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.070
 unlock with my fingerprint 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.010
 digital watch I show you how 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.450
 it works I slide and hop on me 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 request my fingerprint before 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.510
 ability to display content 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.760
 of application I apply my thumb on 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.720
 heidi touch and now the application 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.610
 let off steam August and I can use it 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.930
 normally villa that's already 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.850
 compatible with many applications 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.590
 all those who are hasty are 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.660
 supported and many more from the app 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.489
 store like for example whatsapp you 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.959
 see here I see my notification on 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.790
 saw that it worked also with twitter 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.770
 with tweetbot you can also 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.140
 use it for example with facebook or 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.760
 still youtube here with the notes i 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.440
 for example the possibility of adding 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.910
 a very quickly 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.380
 you see the principle of this tweak it's 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.630
 really allow you to achieve 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.910
 small simple actions without necessarily 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.900
 completely open the app all to 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.400
 the time I told you that you had 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.590
 two choices is the view of the application 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.570
 either the notifications but look through 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.070
 example here with the settings you see 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.930
 that this time the display is different 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.850
 which for some applications like 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.620
 for example for sidya at sikkim poster 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.060
 the last packages and well it will be a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.130
 view a little bit more personalized this 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.959
 which is pretty cool so that's how 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.000
 that it really works an excellent 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.200
 tweak cydia is watched with the camera 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 photo I was going to forget to show you 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.910
 that but that too can be great 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 easy to quickly take a photo 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.299
 hawks city is so available for $ 2 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.739
 on cydia tell me what you have 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.610
 thought in the comments and I I 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.120
 tell you very soon for a 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.930
 next 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.930
 Hi
