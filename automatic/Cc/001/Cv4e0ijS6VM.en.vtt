let's go boom boom boom like this boom
and<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:48.000> pressing<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.600> combination<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> hard

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and I'm pressing a combination of hard

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.300 
and I'm pressing a combination of hard
and<00:01:50.220> soft<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.659> probably<00:01:52.040> one<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and soft now this is probably one of the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
and soft now this is probably one of the
simplest<00:01:53.790> ways<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.750> come<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
simplest ways that you can come up with

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.090 
simplest ways that you can come up with
to<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:55.920> clouds<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.259> boom

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to make clouds you just like so boom

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
to make clouds you just like so boom
boom<00:01:59.340> boom<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:03.409> yeah

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
boom boom and yeah

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.260 
boom boom and yeah
another<00:02:04.950> thing<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.399> try<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.700> dipping

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
another thing you could try is dipping

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.199 
another thing you could try is dipping
this<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.469> bit<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> water<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.209> dampen

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
this a little bit of water and dampen

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.279 
this a little bit of water and dampen
the<00:02:09.330> thing<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.660> gonna<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.140> bit

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the thing you're gonna get a little bit

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100 
the thing you're gonna get a little bit
different<00:02:10.709> effect<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.190> dampen<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.110> see

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
different effect if you dampen it see

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
different effect if you dampen it see
how<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.319> picked<00:02:13.560> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
how that picked up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
how that picked up
a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.280> bit<00:02:14.430> more<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:16.050> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
a little bit more what I don't want to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.190 
a little bit more what I don't want to
do<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.640> don't<00:02:17.640> want<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.850> make<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> line<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.690> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
do I don't want to make a line of I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.330 
do I don't want to make a line of I
don't<00:02:19.500> want<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.770> go<00:02:19.890> blot<00:02:20.569> blot<00:02:21.800> blot<00:02:22.800> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
don't want to just go blot blot blot and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.240 
don't want to just go blot blot blot and
have<00:02:23.940> all<00:02:24.240> my<00:02:24.450> clouds<00:02:24.750> disconnected<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.860> don't

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
have all my clouds disconnected I don't

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.920 
have all my clouds disconnected I don't
want<00:02:26.430> that's<00:02:27.390> nice

that's really neat I want to make shapes

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
that's really neat I want to make shapes

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
know I would teach my students never

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.790 
know I would teach my students never
ever<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.430> okay<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.630> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> looked

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
ever do that okay and I kind of looked

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440 
ever do that okay and I kind of looked
up<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.220> sky<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.700> said<00:02:56.910> God<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.360> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
get away with doing some of this stuff

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.460 
get away with doing some of this stuff
it's<00:02:59.040> amazing<00:02:59.420> but<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> man<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.110> nature

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
it's amazing but it is a man in nature

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.250 
it's amazing but it is a man in nature
sometimes<00:03:01.800> things<00:03:02.430> work<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.690> might<00:03:03.959> not

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
sometimes things work that might not

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.949 
sometimes things work that might not
work<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.860> well<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.310> painting<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.570> did<00:03:06.810> that

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
work so well in a painting if I did that

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.330 
work so well in a painting if I did that
in<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.380> my<00:03:07.470> paintings<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.950> would<00:03:08.130> look

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
in one of my paintings that would look

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
in one of my paintings that would look
it<00:03:09.090> wouldn't<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.570> wouldn't<00:03:09.780> look<00:03:09.989> nearly<00:03:10.320> as

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
it wouldn't it wouldn't look nearly as

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530 
it wouldn't it wouldn't look nearly as
beautiful<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.430> did<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.760> day<00:03:11.970> so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
beautiful as it did that day so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
beautiful as it did that day so
generally<00:03:13.260> speaking<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.739> try<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.040> keep<00:03:14.220> them

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
generally speaking I try and keep them

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880 
generally speaking I try and keep them
connected<00:03:14.640> now<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.510> how<00:03:15.690> by<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:16.380> by<00:03:16.830> doing

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
connected now see how by just by doing

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.910 
connected now see how by just by doing
this<00:03:17.550> not<00:03:17.910> only<00:03:18.090> did<00:03:18.329> we<00:03:18.480> put<00:03:18.690> clouds<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.350> but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
this not only did we put clouds in but

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.740 
this not only did we put clouds in but
because<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.310> press<00:03:20.820> some<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.150> them<00:03:21.420> lighter

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
because I press some of them lighter

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.979 
because I press some of them lighter
some<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.500> them<00:03:22.620> darker<00:03:23.100> there's<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.989> there's

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
some of them darker there's a there's

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.440 
some of them darker there's a there's
tone<00:03:25.310> variation<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.549> have<00:03:26.700> shadows<00:03:27.030> in

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
tone variation so you have shadows in

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.270 
tone variation so you have shadows in
the<00:03:27.540> clouds<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.200> that's<00:03:28.709> probably<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the clouds and that's probably the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.870 
the clouds and that's probably the
easiest<00:03:29.730> way<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.180> make<00:03:30.630> clouds
