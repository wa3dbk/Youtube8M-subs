00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.130
 very good I have boys and girls who 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 I am poker and today I bring you the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 next episode of the guide of the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 weapons today we're going to talk about the rpg go h 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.840
 tone gun in call of duty black ops' two 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.400
 things we never had to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 zombies a bazooka of this magnitude 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.450
 we had had the side we had had 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.189
 some other bazooka but as this does not 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.020
 has a main loader missile 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 has 20 additional chargers without 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.510
 improve and tell you that they kill very well in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010
 extremely high rounds can be 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.130
 say I tried it up in a round 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 40 and improved kills then only 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.210
 problem that the ammunition has 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160
 improve is very little improved too 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 has little and the biggest problem is that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.040
 it causes us a lot of damage if we shoot 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 up close here I try to kill them 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 normal without trying anything just this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 shot made me red as well as every 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.650
 time it affects us some damage you know 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 that we have to wait a second and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.810
 half two for us to recover from 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 everything and if we do not wait for that pass or be 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.960
 back ostia is going to hurt us and we 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.229
 let's commit suicide what happens if 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 we improve in the country the horror of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 the rpg is the rocket launcher of horror 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.929
 I really do not know what it will be called in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 Spanish and is a fucking cheto sincerely 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.719
 yes 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 for you from the hip without pointing the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.740
 shot is between quotes fast recharge 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 at eight bullets one and has 80 bullets 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 of main charger and 40 charger 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 secondary recharges all of one as 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.450
 I say if we aim it shoots twice as much 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.159
 fast as you see here from the hip 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 you have to aim but nevertheless if 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.000
 we aim as I say shoots twice as 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.679
 fast way to use it we need 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.539
 gather the zombies before you start 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.959
 use it to save good ammo 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.610
 to use it well worth drinks for 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.670
 course the quick shot to make 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.439
 much more damage not only the cadence and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.799
 prestidigitation really does not need 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.509
 since with loading one we already have the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.009
 eight go to the boys I hope that I have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.179
 liked this episode and the truth that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.179
 pretty curious where there are 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.090
 see you tomorrow with another video be 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.090
 happy and until next time
