00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
difficult i'm still mastering it and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.650 
difficult i'm still mastering it and
it's<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.950> need<00:03:11.160> loads<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.610> muscle<00:03:11.880> man

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
it's really you need loads of muscle man

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.240 
it's really you need loads of muscle man
muscle<00:03:12.780> connection<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> make<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.740> really<00:03:13.950> work

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
muscle connection to make it really work

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.360 
muscle connection to make it really work
your<00:03:14.520> chest<00:03:15.390> muscles<00:03:15.690> here<00:03:16.170> I'm<00:03:16.320> improving<00:03:17.070> on

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
your chest muscles here I'm improving on

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.160 
your chest muscles here I'm improving on
it<00:03:17.489> it's<00:03:17.700> still<00:03:17.910> difficult<00:03:18.150> though<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.780> did

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it it's still difficult though I did

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.940 
it it's still difficult though I did
five<00:03:19.530> sets<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.310> 12<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:22.170> again<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> failed

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
five sets of 12 and but again I failed

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
five sets of 12 and but again I failed
on<00:03:23.280> i<00:03:23.340> think<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.850> 10th<00:03:24.120> fret<00:03:24.360> on<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:25.320> fifth<00:03:25.590> set

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
on i think the 10th fret on my fifth set

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.250 
on i think the 10th fret on my fifth set
so<00:03:26.040> i'm<00:03:26.100> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.250> drop<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.489> way<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.730> down<00:03:26.940> in

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
so i'm going to drop the way it down in

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.510 
so i'm going to drop the way it down in
