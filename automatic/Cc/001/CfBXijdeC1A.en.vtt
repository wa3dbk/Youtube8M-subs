00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.350 
those something wrong but others you
know<00:03:38.110> there's<00:03:38.590> still<00:03:38.770> quite<00:03:39.010> shy<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.760> they

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
know there's still quite shy and they

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.600 
know there's still quite shy and they
probably<00:03:40.620> more<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.739> type<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.980> keep<00:03:42.370> something

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
probably more the type of keep something

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.300 
probably more the type of keep something
in<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.120> think<00:03:43.270> an<00:03:43.870> event<00:03:44.200> like<00:03:44.350> today<00:03:44.709> I'll

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
in so I think an event like today I'll

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.510 
in so I think an event like today I'll
just<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:46.510> allow<00:03:47.320> them<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.830> access<00:03:47.860> more

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
just you know allow them to access more

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.460
