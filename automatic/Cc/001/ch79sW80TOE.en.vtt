minimalistic yet functional look and
feel<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:34.020> small<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.500> looks<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
feel and how small it looks on the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
feel and how small it looks on the
outside<00:00:35.130> even<00:00:35.670> though<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> pretty

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
outside even though it has a pretty

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.959 
outside even though it has a pretty
large<00:00:36.750> terior<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.309> start<00:00:38.579> off<00:00:38.760> with

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
large terior but let's start off with

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.319 
large terior but let's start off with
the<00:00:39.000> actual<00:00:39.360> purpose<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.230> station<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:41.329> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the actual purpose of this station as I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
the actual purpose of this station as I
understood<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.379> platform<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.010> designed

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
understood it this platform is designed

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
understood it this platform is designed
to<00:00:44.460> defend<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.940> area<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.510> small<00:00:45.840> enemy

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to defend an area from small enemy

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.220 
to defend an area from small enemy
forces<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.820> serving<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.809> central

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
forces as well as serving as a central

forces as well as serving as a central
docking<00:00:49.620> half<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.010> frigates<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.610> other<00:00:50.910> large

docking half of frigates or other large

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.350 
docking half of frigates or other large
ships<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> resupply<00:00:52.879> since<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.149> not

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
ships to resupply since it is not

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970 
ships to resupply since it is not
designed<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> encounter<00:00:55.350> large<00:00:55.530> enemy<00:00:55.829> force

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
designed to encounter large enemy force

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.970 
designed to encounter large enemy force
this<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.910> relatively<00:00:57.390> light<00:00:57.629> armed<00:00:58.020> also

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
this it is relatively light armed also

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
this it is relatively light armed also
it<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.760> suited<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> self-sustained

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it is not suited for a self-sustained

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
it is not suited for a self-sustained
way<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> operations<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
way of operations so it has to be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.350 
way of operations so it has to be
resupplied<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.049> fleet<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.119> use

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
resupplied by the fleet but it can use

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
resupplied by the fleet but it can use
its<00:01:06.390> own<00:01:06.960> resources<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.860> assemble<00:01:08.310> needed

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
its own resources to assemble needed

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.260 
its own resources to assemble needed
components<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.270> smaller<00:01:09.600> repairs<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> far<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
components for smaller repairs so far so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
components for smaller repairs so far so
good<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.470> opinion<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.430> station<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
good and in my opinion this station is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
good and in my opinion this station is
pretty<00:01:15.299> much<00:01:15.479> suited<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.140> everything<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pretty much suited for everything it is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
pretty much suited for everything it is
designed<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> interior<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
designed for now for the interior and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
designed for now for the interior and
the<00:01:19.020> overall<00:01:19.320> features<00:01:19.830> first<00:01:20.220> off<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.729> really

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the overall features first off I really

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
the overall features first off I really
liked<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> station<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> presented<00:01:22.710> in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
liked how the station is presented in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
liked how the station is presented in
the<00:01:22.920> workshop<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the workshop as well as all the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
the workshop as well as all the
guideposts<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.110> over<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> place<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> didn't

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
guideposts all over the place I didn't

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
guideposts all over the place I didn't
feel<00:01:26.640> lost<00:01:26.880> once<00:01:27.150> since<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:27.960> always

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
feel lost once since there was always

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.370 
feel lost once since there was always
something<00:01:28.650> telling<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.310> where<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:29.880> am

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
something telling me where I actually am

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.510 
something telling me where I actually am
that<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.130> more<00:01:32.340> people

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that is something that more people

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
that is something that more people
should<00:01:32.820> consider<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.329> uploading<00:01:33.810> something

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
should consider when uploading something

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
should consider when uploading something
to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> workshop<00:01:35.390> also<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> virtual<00:01:37.079> page

plans to take a look at the station from

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
plans to take a look at the station from
different<00:01:41.640> angles<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> author<00:01:43.140> ever

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439

version<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> station<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:47.220> highly

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
version of the station I would highly

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
version of the station I would highly
suggest<00:01:47.579> making<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.600> plans<00:01:48.869> Ltd<00:01:49.500> textures

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
suggest making those plans Ltd textures

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.359 
suggest making those plans Ltd textures
that<00:01:50.939> would<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.600> awesome<00:01:52.220> ok<00:01:53.220> what

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that would be really awesome ok what

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.130 
that would be really awesome ok what
else<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.509> total<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
else do we get we get in total of two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.350 
else do we get we get in total of two
hangars<00:01:55.530> equipped<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.070> fitting<00:01:56.399> ships<00:01:56.670> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
shared the same pressure very nice

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.390 
shared the same pressure very nice
indeed<00:03:09.720> okay<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.959> guess<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:11.920> all<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.280> this
