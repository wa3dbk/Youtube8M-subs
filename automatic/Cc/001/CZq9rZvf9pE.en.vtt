different sized boats so there's not one
anchor<00:01:52.069> road<00:01:52.279> that<00:01:52.520> works<00:01:52.729> well<00:01:53.029> or<00:01:53.509> perfect

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
anchor road that works well or perfect

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.989 
anchor road that works well or perfect
for<00:01:54.079> everybody<00:01:54.319> so<00:01:55.099> today<00:01:55.459> we<00:01:55.609> want<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.880> talk

for everybody so today we want to talk

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.480 
for everybody so today we want to talk
about<00:01:56.149> four<00:01:56.689> primary<00:01:57.259> combinations<00:01:58.219> of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
about four primary combinations of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.940 
about four primary combinations of
anchor<00:01:59.060> roads<00:01:59.299> okay<00:01:59.749> but<00:02:00.469> all<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.709> them<00:02:00.859> are

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
anchor roads okay but all of them are

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.830 
anchor roads okay but all of them are
really<00:02:01.039> comprised<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.700> two<00:02:01.880> things<00:02:02.179> one<00:02:02.509> is

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
really comprised of two things one is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.069 
really comprised of two things one is
using<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.499> high<00:02:03.770> quality<00:02:04.069> three<00:02:04.700> strand<00:02:05.090> nylon

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
using a high quality three strand nylon

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.050 
using a high quality three strand nylon
anchor<00:02:06.590> line<00:02:06.829> like<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:07.639> have<00:02:07.759> from<00:02:07.939> New

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
anchor line like we have from New

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.910 
anchor line like we have from New
England<00:02:08.090> ropes<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.989> second<00:02:09.349> is<00:02:09.440> using<00:02:09.619> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
England ropes and the second is using a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.850 
England ropes and the second is using a
high<00:02:10.280> quality<00:02:10.750> hot-dip<00:02:11.750> galvanized<00:02:12.380> chain

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
high quality hot-dip galvanized chain

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.130 
high quality hot-dip galvanized chain
like<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.670> have<00:02:13.819> from<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.120> KO<00:02:14.330> what<00:02:14.750> rule<00:02:14.989> of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
like we have from a KO what rule of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.770 
like we have from a KO what rule of
thumb<00:02:15.380> would<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.770> use<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.330> selecting<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
thumb would you use in selecting the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.710 
thumb would you use in selecting the
size<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.710> anchor<00:02:19.400> line<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.030> know<00:02:20.150> for<00:02:20.510> many

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
size of anchor line you know for many

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600 
size of anchor line you know for many
many<00:02:21.020> years<00:02:21.080> we've<00:02:21.530> used<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.280> simple

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
many years we've used a really simple

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.619 
many years we've used a really simple
rule<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.150> it's

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
rule and it's

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.569 
rule and it's
stood<00:02:23.989> up<00:02:24.140> extremely<00:02:24.469> well<00:02:24.709> over<00:02:25.099> those<00:02:25.249> years

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
stood up extremely well over those years

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.849 
stood up extremely well over those years
and<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.299> is<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.719> size<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.409> anchor<00:02:27.709> line

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
and that is that to size the anchor line

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.800 
and that is that to size the anchor line
you<00:02:28.519> use<00:02:28.700> an<00:02:28.879> eighth<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.209> an<00:02:29.359> inch<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.629> diameter

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
you use an eighth of an inch of diameter

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.720 
you use an eighth of an inch of diameter
of<00:02:30.230> anchor<00:02:30.530> line<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:30.980> every<00:02:31.159> nine<00:02:31.370> feet<00:02:31.700> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
of anchor line for every nine feet of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.910 
of anchor line for every nine feet of
boat<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.079> does<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.200> mean<00:02:33.379> well<00:02:33.799> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
boat now what does that mean well it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.559 
boat now what does that mean well it
means<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.219> you<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> three-eighths<00:02:35.060> inch

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
means if you have a three-eighths inch

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.929 
means if you have a three-eighths inch
anchor<00:02:36.200> line<00:02:36.409> that<00:02:36.980> will<00:02:37.159> work<00:02:37.340> for<00:02:37.579> boats<00:02:37.760> up

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
anchor line that will work for boats up

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.869 
anchor line that will work for boats up
to<00:02:38.060> about<00:02:38.239> 27<00:02:38.810> feet<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.469> if<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.159> have<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> 5/8

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
to about 27 feet and if you have a 5/8

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.429 
to about 27 feet and if you have a 5/8
inch<00:02:41.030> anchor<00:02:41.389> line<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.810> will<00:02:41.959> go<00:02:42.079> up<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.319> as

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
inch anchor line that will go up to as

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.770 
inch anchor line that will go up to as
high<00:02:42.469> as<00:02:42.650> 45<00:02:43.310> feet<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:44.359> there<00:02:44.599> are<00:02:44.659> always

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
high as 45 feet now there are always

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.149 
high as 45 feet now there are always
exceptions<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.889> you<00:02:45.980> have<00:02:46.069> an

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
exceptions to this if you have an

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.619 
exceptions to this if you have an
extremely<00:02:46.459> lightweight<00:02:46.939> boat<00:02:47.359> or<00:02:47.569> an

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
extremely lightweight boat or an

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.869 
extremely lightweight boat or an
extremely<00:02:47.959> heavy<00:02:48.290> boat<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:49.099> basic<00:02:49.669> rule

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
extremely heavy boat but that basic rule

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.550 
extremely heavy boat but that basic rule
of<00:02:50.090> an<00:02:50.209> eighth<00:02:50.359> of<00:02:50.480> an<00:02:50.599> inch<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.870> diameter<00:02:51.049> for

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
of an eighth of an inch of diameter for

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.349 
of an eighth of an inch of diameter for
every<00:02:51.709> nine<00:02:51.889> feet<00:02:52.159> of<00:02:52.280> boat<00:02:52.430> length<00:02:52.669> seems<00:02:53.209> to

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
every nine feet of boat length seems to

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.059 
every nine feet of boat length seems to
work<00:02:53.540> really<00:02:53.569> well<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.530> Chuck<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.889> very

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
work really well so Chuck is very

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.679 
work really well so Chuck is very
similar<00:02:55.400> rule<00:02:55.819> of<00:02:55.969> thumb<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.299> would<00:02:56.450> use<00:02:56.659> for

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
similar rule of thumb we would use for

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.869 
similar rule of thumb we would use for
sizing<00:02:57.230> chain<00:02:57.500> yeah<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.400> one's<00:02:58.609> really

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
sizing chain yeah and this one's really

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.849 
sizing chain yeah and this one's really
simple<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.599> simply<00:02:59.959> use<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.379> chain<00:03:00.620> size

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
simple you simply use the chain size

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.009 
simple you simply use the chain size
that's<00:03:01.129> half<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> size<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.150> rope<00:03:02.359> so<00:03:02.810> for

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
that's half the size of the rope so for

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.599 
that's half the size of the rope so for
example<00:03:03.379> if<00:03:03.469> you're<00:03:03.620> using<00:03:03.650> 1/2<00:03:04.129> inch<00:03:04.340> rope

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
example if you're using 1/2 inch rope

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.369 
example if you're using 1/2 inch rope
you'd<00:03:05.000> use<00:03:05.030> quarter<00:03:05.569> inch<00:03:05.719> chain<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.290> that

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
you'd use quarter inch chain and that

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.159 
you'd use quarter inch chain and that
works<00:03:06.739> well<00:03:07.040> over<00:03:07.849> really<00:03:08.239> any<00:03:08.419> size<00:03:08.659> of<00:03:08.959> line

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
works well over really any size of line

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.979 
works well over really any size of line
and<00:03:09.439> chain<00:03:09.889> ok<00:03:10.879> so<00:03:10.939> here's<00:03:11.269> another<00:03:11.510> equally

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
and chain ok so here's another equally

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
and chain ok so here's another equally
important<00:03:12.439> question<00:03:12.799> how<00:03:13.400> long<00:03:13.459> should<00:03:14.449> my

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
important question how long should my

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.959 
important question how long should my
anchor<00:03:14.989> line<00:03:15.199> be<00:03:15.439> it's<00:03:16.159> a<00:03:16.219> good<00:03:16.400> question<00:03:16.790> and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
anchor line be it's a good question and

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.670 
anchor line be it's a good question and
you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.299> classic<00:03:17.780> answer<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.439> is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you know the classic answer to that is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.039 
you know the classic answer to that is
that<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:18.919> need<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.159> use<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> scope<00:03:19.939> of<00:03:20.209> 7<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.870> 1

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
that you need to use a scope of 7 to 1

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.740 
that you need to use a scope of 7 to 1
well<00:03:21.319> what<00:03:21.469> does<00:03:21.620> scope<00:03:22.159> mean<00:03:22.419> scope<00:03:23.419> is<00:03:23.599> where

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
well what does scope mean scope is where

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.179 
well what does scope mean scope is where
you<00:03:23.900> look<00:03:24.049> at<00:03:24.199> the<00:03:24.230> depth<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> water<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
you look at the depth of the water the

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.069 
you look at the depth of the water the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
freeboard of your boat and multiply it

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
anchor line ought to be this works

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.819 
anchor line ought to be this works
really<00:03:32.840> really<00:03:32.989> well<00:03:33.259> but<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:33.739> a

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
really really well but it's a

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.830 
really really well but it's a
conservative<00:03:34.220> rule<00:03:34.669> and<00:03:34.939> you<00:03:35.269> may<00:03:35.419> find<00:03:35.659> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
conservative rule and you may find that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.569 
conservative rule and you may find that
you<00:03:35.989> can<00:03:36.139> get<00:03:36.290> away<00:03:36.379> with<00:03:36.680> five<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.129> one<00:03:37.280> scope

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
you can get away with five to one scope

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.800 
you can get away with five to one scope
although<00:03:37.909> you<00:03:37.970> may<00:03:38.150> have<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.449> add<00:03:38.569> additional

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
although you may have to add additional

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.979 
although you may have to add additional
vigilance<00:03:39.590> or<00:03:39.769> additional<00:03:40.430> change<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.840> this

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
vigilance or additional change so this

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.809 
vigilance or additional change so this
is<00:03:42.139> perhaps<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.620> simplest<00:03:42.919> anchor<00:03:43.340> road<00:03:43.519> set

even<00:04:04.879> more<00:04:05.060> effective<00:04:05.479> you<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:06.049> want<00:04:06.229> to

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
even more effective you really want to

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.039 
even more effective you really want to
add<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.859> piece<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.639> chain<00:04:07.909> between<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.689> anchor

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
add a piece of chain between the anchor

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.800 
add a piece of chain between the anchor
and<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.769> anchor<00:04:10.310> line<00:04:10.489> now<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.479> general<00:04:11.780> rule

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
and the anchor line now the general rule

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.869 
and the anchor line now the general rule
of<00:04:11.959> thumb<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.409> use<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:13.069> length<00:04:13.699> of<00:04:13.849> chain

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
of thumb is to use a length of chain

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.659 
of thumb is to use a length of chain
equivalent<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.719> the<00:04:14.900> boat<00:04:15.109> length<00:04:15.409> so<00:04:15.769> 24<00:04:16.489> foot

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
equivalent to the boat length so 24 foot

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.180 
equivalent to the boat length so 24 foot
boat<00:04:16.880> would<00:04:17.090> use<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> 24<00:04:17.840> foot<00:04:17.870> length<00:04:18.680> piece<00:04:19.039> of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
boat would use a 24 foot length piece of

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.189 
boat would use a 24 foot length piece of
chain<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.909> know<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.389> really<00:04:20.900> a

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
chain you know this is a really a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.649 
chain you know this is a really a
time-honored<00:04:22.159> suggestion<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.240> one<00:04:23.449> boat

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
time-honored suggestion of one boat

time-honored suggestion of one boat
length<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:24.020> chain<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.560> maximize<00:04:25.039> your<00:04:25.219> holding

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
length of chain to maximize your holding

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.430 
length of chain to maximize your holding
power<00:04:25.639> in<00:04:25.849> fact<00:04:26.389> people<00:04:26.599> will<00:04:26.900> use<00:04:27.050> all<00:04:27.259> sorts

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
power in fact people will use all sorts

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.409 
power in fact people will use all sorts
of<00:04:27.650> different<00:04:28.039> lengths<00:04:28.340> but<00:04:28.490> if<00:04:28.699> you<00:04:29.090> had<00:04:29.300> to

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
of different lengths but if you had to

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.700 
of different lengths but if you had to
choose<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.690> sort<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.199> general<00:04:30.229> rule<00:04:30.680> of

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
choose just sort of a general rule of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.469 
choose just sort of a general rule of
thumb<00:04:30.860> that's<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.310> pretty<00:04:31.490> good<00:04:31.699> one<00:04:31.849> now<00:04:32.419> to

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
thumb that's a pretty good one now to

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.700 
thumb that's a pretty good one now to
connect<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.020> you're<00:04:33.199> going<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.380> need<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.680> use

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
connect it you're going to need to use

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.820 
connect it you're going to need to use
shackle<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:35.840> want<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.110> use<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.409> sizing

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
shackle and you want to use the sizing

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.450 
shackle and you want to use the sizing
up<00:04:36.949> rule<00:04:37.190> so

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
up rule so

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.180 
up rule so
whatever<00:04:37.669> size<00:04:37.970> anchor<00:04:38.539> chain<00:04:38.780> you're<00:04:38.960> using

let's<00:04:40.190> say<00:04:40.280> it's<00:04:40.400> 5/16<00:04:41.120> chain<00:04:41.389> then<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:41.960> want

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
let's say it's 5/16 chain then you want

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.439 
let's say it's 5/16 chain then you want
to<00:04:42.350> use<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.770> 3/8<00:04:43.250> shackle<00:04:43.759> and<00:04:43.910> obviously

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
to use a 3/8 shackle and obviously

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.670 
to use a 3/8 shackle and obviously
you're<00:04:44.539> going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.720> use<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> shackle<00:04:45.319> between

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
you're going to use a shackle between

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.589 
you're going to use a shackle between
the<00:04:45.949> chain<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.669> anchor<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.509> use

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
the chain and the anchor you can use

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.659 
the chain and the anchor you can use
another<00:04:47.810> shackle<00:04:48.319> between<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.919> chain<00:04:49.370> and

another shackle between the chain and

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.539 
another shackle between the chain and
the<00:04:50.060> anchor<00:04:50.330> line
