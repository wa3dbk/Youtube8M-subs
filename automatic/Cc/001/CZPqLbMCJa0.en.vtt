past<00:02:25.060> games<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> great<00:02:26.470> idea

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
past games I think that is a great idea

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.010 
past games I think that is a great idea
it's<00:02:27.070> also<00:02:27.190> interesting<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> true<00:02:28.420> too

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
it's also interesting if it is true too

it's also interesting if it is true too
kind<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.410> speculate<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.430> kind<00:02:30.640> of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
kind of speculate on what kind of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.460 
kind of speculate on what kind of
interactions<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.600> she'll<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:32.050> with<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
interactions that she'll have with the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
my opinion in pokemon X&amp;Y she was kind

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.130

and then she disappeared for a long time

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.200 
and then she disappeared for a long time
in<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.310> game<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.580> didn't<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:42.910> see<00:02:43.090> her

all that too often and then all of a
sudden<00:02:45.040> right<00:02:45.490> at<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.700> end<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> game<00:02:46.030> it's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
sudden right at the end of the game it's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.030 
sudden right at the end of the game it's
almost<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> surprise<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.830> actually

omega ruby and alpha sapphire hopefully

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.000 
omega ruby and alpha sapphire hopefully
she<00:02:55.300> can<00:02:55.420> have<00:02:55.600> some<00:02:55.900> better<00:02:56.170> communications

know<00:03:12.070> for<00:03:12.100> crying<00:03:12.520> out<00:03:12.610> loud<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.480> just

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
know for crying out loud but it's just

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.840 
know for crying out loud but it's just
still<00:03:13.900> fun<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.230> kind<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.620> speculate<00:03:15.220> on<00:03:15.370> what

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
still fun to kind of speculate on what

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.640 
still fun to kind of speculate on what
kind<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.420> guess<00:03:16.480> effect<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.380> they<00:03:17.530> have

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
kind of I guess effect that they have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.530 
kind of I guess effect that they have
the<00:03:17.830> could<00:03:18.010> have<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.460> these<00:03:18.580> remakes<00:03:18.970> just

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the could have in these remakes just

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.840 
the could have in these remakes just
because<00:03:19.810> she<00:03:19.960> has<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.410> much<00:03:20.470> utility<00:03:21.010> in<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
because she has so much utility in the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.130 
because she has so much utility in the
character<00:03:22.240> of<00:03:22.360> who<00:03:22.540> she<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.750> again<00:03:23.080> very

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
character of who she is again very

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.050 
character of who she is again very
strong<00:03:23.680> trainer<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.160> mega<00:03:24.310> evolution<00:03:24.880> mega

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
strong trainer in mega evolution mega

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.850 
strong trainer in mega evolution mega
evolution<00:03:25.930> already<00:03:26.230> confirmed<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.680> these

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
evolution already confirmed in these

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380 
evolution already confirmed in these
games<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.340> think<00:03:27.850> there's<00:03:28.060> going<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.240> be<00:03:28.300> a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
games I think there's going to be a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.630 
games I think there's going to be a
great<00:03:28.660> driving<00:03:29.140> force<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:29.830> she<00:03:29.950> does<00:03:30.160> appear

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
great driving force if she does appear

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.520 
great driving force if she does appear
in<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.910> remakes<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.360> also<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> now<00:03:32.320> that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
in the remakes and also to now that

in<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.450> form<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.930> Pokemon<00:04:02.560> Delta<00:04:03.040> mo<00:04:03.220> which<00:04:03.550> is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
in the form of Pokemon Delta mo which is

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.490 
in the form of Pokemon Delta mo which is
really<00:04:03.910> interesting<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.630> terms<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.140> rumor

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
really interesting in terms of a rumor

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.110 
really interesting in terms of a rumor
because<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.280> would<00:04:06.430> be<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.610> first<00:04:06.640> time

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
because this would be the first time

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.140 
because this would be the first time
that<00:04:07.180> Nintendo<00:04:07.870> would<00:04:08.380> remake<00:04:08.770> a<00:04:08.980> third<00:04:09.520> game

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that Nintendo would remake a third game

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
that Nintendo would remake a third game
in<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.600> Pokemon<00:04:11.080> series<00:04:11.290> remember<00:04:11.709> there<00:04:12.280> was

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
in a Pokemon series remember there was

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.970 
in a Pokemon series remember there was
never<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.970> remake<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.600> pokemon<00:04:14.200> yellow<00:04:14.380> nor<00:04:14.800> was

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
never a remake of pokemon yellow nor was

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.740 
never a remake of pokemon yellow nor was
there<00:04:15.100> ever<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.459> remake<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:15.970> pokemon<00:04:16.540> crystal

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
there ever a remake of pokemon crystal

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.930 
there ever a remake of pokemon crystal
so<00:04:17.410> again<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.160> first<00:04:18.370> time<00:04:18.489> Nintendo

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
so again this be the first time Nintendo

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.909 
so again this be the first time Nintendo
would<00:04:19.090> ever<00:04:19.209> do<00:04:19.420> something<00:04:19.660> like<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.350> I

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
would ever do something like this and I

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.740 
would ever do something like this and I
guess<00:04:21.100> at<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.310> point<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:21.850> would<00:04:21.970> be<00:04:22.090> simple<00:04:22.570> a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
guess at that point it would be simple a

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.510 
guess at that point it would be simple a
Steven<00:04:23.350> stone<00:04:23.530> would<00:04:23.710> be<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.890> champion<00:04:24.430> of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
Steven stone would be the champion of

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.500 
Steven stone would be the champion of
Pokemon<00:04:24.970> Omega

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
Pokemon Omega

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.270 
Pokemon Omega
being<00:04:25.720> alpha<00:04:25.870> sapphire<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:27.040> course

being alpha sapphire and of course

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.490 
being alpha sapphire and of course
Wallace<00:04:27.850> would<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> champion<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.840> Pokemon

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
Wallace would be the champion of Pokemon

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.740
