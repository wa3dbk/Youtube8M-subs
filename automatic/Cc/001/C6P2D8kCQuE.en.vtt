some internal standards tests it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
some internal standards tests it's
checking<00:01:22.710> certain<00:01:23.220> things<00:01:23.460> but

checking certain things but

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
everything that it should check then it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.870 
everything that it should check then it
does<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> calibration<00:01:28.470> check<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.670> the

does a calibration check right now the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
does a calibration check right now the
instrument<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.600> checking<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.409> against<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
instrument is checking to see against a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.399 
instrument is checking to see against a
100<00:01:32.490> alcohol<00:01:32.909> standard<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.900> close<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
100 alcohol standard how close the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
100 alcohol standard how close the
instrument<00:01:34.920> comes<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.520> standard<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
instrument comes to that standard and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
instrument comes to that standard and
we're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> reading<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
we're going to get a reading of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.260 
we're going to get a reading of
somewhere<00:01:38.400> around<00:01:38.549> 96<00:01:39.420> milligrams

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
somewhere around 96 milligrams

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.959 
somewhere around 96 milligrams
100<00:01:40.630> mils<00:01:40.810> which<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.170> pretty<00:01:41.350> close<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.680> 100<00:01:42.340> so

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
100 mils which is pretty close to 100 so

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.700 
100 mils which is pretty close to 100 so
for<00:01:43.210> all<00:01:43.329> intents<00:01:43.359> and<00:01:43.689> purposes<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.320> appears

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
for all intents and purposes it appears

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.520 
for all intents and purposes it appears
that<00:01:44.979> this<00:01:45.399> instrument<00:01:45.909> is<00:01:45.969> working<00:01:46.359> well<00:01:46.539> in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
that this instrument is working well in

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.230 
that this instrument is working well in
fact<00:01:47.799> we're<00:01:48.460> actually<00:01:48.670> getting<00:01:49.030> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
fact we're actually getting a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.330 
fact we're actually getting a
calibration<00:01:49.689> check<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.170> 99<00:01:50.619> milligrams<00:01:51.100> per

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
calibration check of 99 milligrams per

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.059 
calibration check of 99 milligrams per
100<00:01:51.759> mils<00:01:51.939> so<00:01:52.450> looks<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.110> police<00:01:53.439> or<00:01:53.710> to

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
100 mils so looks to the police or to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.950 
100 mils so looks to the police or to
the<00:01:54.189> operator<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.789> machining<00:01:55.270> like<00:01:55.750> it's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
the operator of the machining like it's

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.830 
the operator of the machining like it's
working<00:01:56.140> very<00:01:56.380> very<00:01:56.740> well<00:01:57.189> but<00:01:58.149> what<00:01:58.329> happens

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
working very very well but what happens

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.380 
working very very well but what happens
if<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.649> person<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.310> no<00:02:00.549> alcohol<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:01.270> their
