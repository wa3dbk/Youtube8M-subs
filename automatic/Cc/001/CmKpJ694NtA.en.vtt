00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
discussion on this topic it's not as big

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.229 
as a topic i would say well hopefully
bigger<00:00:56.040> topic<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> grand<00:00:56.940> scheme<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
bigger topic in the grand scheme of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
bigger topic in the grand scheme of
things<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.380> not<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> heated

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
things but it's probably not as a heated

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110 
things but it's probably not as a heated
as<00:00:59.910> topic<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:01.440> other<00:01:01.980> topic<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.850> i<00:01:02.880> did

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
as topic as the other topic that i did

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
as topic as the other topic that i did
but<00:01:03.600> i<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:04.140> think<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.770> very

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but i do think this is a very

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
but i do think this is a very
interesting<00:01:05.040> topic<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.940> I'd<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> see

is<00:02:01.229> something<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.650> WWE<00:02:02.310> might<00:02:02.580> actually<00:02:02.909> do

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is something that WWE might actually do

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
is something that WWE might actually do
which<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.869> course<00:02:03.900> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> limit<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.710> lot

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
which is of course going to limit a lot

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.960 
which is of course going to limit a lot
of<00:02:04.890> things<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> lot<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.729> people<00:02:05.790> are

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
of things I think a lot of people are

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.479 
of things I think a lot of people are
going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.150> come<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> same<00:02:07.160> idea<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
going to come up with the same idea but

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.520 
going to come up with the same idea but
I<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:11.870> an<00:02:12.870> interesting<00:02:13.079> idea

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I do think it's an interesting idea

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.979 
I do think it's an interesting idea
because<00:02:14.130> there's<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.329> lot<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
because there's just not a lot there you
