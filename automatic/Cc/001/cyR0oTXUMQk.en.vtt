shown<00:00:58.520> in<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.760> movies<00:00:59.060> so<00:00:59.240> he<00:00:59.330> kind<00:00:59.570> of

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
shown in the movies so he kind of

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.050 
shown in the movies so he kind of
created<00:00:59.930> purpose<00:01:00.230> for<00:01:00.410> them<00:01:00.560> and<00:01:00.950> we'll<00:01:01.940> we'll

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
created purpose for them and we'll we'll

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.520 
created purpose for them and we'll we'll
decide<00:01:02.330> specifically<00:01:02.930> because<00:01:03.080> there<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.380> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
decide specifically because there is the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.509 
decide specifically because there is the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
up section

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.690

it<00:01:10.090> also<00:01:10.240> doesn't<00:01:10.480> really<00:01:10.750> explain<00:01:10.900> how<00:01:11.020> they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
it also doesn't really explain how they

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.230 
it also doesn't really explain how they
got<00:01:11.350> doing<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.710> movie<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.190> losing<00:01:12.790> room<00:01:13.030> for

a<00:01:15.500> large<00:01:16.219> portion<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> map<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.360> matter

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
a large portion the map like the matter

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.120 
a large portion the map like the matter
is<00:01:17.689> still<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:18.200> constantly<00:01:18.649> I<00:01:18.770> guess<00:01:18.920> under

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
is still like constantly I guess under

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.969 
is still like constantly I guess under
construction<00:01:19.909> all<00:01:20.030> that

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
construction all that

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.719 
construction all that
and<00:01:22.070> improved<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.299> enhanced

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.660 

and<00:01:25.939> will<00:01:26.329> constantly<00:01:26.659> be<00:01:27.049> changing<00:01:27.200> yes

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
and will constantly be changing yes

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.770 
and will constantly be changing yes
that's<00:01:28.670> always<00:01:28.820> new

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's always new

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
that's always new
and<00:01:31.170> believe<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.560> outside<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and believe the outside of the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.780 
and believe the outside of the
well<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.570> emergency<00:01:33.960> bunker<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.380> here

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
well the emergency bunker right here

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.320 
well the emergency bunker right here
that<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> side<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.690> building

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
that is on the side of the building

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.750 
that is on the side of the building
there<00:01:39.050> now<00:01:39.770> we'll<00:01:40.040> go<00:01:40.190> over<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:40.700> towards<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
there now we'll go over here towards the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.999 
there now we'll go over here towards the
Oh<00:01:42.990> seeing<00:01:43.990> where<00:01:44.200> they<00:01:44.350> go<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.650> generator

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
Oh seeing where they go to the generator

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.859 
Oh seeing where they go to the generator
my<00:01:47.490> guess<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.850> after<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> Raptor

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
my guess it's after in the Raptor

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.870 
my guess it's after in the Raptor
did<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> little<00:01:50.470> mix-up<00:01:50.829> here<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.490> here's<00:01:51.820> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
did a little mix-up here so here's the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.080 
did a little mix-up here so here's the
Replicators<00:01:52.750> we'll<00:01:52.899> go<00:01:53.020> excite<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.729> where<00:01:54.939> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
Replicators we'll go excite is where the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.530 
Replicators we'll go excite is where the
keep<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> raptors<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> movie

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540

electric fences and all that there's a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.319 
electric fences and all that there's a
little<00:02:00.310> setup

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.480 

and<00:02:04.420> now<00:02:04.899> move<00:02:05.469> over<00:02:05.710> towards<00:02:05.890> where<00:02:06.399> they

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
and now move over towards where they

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.260 
and now move over towards where they
turn<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.789> power<00:02:07.000> back<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.570> generator

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
turn the power back on and generator

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.240 
turn the power back on and generator
even<00:02:08.930> got<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.170> intense<00:02:09.500> chase<00:02:09.800> scene<00:02:10.070> where

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
even got the intense chase scene where

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.910 
even got the intense chase scene where
he's<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.520> goal<00:02:10.760> because<00:02:11.510> HUD<00:02:11.840> still<00:02:12.110> wrapped

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
he's like goal because HUD still wrapped

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.170 
he's like goal because HUD still wrapped
it<00:02:13.070> all<00:02:13.160> there<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.160> new<00:02:16.280> utility<00:02:16.730> share

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.520 

got<00:02:20.629> started<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.409> and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
got started that going and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.890 
got started that going and
all<00:02:24.100> way<00:02:24.250> down<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:25.330> all<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> pipes

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
all way down there with all the pipes

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
all way down there with all the pipes
and<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.319> cancels<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.010> back<00:02:27.190> off<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.970> mask

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.559 

and<00:02:34.790> now<00:02:34.910> we'll<00:02:35.090> continue<00:02:35.120> our<00:02:35.750> exploration

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.650 

I'm<00:02:39.749> the<00:02:40.019> trail

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 

and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.449 
and
so<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.630> decided<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.990> go<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.349> kind<00:02:47.340> of

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
so I decided to go with the kind of

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.059 
so I decided to go with the kind of
cinematic<00:02:48.150> style<00:02:48.450> little<00:02:48.780> coaster<00:02:49.770> ride<00:02:49.950> in
