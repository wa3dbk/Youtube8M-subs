this is a very nice printer we bought
this<00:02:40.300> from<00:02:40.510> Walmart<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.320> was<00:02:41.410> on<00:02:41.530> sale<00:02:41.560> for

this from Walmart and it was on sale for
4995<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.090> big<00:02:46.270> deal<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.840> was

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
4995 I think the big deal is it was

now it's all covered heel that back and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.900 
now it's all covered heel that back and
another<00:03:11.620> reason<00:03:11.799> why<00:03:12.040> we<00:03:12.220> decided<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.730> go<00:03:12.790> with

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
another reason why we decided to go with

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.330 
another reason why we decided to go with
this<00:03:13.209> printer<00:03:13.599> is<00:03:13.840> because<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.290> zipped<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
this printer is because it zipped the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.789 
this printer is because it zipped the
ink<00:03:15.580> cartridges<00:03:16.090> were<00:03:16.269> cheaper<00:03:18.180> because<00:03:19.799> of

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
ink cartridges were cheaper because of

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.410 
ink cartridges were cheaper because of
digging<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.220> find<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.610> printer<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
digging to find a printer but the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420 
digging to find a printer but the
cartridges<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.260> really<00:03:23.530> expensive<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.220> some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
