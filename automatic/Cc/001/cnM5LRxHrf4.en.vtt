 brands and they have their own brand 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 that lumix is ​​therefore a more 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 professional innovator who also has 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.269

 he has no hydrogen peroxide at all 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 this is a natural product for them 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.559
 yellow blonde and white hair and like me

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.200
 15 days to not let him get a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 color unum a very yellow color 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.789
 they sent me to test I go 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.460
 tell you that I thought I 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.100
 I liked it was the result so that the color 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 natural product is the product with no 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 type of dilution is the color it even 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.910
 texture so the conditioner and it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 has a very tasty smell also I 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.920
 I commented that only with the guard in the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.049
 my hand got 6 at 11 but let's go 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 without gloves with nothing also my mother 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.659
 as new it is just wash with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.360
 the right soap that comes out but you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.630
 you can also use with a glove 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.400
 to prevent any blemishes and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 ignites the lumix dictator he is a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 professional product he is well 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 concentrated because it is for the hairdresser 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.009
 professional to work with all 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.369
 the hair tones have to be well 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.799
 concentrated in my hair this time I 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.509
 I already used it pure too, but this time I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.509
 I'd rather use it diluted 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 So I made this mixin 'up here, okay ? 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 I put one part of the lumix and two 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 share a white conditioner that there 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.070
 left over and think that I think the son 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 much but only what I used to baptize 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.649
 My hair was gone from here mixed 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 I would rather dilute because I wanted one 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.020
 so natural effect I too 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.060
 I wanted 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.519
 I 'm sorry but how am I going to say this? 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.959
 very light even because I did not want to 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.080
 get greener hair 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.470
 this time is 24 and likes hair 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.660
 and then just pass it pure and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 leave a minute at the most which is the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.840
 hair looks silver 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.480
 but this time I just wanted to be 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 even yellow and there I preferred to use with 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.000
 white cream I put a part of the two lux 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.400
 parts of crei I spent in washed hair 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.890
 with the sound he leaps my mattress for two 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.140
 Sometimes I've loved your oiliness. 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.239
 then I went through a mix all the hair up 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 split the hair so I half passed in the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.680
 bottom half but I came back spent in 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.829
 other half 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.209
 I left two minutes and rinse 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:55.900
 also in the hair does not get hit or not 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.299
 to be so seated is to disarm 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.160
 same side and thus give to whoever is 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.099
 It is interesting to have a professional 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.019
 product that you can apply has ended 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.480
 to make the lights and can apply 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.389
 washbasin even and depending on the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.700
 hair its use is mixed or does not dare 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.980
 pure the good to use diluted yielding 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.389
 a lot because only a little bit goes 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.239
 to triple 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.400
 so it yields a lot and it does not lose 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.370
 the power to yellow pain because you 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.579
 mixed as it is very limited 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.630
 even diminishing and beautiful Baptist 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.329
 quite so you're going to do the hair 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.120
 platinum so you can use it 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.799
 diluted that will work very well 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.010
 and another thing I found cool is a 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.079
 moisturizing product it does not have ammonia 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.200
 does not have peroxide then 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.810
 tint it will treat the hair is still 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.290
 along came and if this brochure 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.810
 me talking that has argan oil oil 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.359
 of macadamia extract of aloe vera and 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.830
 imported pigments and really my 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.190
 hair is very dry 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.740
 very soft cobain funny even looks 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.840
 the conditioner I used set was 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.330
 a simple conditioner is not it that 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.820
 this result is because I have already used 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.670
 other times he alone and I know that 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.830
 it is very moisturizing even though I 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.230
 I enjoyed talking to the lumix people 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.510
 since they are manufacturers that they 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.480
 make a moisturizing mask without the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.830
 equal pigment is only of its segment only 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.020
 do treatment 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.880
 He talked to me, he already has them. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.210
 have in their line a mask 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.120
 reconstructor that is super reconstructor 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.670
 moisturizing also that the same base of the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.780
 Lumix is matzah only pain that she is of 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.010
 treatment and this body will answer 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.960
 involves and we'll see how it's going to be 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.230
 because if it really is too much 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.440
 moisturizer and there in this leaflet that 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.340
 is to see something that I found very very 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.130
 interesting was the first time 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.410
 received this way is explaining how 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.630
 you use sloppiness in every tone of 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.300
 hair for example're talking about your 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.820
 hair was very light is that blonde 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.090
 very clear that you must pass and 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.460
 leave only 20 seconds of such without 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.430
 he is and helps in the fast in the very hair 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.220
 fast or even very clear you 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.970
 it only leaves 20 seconds you mix 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.490
 with white body and blond hair 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.680
 Of course but not so 8 so you 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.730
 can leave from one minute to five 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.460
 minutes 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.610
 This was the darkest blond hair you 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.440
 You can leave from two to ten minutes and then 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.970
 you see your hair type how is that 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.460
 It looks good, you can even take a 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.540
 I also wank myself as I am already accustomed 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.030
 Already 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.370
 bolzano an egg but can take a test 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.680
 de mecha can see how it is 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.900
 and then one last tip they gave here 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.610
 is that if you make a mistake and leave the 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.849
 hair more gray than you wanted 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.580
 You wash your hair again. 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.979
 the shampoo is it goes that sao paulo is going 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.899
 remove the excess pigment does not have 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.969
 that thing now our chumbou 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:02.490
 took a lifetime to get out not only if she 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.439
 will condition again and ready 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.719
 The excess that you have passed will 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.699
 hair will stay there for only nuanced 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.249
 show you the difference from him pure 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.580
 For him diluted I got an apply yes 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:17.959
 of tic tac and there I applied diluted 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.789
 this lock're applied left the GPO 

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:23.909
 I think only minutes in the second half. 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:27.409
 I rinse and in this mecha I applied it 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.409
 pure're 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.430
 is the side of here with diluted baptizer and 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.820
 this side of here with more gray side 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.430
 It's with a baptized for pure then in a 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.530
 hair in this tone so very difficult 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.690
 someone who stoll hair is more 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.150
 interesting to pass diluted knowing 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.910
 that it will only be silver 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.730
 if you pass it neat it gets 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.830
 slightly gray that I left 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.170
 Just a minute, we'll leave you ten. 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.810
 minutes is the maximum action time one 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.460
 That's fine hair there. 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.780
 I think it must be cool that the 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.840
 men is not the one with the hair 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.370
 grizzly there pass the no leave leave 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.560
 about 10 minutes will be that 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.810
 hair well so invented I never 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.610
 I tested it but I think it will be cool 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.980
 and that was it I wanted to show to boys 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.020
 It is for you to do reviews 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.840
 more humanized than I tested I liked it 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.670
 a lot and I'm going until this month now though 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.350

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.850
 sell to the forgotten end consumer 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.160
