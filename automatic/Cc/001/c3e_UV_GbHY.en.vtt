00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 and now i want to introduce you to rick 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.370
 a little walk on it I will show you 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.859
 things i use when with him 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.960
 I work and tell you about some examples 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.020
 qualities that suit me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.199
 his face shape and expression here we have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.849
 pair of early people sketches for rig 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.060
 I want to pay special attention to 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 balance expression expression here is very 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 simple and practically universal and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.460
 the essence of the variety of forms that we 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.160
 we get round eyebrows and even eyes 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.260
 nose 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.260
 smooth upper lip and rounded lower 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.059
 it is quite specific and tough 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 chin line 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.170
 + hair shape that complements the overall 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 silhouette 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 supports it forms the whole body with this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 character overall tone is very important 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 good looking attractive 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 character and you need to make sure that we 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.119
 We understand how to relate all the details of his 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 looks and so this is ray in the original 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.780
 Riga positions 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.810
 here the general tone is not very noticeable we 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.229
 we miss a little so for example here I 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.970
 slightly changed the original expression 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.369
 created a neutral basis with which 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.420
 i can work it is true over the top 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.130
 changes expression 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 but at least returns a little general tone 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.380
 there is a new direction 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.320
 for example from nose to eyebrows also in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.409
 process involved the nostrils 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 lip line jaw line 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.899
 almost perpendicular to the ears in the ears 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.149
 slight slope 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.820
 so better feel the connection with the jaw and 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.649
 here I slightly modified the area to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.229
 she looked more separate from the area 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 Eyes here I push a little improved 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.310
 general shape of the nose and eyebrows 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.720
 and besides, there is no feeling 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.190
 here and here are round lines 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.970
 created more organically and alive 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 feeling 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.200
 and there is a sense of interaction with 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.510
 eyebrow form the eye is now the top 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.170
 point here and at the eyebrows it is different 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.190
 direction and at the inside of the eye 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.510
 have my own 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.950
 also in the other direction again 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.140
 we all changed very little 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.080
 only to ask more tone by 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.209
 compared to the original expression 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:54.519
 back here see the parallel circle 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:57.400
 no transition from nose to brows nostrils go 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:04.269
 exactly down and the mouth is pretty wide so 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.910
 that there is no feeling that there is a transition and 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.280
 again the ears are perpendicular to the jaw 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.810
 such are the little things that can help 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.030
 slightly improve the design 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.019
 they can be kept in memory in parallel with 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.440
 By posing also note that I am pretty 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.180
 strongly changed the shape of the eyebrows 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.989
 This was done so that I have 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.989
 there are three clear lines here 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:34.840
 serves several tasks at once 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.940
 determines the interaction of muscles by doing 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:45.220
 frontal section here is 1 muscular 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.900
 group and wrinkle the other that's all 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.440
 only gives a little expressiveness 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.810
 Forms here showing that 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.510
 This muscle has a different area of â€‹â€‹action. 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.530
 frontal group 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.329
 what helps to start allocating 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.680
 muscle interaction but more importantly in 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.739
 our mind laid process 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.840
 character recognition 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.000
 take a look at a couple of drawings you can see 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.980
 what is there full of specific forms for 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.870
 eyebrows 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.739
 these three graphic lines are very important 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.470
 when you put a character in a pose because 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.160
 that they very well reflect 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.650
 what does the character feel in our consciousness 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.580
 embedded form recognition process and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.580
 eyebrow characters 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.830
 It is these three lines that we see and interpret. 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.180
 all the emotions that express eyebrows can 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.680
 simplify up to three lines possible when 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.750
 modeling will have to spend 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.320
 more time but exactly that 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.960
 determining factor and it shows on any 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:02.800
 images and beyond expressions 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.050
 our own individuals supporting 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.510
 eyebrow visibility you can show 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.260
 more contrast line not only 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.580
 creates emotions for the character and shows 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.790
 what does the character feel 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.120
 but the contrast between these forms sets 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.230
 total change of emotions and allows us 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.090
 fix the emotion as such 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.669
 this character moves from more 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.520
 neutral and even state more 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.200
 curved rounded shape and us this 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.960
 recorded as significant 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.360
 changing the expression remembering the contrast 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.110
 you can achieve more emotional 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.290
 range 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.010
 without a strong eyebrow movement here 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.380
 and here 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.900
 if to speak distance change 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.690
 insignificant but emotionally they 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.030
 go a long way from neutrality 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.630
 to thoughtfulness or reflection on 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.880
 problem and we immediately notice such 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.530
 changes 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.930
 stronger than changing the pattern itself 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.780
 lines moving your eyebrows from this over 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.280
 neutral position 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.280
 something more pronounced and strong 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.500
 I also pushed them slightly away from 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.020
 neutrality 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.330
 thoughtfulness it can be the reverse 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.330
 side lose from neutral to 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.690
 thinking from there to embarrassment or 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.789
 interest 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:38.080
 it's all very easy shape change 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:42.220
 eyebrows but now we have instead of these three 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.699
 lines something more simple and smooth that 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.409
 shows eyebrow stress relaxation 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.060
 using such a contrast we can 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.300
 register emotional changes 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:58.240
 without much change in shape, you can 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:07.539
 of course and much stronger to change again 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:10.740
 three lines and something more contrast 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.740
 rounded and curved
