00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello nobility, alright then 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 Let's go to another video of the tavern. 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.180
 virtual portray again today about 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 medical the gathering now make a 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.560
 card verification 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 so let's start with a very 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.120
 used in ancient times that would be 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.829
 ghost in the county 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 this letter a yes is a letter to the mother is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.590
 very interesting it has a good cost 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.710
 down on a good attack so let's go 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 for your initial data on it in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.010
 South is a scope there in the topic ne 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 you will find the name of the letter 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.270
 ghost in the county and next to her 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.339
 of whether the course demands attributed that it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.070
 has 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.830
 How much would it cost her for four years? 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.830
 to use two white ones that would be 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.770
 plain and two black ones that plant 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.729
 So we have the cost 4 to be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 used practice very simple play is 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.820
 a low cost for a letter a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.299
 interesting in the middle of it in the middle you 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 will identify soon after the image is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.100
 the type of creature 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 in case here there is a creature is 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.600
 Legendary is a legendary creature that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 are legendary creatures that can only 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.079
 have one on the field if you play two 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 two are destroyed be removed from 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.320
 game and also has a side-type of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 creature will have if it is what it is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.990
 spirit is goblin is elf so much 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.450
 important this information because it has 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 specific decks only for this type 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 creature that where for example you 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.620
 has a bar of weak all practical 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 have your skills 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 a power to go to all at the same time 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.209
 So you play weak on everyone in my 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 same ability power as another 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.220
 weaknesses make available then this is it has 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.530
 than to be well served when making a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.580
 sound a deck with a single type of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.040
 creature 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.980
 right after the type of creature has 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.860
 the edition has basic editions that neither 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.510
 them is the 7th 8th 9th now everything m12m 13 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.360
 annual directions that would be this edition 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.640
 and also the other editions that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.680
 It is known that neither puts example 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:58.530
 abinee rabbinical carretoni is going to have 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.209
 also as dax uncle comes in several 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.909
 editions to date have been 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.040
 and there the symbol also 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:10.379
 demonstrates other important information 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:14.609
 that it would be if it in common common is rare 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.060
 mystic then common is black in common is 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.450
 only a bright little sign like this is rare 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.180
 already yellow and mystical is totally 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.230
 different from all 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.299
 below the idea of this medium goes 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.069
 demonstrate ability of the creature or 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.799
 civil society will also demonstrate if its 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.760
 whether or not she has a 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.250
 story in the car in edit context 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.099
 always every issue next it brings a 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.560
 story is specific to the issue that neither 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.919
 for example rabbinic from that time all 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.849
 those and those constructions and air between 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.470
 others 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:01.230
 and beneath his ability and his 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.480
 story that if in that text on the page 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.139
 in this main framework 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.010
 I come who designed your left 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:14.250
 and if it is a creature comes the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.359
 power and the defense that would be 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.829
 attack and its resistance on the right side 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.570
 without paying much attention to these 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:27.510
 details why creature power at 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.770
 times when it is low cost is well 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.680
 interesting and to finish behind the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.430
 card they are all the same 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.730
 I will demonstrate in a silva is in your 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.210
 superior in his caput ghetto doctor 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.460
 below will have the five types of 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.150
 land that has always been used 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.890
 plain forest mountain marsh and is 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.110
 island and more to show deco master is 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.510
 very interesting, everyone is equal behind 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.210
 It's difficult, we'll go 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:09.630
 identifies a face of this false not by 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.430
 today, this presentation would be 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.020
 of the same card 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.240
