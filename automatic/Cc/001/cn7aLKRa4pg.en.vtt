00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
think so i went on the easy mode just to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.800 
think so i went on the easy mode just to
test<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.150> go<00:03:29.780> through<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:35.630> yeah

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810
