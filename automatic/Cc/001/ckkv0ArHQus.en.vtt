 day where it is happening this week 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 and you know the standard version of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 the console will ship that 8 giga the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 internal storage with the system that in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 already occupies half what is it going to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 pass for games purchased in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 download the worry goes up because in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.700
 effect of many titles requires 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 several gigas of disk space this 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 weekend the neogaf forum has released the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 list of games that will be as well 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 available on the nintendo eshop 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.620
 among them some will not even be able to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 to be installed on the wiiu in his 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 8 gigabyte version without memory expansion 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 this is the case of rabbits rabbits landes

 fifa 13 jean bouilhou a ninja gaiden 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 iii for his very greedy titles which 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.690
 exceeds 4 gigabytes of space 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 necessary it will therefore be necessary to go through 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.840
 versions 10 or predict squarely 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 neighborhood the premium version of the wiiu 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 which counts l 32 gigabytes of storage a 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.930
 info that will be very useful for those who 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.760
 are planning to buy the console the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 physical media distribution in 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.260
 further from being dead at least on the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.729
 wiiu on November 30, the wii or 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 will go out and with what language of the most 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 big blockbusters this end of the year 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 call of duty black ops 2 will be part of the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 line up and it has been analyzed under all 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.119
 seams by digital foundry 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 American hardware specialist 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.090
 their report is final if the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 visual quality of the wii version or of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 black ops 's is equivalent to that of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 the xbox 360 version and bond higher than 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.040
 the ps3 version nothing goes to the level 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 framerate indeed on the wii to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.460
 blackhawks 2 does not exceed 30 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.600
 frames per second which causes some 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.829
 annoying slowdowns and leaves 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 finally this version 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.420
 far behind the version of the 360 ​​and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.799
 his 60 frames per second in question the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 processor may not be fast enough 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.340
 but especially the platform brio any 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.450
 new is that developers do not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.509
 probably not yet very 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.509
 well 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.229
 while everyone has their eyes 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.729
 pointed at the wiiu that comes out this 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 nintendo week would have new 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.280
 projects for his other home console 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.320
 the wii 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.820
 the info is surprising and could not 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.220
 to be a rumor but the site 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.990
 nintendoworldreport announces that nintendo 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.090
 was pulling out a mini version of the wii 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.890
 this one would already be even programmed for 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.790
 be available at resellers from 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.200
 December 7th 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.550
 if the info is true we can imagine 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.230
 that she would be especially much less 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.000
 expensive to fill those who have 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.680
 not the means to afford the wiiu 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.819
 outside of this specific case we do not see too much 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.830
 the interest of a new version of the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.570
 console all the more so for all those 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 who buy the wiiu this one will be 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.019
 backward compatible the second-hand market 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.910
 should therefore run at full speed 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.950
 for the wii we will not need a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.489
 confirmation or denial on the part of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.110
 nintendo 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.060
 we will know more soon 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.769
 case to follow the adedy of the day and for 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.959
 captain cucumbers who in the frame 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.580
 a homework assignment organizes a survey 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.739
 on some hurry of fast food 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.239
 you surely know if you are from 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.680
 like to give your opinion when we give it to you 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.750
 demand went well through the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.920
 25 waiting for you the click is over 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 for today very soon
