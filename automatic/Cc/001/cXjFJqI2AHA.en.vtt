this so that's all you do

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.670 
this so that's all you do
it's<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.469> you're<00:02:13.890> bringing<00:02:14.609> a<00:02:15.200> loop<00:02:16.200> through

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's like you're bringing a loop through

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's like you're bringing a loop through
a<00:02:16.709> loop<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.170> hold<00:02:19.499> this<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.950> up

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
a loop and so then I hold this one up

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.000 
a loop and so then I hold this one up
and<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.480> bring<00:02:21.749> that<00:02:21.989> through<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:24.620> actually<00:02:25.620> find

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and I bring that through I actually find

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.410 
and I bring that through I actually find
these<00:02:26.249> super<00:02:26.579> easy<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.939> do<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.269> you're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
these super easy to do when you're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
these super easy to do when you're
standing<00:02:27.659> up<00:02:27.989> because<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.670> flow

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
standing up because all of this can flow

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.280 
standing up because all of this can flow
to<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.389> ground<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:31.609> then<00:02:32.609> so<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.389> just<00:02:33.719> once

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to the ground and then so you just once

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.490 
to the ground and then so you just once
you<00:02:34.409> get<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> hang<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.629> just<00:02:36.930> I'm

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you get the hang of it so I'm just I'm

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.089 
you get the hang of it so I'm just I'm
holding<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.250> down<00:02:38.519> here<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.239> loot<00:02:39.780> I'm

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
holding this down here I'm loot I'm

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.229 
holding this down here I'm loot I'm
stretching<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.639> so<00:02:41.909> it's<00:02:42.060> big<00:02:42.209> enough

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
stretching this out so it's big enough

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.199 
stretching this out so it's big enough
for<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.810> fingers<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.260> grab<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.980> yarn<00:02:44.219> like

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
for my fingers to grab the yarn like

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.129 
for my fingers to grab the yarn like
