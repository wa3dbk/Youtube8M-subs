00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.710
 as I explain on my website 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.130
 when I choose them and voice 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 future bridge 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.500
 and to make sure that the type of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.189
 support with which you go 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.029
 work whose valves with parade 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.760
 complete and a microphone here that prevents the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.460
 valve to get inside the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.190
 leg or if you work with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.770
 supports and spin me off with a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.300
 rubber end as well there 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.190
 have an erotic fact that suspect of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.820
 showa that come inside the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.660
 leg when you go get yourself 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.980
 your breton but we can offer you 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.690
 the famous brampton support and fall hpa 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.640
 which is a pump in my opinion of pumps 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.740
 points 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 why wedge and well it's simple 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.640
 when you go to buy your premium 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.180
 tons of origin it comes with tires 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.189
 brenton var and then this magnitude after 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.509
 it is very difficult to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.490
 climb above 50 psi and the tires 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.869
 of origin which must rise much more 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.310
 higher than 50 pieces then thereby the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 charm of a conclusion that it's 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.539
 really a different point pump 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.229
 defect of this club pump you have a 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.929
 beak here unthreaded which means that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.909
 if you work with this vine 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.159
 full hair necessarily when 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.200
 you're coming for tight hands the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.869
 gorgeous hitting inside the money 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 and then she does not attend able 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 to come inflate the tires so had 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.149
 if you absolutely want bays this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 pump type the avoid any problems I 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.639
 recommends you have nets 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.429
 complete for insertion and well that's 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.350
 simple we come here m vis-à-vis we push 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.069
 mechanically so once one exercises 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.009
 a force 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.050
 and then we come back up the lever for 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.360
 block 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.770
 now we can see that all 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.319
 regions 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.530
 so to reinflate me necessarily 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.620
 to see come settle down solidly 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.120
 after 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.489
 the rays to come inflate because 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.860
 it really takes to avoid moving in 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.989
 left or right because is worth what 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.180
 risk of damaging to damage the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.049
 superb game have also joined the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.810
 lower leg 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.940
 so you really have to avoid moving his 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.500
 hands the faults of this pump the water 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.780
 in addition that she is not able to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.780
 inflate the pressure to the maximum 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.370
 this is for the Breton spa zéfal
