to<00:00:12.670> begin<00:00:12.969> this<00:00:13.120> design<00:00:13.599> drawing<00:00:14.110> in<00:00:14.379> shape

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
to begin this design drawing in shape

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.139 

then<00:00:29.410> using<00:00:29.770> black<00:00:30.040> paint<00:00:30.399> outline<00:00:31.029> the
