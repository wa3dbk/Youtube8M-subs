00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.960
 hey hi hi everyone 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.120
 it's served me yes yes it's ok 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.519
 explodes 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.919
 to tell you that tomorrow tomorrow Saturday 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 18 hours I learned so after me there 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.560
 there was no league of legends so 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 Normally we had to do some great 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.499
 mario world 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.769
 we had to do I 'm going to comment on the 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.929
 super mario world's performance of james 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.329
 but since we have the time we have time 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.699
 to have the time but exceptionally 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.940
 we will do something different 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.309
 and I'm going to say speed run and in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 live a rpg game we have time she 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 rpg take a little time even 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.149
 so good the speed run rpg all amv 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.089
 bastard yes good okay 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.089
 so I had done ff6 at the time on a 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.980
 other site an aspect and age but that's 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.929
 why not do final fantasy iv which 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.249
 is a nice speedrun plus you have to 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.769
 that I make a time on what 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.960
 make backups take it safe and 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.579
 it should take about four hours 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 final fantasy iv on super nintendo whose 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.080
 finally 6-2 in American obviously 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.370
 the final fantasy on america that had 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.940
 a weird notation before final fantasy 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.700
 7 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.490
 obviously who put everyone back on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.580
 the right way of the final fantasy at 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 level of the timeline we will say ea 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 and so here we are going to get this done 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 very friendly live controller in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 hand and not 500 hands of course I 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.990
 you will explain everything we can there 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 do like bilic absolutely delusional in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.270
 knowing that this is the game is difficult 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.310
 by these bosses battles all the fights 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.450
 against the bosses are pretty hard but 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.060
 it's a pretty simple road to learn 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 so eventually that's okay 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.870
 you motivate yourself if you want to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.700
 launch in this category finally this 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.610
 weird discipline that is the speed run 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.040
 of rpg so here is so 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.360
 should arrive tomorrow Saturday so I 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.500
 look at my calendar 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.320
 a Saturday, March 9 is obviously 18 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.560
 hours we will have fun 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.270
 we're going to move, it's the burst it's 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.830
 the party of the slip so that's final fantasy 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.640
 soft square of love I tell you I 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.650
