like so I'm going to zoom in a little

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:03.690 
like so I'm going to zoom in a little
bit<00:01:52.650> as<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.550> closer

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.830 

there<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.850> go<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.150> we're<00:02:05.300> kind<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.540> getting<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
there we go so we're kind of getting the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.350 
there we go so we're kind of getting the
basic<00:02:06.230> shape<00:02:06.260> here<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:08.000> we're<00:02:08.210> going<00:02:08.300> to

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
basic shape here then we're going to

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.960 
basic shape here then we're going to
take<00:02:08.540> four<00:02:09.410> which<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.860> kind<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.430> darker

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
take four which is kind of a darker

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.080 
take four which is kind of a darker
brown<00:02:11.330> matte<00:02:11.720> shade<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.760> we're<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.910> going

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
brown matte shade and we're just going

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.880 
brown matte shade and we're just going
to<00:02:14.150> start<00:02:14.480> playing<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:15.020> over<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> top<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
to start playing that over the top of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.530 
to start playing that over the top of
that<00:02:16.100> brown<00:02:20.410> making<00:02:21.410> sure<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.450> blended

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
that brown making sure that is blended

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:36.410 
that brown making sure that is blended
well

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.570 

so<00:02:36.990> it's<00:02:37.170> looking<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> weird<00:02:38.370> shape

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
so it's looking a bit like a weird shape

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.339 
so it's looking a bit like a weird shape
at<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.849> moment<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:39.870> fear<00:02:40.110> because

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
at the moment but do not fear because

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.960 
at the moment but do not fear because
once<00:02:40.560> you've<00:02:40.709> got<00:02:40.890> eyeliner<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.610> will<00:02:41.760> be

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
once you've got eyeliner on it will be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:53.930 
once you've got eyeliner on it will be
perfect

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.830 

so<00:02:54.600> next<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.200> line<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.740> massive<00:02:56.400> part<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.970> 60s

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
so next I line is a massive part of 60s

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.130 
so next I line is a massive part of 60s
