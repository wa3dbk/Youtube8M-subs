00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.750
 Winter in the Sauerland ten degrees the sun 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 laughs welcome 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.390
 a new episode of the Sauerland 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 barbecue we do two things today 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.150
 We shriek for two reasons because we 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 two different spice mixes for it 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.450
 to take 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 this is not only great as an appetizer 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.200
 but also to lose weight or for the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.040
 marco from honest food 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.899
 or lose weight ideal for him 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 eat ap what is he doing now i 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.619
 well , both do not care 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.060
 We will bring you to the table 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.770
 then you can look over it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.940
 make and then we hope that's there 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.500
 somehow a little something to learn 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.800
 and take along can have fun with the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 new episode here they are now the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.610
 stars of our appetizer respectively 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.320
 our main course if you because 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 wants to take the rest when it as 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 Main course is enough to calculate 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.619
 two and a half to three of these black 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.250
 tiger prawns or shrimps per 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.140
 person 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.899
 if you give it as a starter we are enough 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 today with a slight glaze and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.550
 a salad or with a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.069
 bitu baguette then reaches one per 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.810
 person or maybe just one 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.590
 Half is only one after all 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 starter 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.429
 I'll turn around right now 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.739
 take care of the glaze 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.450
 if they are here just a quick grin 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.080
 from both sides then in the middle 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.729
 divided 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.690
 then each glaze on the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.920
 private or shrimp 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.599
 applied and then they will again 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.180
 just elected and then they come on 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.040
 look down you go very fast is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 just annoying if you like that 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.120
 Do not do it all right then 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.330
 then a lot of money for nothing 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330
 output 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.209
 First we need the juice of two 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.000
 Incidentally, limes lime because 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.010
 which have a fine acidity like lemons 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.629
 and that fits in my opinion 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.079
 better with seafood like these 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.030
 then add the acid to the lemons 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.739
 we need a bit of pepper and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 salt 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:52.450
 You see, you do not need a lot of work 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.189
 that these cut these seafood 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.530
 because the flesh in itself already has one 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:01.139
 so good taste that I reluctant 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.940
 would cover up with too many spices 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.799
 then we'll cut our bread 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.900
 because it's all ratzfatz 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.670
 that can be where I really nice and thick 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.290
 cut it up just a little 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.120
 herb butter on it then come the short 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.129
 on the grill and are only to 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.720
 We have served here today 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.359
 For once, maybe it's shaaf 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.849
 bread decided that there is in 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.739
 known larger ones 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.000
 grocery stores it's with chili 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.450
 I can only taste good 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.939
 recommend 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.319
 that wants to be cut open and then 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.579
 come a bit of herbal butter 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.079
 then the come then if 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.879
 the shrimp for the second time on the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.599
 Grill come with us 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.599
 achieved 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 our daniel were now very short on 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.300
 the grill have become slightly red like 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.830
 you see and we will be in the now 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.280
 they are not yet through 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.770
 cooked 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 this only serves to make the cup 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.090
 easier to open or crack 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.739
 lets because we want the animals more 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.049
 or less completely in today 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.850
 cut the middle and become for it 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.890
 I share you now and then with the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.230
 sprinkle glaze or our spices 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.190
 and then they come again on 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.330
 the grill to then really pull 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.670
 we shared our chains now 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.780
 you can either use the heads as decoration 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.230
 to do with it 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.790
 he wants gold or just throw it away 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.260
 there are people who are still packing 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.480
 with on the grill and suck the later 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.560
 from who wants that can do that I do 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.270
 Not 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.980
 So we have to save ourselves in the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.780
 shared middle and now where I still have you 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.060
 close up so he can watch 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.880
 what's next here so now 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.770
 the split shrimp and how you see 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.240
 can be found up here the intestine and the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.870
 of course, no one wants that 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.210
 with food 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.710
 that's why we take it out now 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.840
 is quite simply the best one takes 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.160
 tweezers or something similar packs up 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.600
 turn it on and just pull it down like that 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.400
 See that can be solved easily 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.400
 But nobody wants to know the ladies 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.000
 yes now we come to ours 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.530
 klausur or the spice that 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.570
 does not have to be much, so we just have 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.010
 the limes and salt and pepper here 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.720
 to a small marinade 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.160
 stirred together and now only very 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.260
 just over it 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.260
 that really does not have to be much 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:43.370
 about all four so very little and 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.520
 now have two kinds of spices once 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.490
 I have a barbecue off here or 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.560
 the raw portuguese from the company cent 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:58.330
 fewer 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:04.180
 very light over it and then humanitas 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.180
 That's lemon with dried tomatoes 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.160
 cumin that was it you see 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.030
 just a little bit now 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.560
 back to the grill 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.950
 the same is done as you can 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.950
 already eat 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.850
 that was simply our shrimp are 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.350

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.920

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.890
 after grill 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.260
 We would be happy about a thumb 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.120
