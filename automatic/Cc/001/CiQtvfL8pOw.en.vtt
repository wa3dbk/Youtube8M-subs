00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
grow towards and so instead of bringing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
grow towards and so instead of bringing
the<00:01:32.850> kitchen<00:01:33.119> sink<00:01:33.360> forward<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.840> focused

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the kitchen sink forward we focused

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
the kitchen sink forward we focused
purely<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> next<00:01:34.829> generation<00:01:35.009> services<00:01:35.689> for

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
purely on next generation services for

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
purely on next generation services for
us<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> things<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:37.740> important<00:01:38.189> are<00:01:38.310> how

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
us the things that are important are how

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
us the things that are important are how
long<00:01:38.790> does<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> customer<00:01:39.540> interaction<00:01:40.259> take

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
long does the customer interaction take

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
long does the customer interaction take
how<00:01:41.460> long<00:01:41.670> does<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.180> service<00:01:42.689> take<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.320> get

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
how long does the service take to get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
how long does the service take to get
set<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.799> after<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.369> customers<00:01:44.759> requested<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
set up after the customers requested it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
set up after the customers requested it
so<00:01:45.600> there's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> lot<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.290> end<00:01:46.320> logging

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so there's a lot of back end logging

leadership<00:02:00.619> from<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> next-gen<00:02:02.790> approach

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
leadership from from a next-gen approach

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.149 
leadership from from a next-gen approach
we<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> answers<00:02:04.799> ourselves

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
we don't have all the answers ourselves

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.310 
we don't have all the answers ourselves
and<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.700> never<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.149> claim<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and we never will claim to have that and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
and we never will claim to have that and
so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> best<00:02:08.879> products<00:02:09.360> come

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so I think that the best products come

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
so I think that the best products come
