back<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.380> again<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.799> think<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.280> four<00:02:01.549> or<00:02:01.670> five

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
back on again I think in four or five

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.149 
back on again I think in four or five
years<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:02.210> lot<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.780> change<00:02:03.259> has<00:02:03.409> happened<00:02:03.590> five
