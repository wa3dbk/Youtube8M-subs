00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so this is what I was trying to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.680 
okay so this is what I was trying to
accomplish<00:00:03.710> last<00:00:04.710> night<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.509> came<00:00:06.509> together

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
accomplish last night and came together

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.980 
accomplish last night and came together
actually<00:00:07.280> pretty<00:00:08.280> well<00:00:08.580> today<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:09.870> thing

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
actually pretty well today the one thing

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.110 
actually pretty well today the one thing
that<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.200> did<00:00:10.290> forget<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.160> bring<00:00:11.429> or<00:00:11.730> didn't

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that I did forget to bring or didn't

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.470 
that I did forget to bring or didn't
even<00:00:12.240> think<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.509> bringing<00:00:13.040> which<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.480> used

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
even think about bringing which I used

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.750 
even think about bringing which I used
when<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.529> was<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> boundary<00:00:17.100> waters<00:00:17.130> with

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
when I was in the boundary waters with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.460 
when I was in the boundary waters with
some<00:00:17.910> clothes<00:00:18.300> pens<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.900> clothespins<00:00:19.080> work

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
some clothes pens and clothespins work

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.060 
some clothes pens and clothespins work
excellent<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.820> secure<00:00:21.300> mosquito<00:00:21.960> netting<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
excellent to secure mosquito netting to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.740 
excellent to secure mosquito netting to
to<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.880> anything<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to just about anything that you need to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.120 
to just about anything that you need to
secure<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.500> right<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.980> actually

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
secure it to so right now it's actually

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.759 
secure it to so right now it's actually
just<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> draped<00:00:27.000> over<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> uh

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
just kind of draped over and it's uh

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
just kind of draped over and it's uh
it's<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:29.939> connected<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> ends<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's not really connected on the ends I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560 
it's not really connected on the ends I
don't<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> tie<00:00:32.279> tonight<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:33.239> because

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
don't want to tie tonight not because

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.620 
don't want to tie tonight not because
it's<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.079> delicate<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> did<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.760> some

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's kind of delicate if I did have some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's kind of delicate if I did have some
clothes<00:00:37.140> pins<00:00:37.469> I'd<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:40.129> put<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> couple<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
clothes pins I'd put put a couple of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.869 
clothes pins I'd put put a couple of
them<00:00:42.559> right<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
them right there as you can see it's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.600 
them right there as you can see it's
just<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> bunched<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.550> my

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
just kind of bunched up on my on my

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.750 
just kind of bunched up on my on my
knots<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.949> bunched<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
knots here and it's bunched up on this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.650 
knots here and it's bunched up on this
side<00:00:54.030> too<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.550> meant<00:00:57.270> for

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
side too it's not it's not meant for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.010 
side too it's not it's not meant for
draping<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.859> hammock<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.510> basically

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
draping over a hammock so I basically

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
draping over a hammock so I basically
just<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.149> weight<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
just have it over and then the weight of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.980 
just have it over and then the weight of
it<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:05.220> pressed<00:01:05.580> against<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> get

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it is pressed against if you want to get

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.340 
it is pressed against if you want to get
in<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.250> raise<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.600> lower<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
in you can just raise it and lower it so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.550 
in you can just raise it and lower it so
certainly<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.100> foolproof<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
certainly not foolproof but I think it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
certainly not foolproof but I think it
should<00:01:13.680> work<00:01:13.740> pretty<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.030> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
should work pretty well and just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.070 
should work pretty well and just
happened<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.390> logo<00:01:18.390> ended<00:01:18.960> up

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
happened to be that the logo ended up

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.420 
happened to be that the logo ended up
facing<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.250> wasn't

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
facing the right way that wasn't

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
facing the right way that wasn't
actually<00:01:20.850> intentional<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.259> looks<00:01:22.530> like

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually intentional but it looks like

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.210 
actually intentional but it looks like
looks<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.729> did<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.939> purpose<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:25.220> rope

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
looks like I did on purpose the rope

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.960 
looks like I did on purpose the rope
line<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.780> i<00:01:27.900> made<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.140> between<00:01:28.680> i<00:01:28.979> purposely

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
line that i made in between i purposely

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 
line that i made in between i purposely
have<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.540> taught<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.799> i<00:01:32.250> mentioned<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.150> my

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
have that taught as i mentioned in my

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.780 
have that taught as i mentioned in my
earlier<00:01:33.540> video<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.130> reason<00:01:35.400> why<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> did<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
earlier video the reason why I did that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.410 
earlier video the reason why I did that
is<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> utilize<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.759> mosquito

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
is so you can utilize the mosquito

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.730 
is so you can utilize the mosquito
netting<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> tarp<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:43.649> be

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
netting or you can use a tarp to be

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
netting or you can use a tarp to be
honest<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> had<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> play<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
honest with you I had to play with it a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
honest with you I had to play with it a
couple<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.750> times<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> mentioned

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
couple of times and I think I mentioned

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
couple of times and I think I mentioned
earlier<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.750> expert<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.740> tired

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
earlier then I'm not an expert not tired

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
earlier then I'm not an expert not tired
so<00:01:50.340> i<00:01:50.399> play<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> couple<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> times

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so i play with it a couple of times

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.319 
so i play with it a couple of times
until<00:01:51.750> i<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.560> had<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.159> set<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
until i actually had it set up so that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
until i actually had it set up so that
when<00:01:54.570> i<00:01:54.600> pulled<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.790> rope<00:01:58.310> from<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.969> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
when i pulled on the rope from from this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.200 
when i pulled on the rope from from this
side<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.930> was<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.409> still<00:02:02.060> making<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
side it was actually still making this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.450 
side it was actually still making this
row<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> taught<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.140> way<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.040> had<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
row of taught the way that i had it at

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.850 
row of taught the way that i had it at
first<00:02:05.719> was<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.140> rope<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.590> actually

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
first was this rope was actually

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
first was this rope was actually
independent<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:09.080> these<00:02:10.080> two<00:02:10.470> end<00:02:10.830> pieces

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
independent of these two end pieces

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.440 
independent of these two end pieces
if<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.170> makes<00:02:13.380> any<00:02:13.500> sense<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.060> wait<00:02:15.270> was

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
if that makes any sense the the wait was

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.780 
if that makes any sense the the wait was
actually<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.900> being<00:02:16.020> held<00:02:16.410> directly<00:02:17.070> by<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
actually just being held directly by the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.840 
actually just being held directly by the
two<00:02:18.210> end<00:02:18.420> pieces<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.380> now<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.100> rope<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.610> not

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
two end pieces and now this rope is not

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.800 
two end pieces and now this rope is not
not<00:02:21.690> independent<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.240> all<00:02:24.390> we<00:02:24.450> have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
not independent so so that's all we have

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.160 
not independent so so that's all we have
it<00:02:24.960> set<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.850> yeah<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.240> i've<00:02:27.510> yet<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
it set up and yeah I like it i've yet to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.460 
it set up and yeah I like it i've yet to
actually<00:02:28.580> try<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.180> try<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.780> much

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually try it out I try it out much

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.820 
actually try it out I try it out much
more<00:02:31.940> poor<00:02:32.940> version<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.690> last<00:02:34.050> evening<00:02:34.380> and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
it we got a little hot because the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.810 
it we got a little hot because the
mosquito<00:02:36.930> net<00:02:37.140> nanny<00:02:37.710> was<00:02:37.920> sitting<00:02:38.250> quite<00:02:38.640> low
