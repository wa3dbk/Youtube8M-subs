00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.360
 first part we will understand how 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.520
 works 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.520
 what is the flute for it 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:17.600
 we have this that we have seen in a 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.250
 previous video in which we observe that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.930
 a series of holes on the part 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.290
 top and a hole in the part 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.090
 lower these holes are those that 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.470
 they produce the sound 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.860
 depending on the position that we place 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.010
 the fingers sound occurs in the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.340
 main hole that would be this for 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.370
 where the air comes out and depending on the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.930
 holes that we have covered produces 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 one note or another as we have commented that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.900
 the flute is in endo that wants 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.880
 say that all your holes plugged 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:02.700
 produce the finger note 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:06.120
 the note of two would be button that hole 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.120
 bottom capped 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 all the holes plugged and blow by 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 the mouthpiece 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.980
 this is the note of two for one for one 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.910
 sweet frank 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.850
 and what we are going to learn in these is 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.770
 series of videos is how to use the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 flute to get 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 learn to play a song 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 with the bagpipe the bagpipe that we are going to 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.710
 learn to manage now that we're going to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 learning to play has its pointer in two 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.550
 whereby that means that everything 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550
 that we can 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.369
 create with this flute what can we 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.369
 play with it with the pointer
