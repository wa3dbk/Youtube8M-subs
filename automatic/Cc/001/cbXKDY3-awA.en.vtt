00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello everyone from Germany, I'm glad 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.420
 greet you in your kitchen and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.880
 today i will make a bear cub with me 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:22.610
 there is such a pier 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 I took the white sugar mass 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:32.360
 colored and brown so i have 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:36.300
 gel paint or pastor paste 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.760
 dyed the sugar mass and now we will 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.910
 do we take cooking oil and need 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.929
 to miss the mark 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.929
 all where you can climb 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:53.879
 everywhere-everywhere-everywhere witta and so but to 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:57.899
 He was not there in pieces but in general everything 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.120
 smeared well to make it so that later 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.409
 all good came from here 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.819
 lagged behind 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.329
 all and now we take the sugar mass of the hand 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:17.319
 also so that they are greased so that you 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.609
 it is a little greased and try 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:31.390
 again in small pieces 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's all good, well, it's not stuck in there 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:45.569
 you need to immediately push a big piece you need 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.569
 little by little all this enough and now 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:02:01.700
 so pretty good there for all 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:08.740
 who you were filled and now this 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.740
 bear cub we send to the fridge 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:21.860
 the freezer has everything for minutes 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:26.090
 I lay down in my freezer now we will 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:33.160
 first try to get a little bit 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 need to do so that we will depart now 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:42.350
 squeeze naturally if it is inside 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.100
 soft then you need to leave us still 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.870
 a little bit to make it freeze 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:53.829
 otherwise when he'll pull him out 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:03:00.410
 agrees so that's it 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:04.579
 bear turned out you can paint him 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:08.269
 black nose and paint his eyes but 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:16.250
 I will do this then now I will plant it and 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:19.359
 let him sit with me and him first 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.799
 necessary to place because it was cold and 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:26.540
 then he needs to be allowed to dry and here 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.019
 such a teddy bear and then we told him 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:34.660
 paint your eyes and nose and you can 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:39.690
 here are the legs too paint 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:44.680

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.430

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:01.590
 using this food marker i 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.280
 I will ask the noses to paint the legs and everything is very 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.280
 easy and simple 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:20.310
 here is one spoon painted and now 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:25.110

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:32.880
 on the sugar mass here I have all the colors 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:39.360
 there's even a gold and a spout 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:45.750
 too hard and so will be enough here 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.870
