yeah monday nine months ago or so I got
called<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.640> see<00:01:03.879> him<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:05.050> always<00:01:05.979> a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
called to see him and it's always a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.880 
called to see him and it's always a
disheartening<00:01:06.580> event<00:01:07.240> because<00:01:07.660> I'd<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:08.650> to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
disheartening event because I'd like to

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.660 
disheartening event because I'd like to
think<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.160> people<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.580> medical

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
think that people in the medical

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.460 
think that people in the medical
profession<00:01:09.940> are<00:01:10.450> spared<00:01:10.840> from<00:01:10.960> some<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.380> these

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
profession are spared from some of these

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.170 
profession are spared from some of these
things<00:01:11.710> sometimes<00:01:12.190> but<00:01:12.460> it's<00:01:12.580> just<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.820> calling

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
things sometimes but it's just a calling

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.609 
things sometimes but it's just a calling
that<00:01:13.210> none<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.570> us<00:01:13.720> were<00:01:13.869> spared<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.229> anything

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
that none of us were spared of anything

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.530 
that none of us were spared of anything
and<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:16.000> met<00:01:16.270> PJ<00:01:16.690> certainly<00:01:17.560> his<00:01:17.680> ages<00:01:18.540> often

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
and so I met PJ certainly his ages often

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.609 
and so I met PJ certainly his ages often
harder<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.869> deal<00:01:20.020> with<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.410> patient

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
harder to deal with in this patient

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.230 
harder to deal with in this patient
population<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.550> I<00:01:21.610> could<00:01:21.759> say<00:01:21.910> since<00:01:22.119> I've

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
population and I could say since I've

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.700 
population and I could say since I've
had<00:01:22.360> kids<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.869> can<00:01:23.050> only<00:01:23.200> imagine<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:23.680> his

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
had kids I can only imagine what his

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.380 
had kids I can only imagine what his
parents<00:01:23.950> were<00:01:24.250> going<00:01:24.670> through<00:01:24.820> at<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.060> point

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
parents were going through at that point

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.889 
parents were going through at that point
in<00:01:25.479> time<00:01:26.100> we've<00:01:27.100> met<00:01:27.130> we've<00:01:27.759> since<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.330> kind<00:01:28.810> of

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
in time we've met we've since I kind of

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.590 
in time we've met we've since I kind of
think<00:01:29.200> solidified<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.220> stronger<00:01:30.790> bond<00:01:31.210> over

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
think solidified a stronger bond over

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.290 
think solidified a stronger bond over
the<00:01:31.690> months<00:01:32.020> mm-hmm<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.700> been<00:01:33.880> very

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
the months mm-hmm and it's been very

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300 
the months mm-hmm and it's been very
rewarding<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:35.800> know<00:01:35.890> I've<00:01:36.009> learned<00:01:36.220> a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
rewarding and you know I've learned a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.219 
rewarding and you know I've learned a
lot<00:01:36.340> from<00:01:36.490> pj<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:37.180> i<00:01:37.630> do<00:01:37.690> with<00:01:37.869> other<00:01:38.020> patients

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
this diagnosis I know what the odds are

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.690

my life and i'm going to go do research

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.990 
my life and i'm going to go do research

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
and try to find a cure that's going to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.880 
and try to find a cure that's going to
better<00:01:49.330> myself<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.930> better<00:01:50.170> others<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
better myself and better others and so

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.380 
better myself and better others and so
that's<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.190> very<00:01:51.220> altruistic<00:01:51.880> kind<00:01:52.299> of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
that's a very altruistic kind of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.149 
that's a very altruistic kind of
behavior<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.720> think<00:01:53.049> yeah<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.500> really<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
behavior I think yeah it really is but I

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.280 
behavior I think yeah it really is but I
think<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.760> takes<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.180> know<00:01:55.299> one<00:01:55.450> dr.<00:01:56.140> razor

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
think it takes one to know one dr. razor

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.649 
think it takes one to know one dr. razor
having<00:01:56.680> spent<00:01:56.950> time<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.729> been<00:01:58.510> by

irrelevant<00:03:42.410> they<00:03:43.010> don't<00:03:43.220> tell<00:03:43.790> me<00:03:43.910> how<00:03:44.060> any

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
irrelevant they don't tell me how any

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.360 
irrelevant they don't tell me how any
one<00:03:44.599> individual<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.440> going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:45.859> over<00:03:46.220> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
one individual is going to do over the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.610 
one individual is going to do over the
course<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.790> time<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:47.389> even<00:03:48.319> though<00:03:48.440> under

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
course of time and so even though under

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.689 
course of time and so even though under
a<00:03:48.650> microscope<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:49.489> glioblastoma<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:51.699> PJ

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
a microscope a glioblastoma that PJ

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.189 
a microscope a glioblastoma that PJ
might<00:03:52.879> have<00:03:53.090> versus<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.419> glioblastoma<00:03:53.750> one<00:03:54.139> of

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
might have versus a glioblastoma one of

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.080 
might have versus a glioblastoma one of
my<00:03:54.290> other<00:03:54.379> patients<00:03:54.799> might<00:03:54.919> have<00:03:55.129> look<00:03:55.879> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
my other patients might have look the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.000 
my other patients might have look the
same<00:03:56.299> they<00:03:56.750> don't<00:03:56.930> all<00:03:57.019> behave<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.530> same<00:03:57.709> and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
same they don't all behave the same and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.830 
same they don't all behave the same and
I<00:03:58.669> think<00:03:58.849> that's<00:03:59.030> where<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.239> science<00:03:59.660> is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
I think that's where the science is

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.449 
I think that's where the science is
really<00:03:59.989> helping<00:04:00.650> us<00:04:00.799> understand<00:04:01.310> these

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
really helping us understand these

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.430 
really helping us understand these
differences<00:04:02.000> now<00:04:02.209> because<00:04:02.629> they<00:04:03.139> look<00:04:03.319> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
differences now because they look the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.530 
differences now because they look the
same<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.859> pathologist<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:05.060> biology<00:04:05.480> is

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
same to the pathologist the biology is

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.899 
same to the pathologist the biology is
very<00:04:05.690> different<00:04:06.049> and<00:04:06.169> so<00:04:06.859> I<00:04:07.129> can't<00:04:07.519> tell<00:04:07.699> any

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
very different and so I can't tell any

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.360 
very different and so I can't tell any
one<00:04:08.120> individual<00:04:08.659> is<00:04:08.780> going<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.989> do<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.340> I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
one individual is going to do and so I

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.399 
one individual is going to do and so I
don't<00:04:10.790> bother<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.480> much<00:04:11.629> with<00:04:11.810> statistics<00:04:12.290> I'm

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
don't bother so much with statistics I'm

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.899 
don't bother so much with statistics I'm
only<00:04:12.530> concerned<00:04:12.799> about<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.340> individual

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
only concerned about the individual

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.909 
only concerned about the individual
patient<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:15.109> it's<00:04:15.290> almost<00:04:15.470> like<00:04:15.620> it's<00:04:15.829> a

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
patient and so it's almost like it's a

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.909 
patient and so it's almost like it's a
case-by-case<00:04:16.599> analysis<00:04:17.599> of<00:04:18.440> each<00:04:18.530> patient

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
case-by-case analysis of each patient

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.080 
case-by-case analysis of each patient
and<00:04:19.010> what<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:19.190> best<00:04:19.340> approaches<00:04:19.699> for<00:04:20.000> that

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
and what the best approaches for that

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.330 
and what the best approaches for that
patients<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.709> talk<00:04:22.039> about

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
patients and they do talk about

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
patients and they do talk about
personalized<00:04:23.090> medicine<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.169> touch<00:04:24.349> on

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
personalized medicine can you touch on

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.409 
personalized medicine can you touch on
that<00:04:24.560> at<00:04:24.800> all<00:04:24.889> so<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.789> think<00:04:26.030> there's<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.240> big

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
that at all so I think there's a big

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.420 
that at all so I think there's a big
thrust<00:04:26.900> particularly<00:04:27.440> oncology<00:04:28.039> as<00:04:28.190> we<00:04:28.370> learn

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
thrust particularly oncology as we learn

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.710 
thrust particularly oncology as we learn
more<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> biology<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.000> tumors<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:32.690> a

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
more the biology of tumors and so a

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.380 
more the biology of tumors and so a
couple<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.140> concrete<00:04:33.620> examples<00:04:34.130> are

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
couple of concrete examples are

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.760 
couple of concrete examples are
Herceptin<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.810> were<00:04:35.930> talking<00:04:36.110> about<00:04:36.320> Lin

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
Herceptin and you were talking about Lin

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.620 
Herceptin and you were talking about Lin
stage<00:04:37.040> as<00:04:37.730> we<00:04:38.000> learned<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.300> something

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
stage as we learned that something

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.240 
stage as we learned that something
called<00:04:38.780> her2<00:04:38.930> is<00:04:39.290> overexpressed<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:39.860> breast

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
called her2 is overexpressed in breast

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.490 
called her2 is overexpressed in breast
cancer<00:04:40.430> cells<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.300> women<00:04:41.450> who<00:04:41.570> have<00:04:41.780> her

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
cancer cells and so women who have her

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.350 
cancer cells and so women who have her
to<00:04:42.680> positive<00:04:43.130> breast<00:04:43.310> cancer<00:04:43.790> to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
to positive breast cancer to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.210 
to positive breast cancer to
significantly<00:04:45.020> better<00:04:45.290> getting<00:04:45.740> Herceptin

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
significantly better getting Herceptin

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.280 
significantly better getting Herceptin
as<00:04:46.310> part<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.580> their<00:04:46.730> treatment<00:04:47.300> we've<00:04:48.050> learned

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
as part of their treatment we've learned

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.930 
as part of their treatment we've learned
up<00:04:48.440> some<00:04:48.620> subtle<00:04:48.950> things<00:04:49.220> within<00:04:49.490> within

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
up some subtle things within within

up some subtle things within within
glioblastoma<00:04:50.300> something<00:04:51.080> called<00:04:51.200> MGMT<00:04:51.890> as

opposed to the most widespread we know

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.630 
opposed to the most widespread we know
that<00:04:54.260> if<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:54.380> have<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.980> gene<00:04:55.190> turned<00:04:55.490> off

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
that if you have this gene turned off

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.550 
that if you have this gene turned off
you<00:04:56.270> do<00:04:56.420> better<00:04:56.630> responding<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.140> drug<00:04:57.320> called

you do better responding to drug called

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.380 
you do better responding to drug called
temodar<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.220> probably<00:04:58.490> some<00:04:58.610> other<00:04:58.700> drugs

that the pjs working on us we're trying

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
to do this molecular profiling and if

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.920 
to do this molecular profiling and if
you<00:05:07.460> start<00:05:07.610> doing<00:05:07.790> on<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.060> large<00:05:08.300> scale<00:05:08.720> you

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
you start doing on a large scale you

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.990 
you start doing on a large scale you
then<00:05:09.080> understand<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.770> people<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.850> have

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
then understand that people that have

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.400 
then understand that people that have

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
this sort of molecular makeup you know

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.600 
this sort of molecular makeup you know
if<00:05:15.560> they<00:05:15.650> have<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> green<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.130> blue<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.580> red

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.370 
if they have a green a blue and a red
they<00:05:17.390> might<00:05:17.420> respond<00:05:17.960> better<00:05:18.110> than<00:05:18.290> this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
they might respond better than this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.720 
they might respond better than this
treatment<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.830> if<00:05:18.920> somebody<00:05:19.160> has<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.520> yellow
