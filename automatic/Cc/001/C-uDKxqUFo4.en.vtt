00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.410
 good day 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.650
 Well, I think you might already see 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.960
 a little team workout 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.470
 yesterday was the day off guys rested 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.620
 a little emotion today 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:35.630
 made already directly training 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:38.290
 finals with what I am all of you and our policy 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.290
 congratulations 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 The search for the object with the number 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.190
 dive 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.210
 there will be changes i think you will see 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.149
 directly in 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.650
 and the match will say again that all the guys 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.150
 which 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.380
 in good health 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.700
 and is included they are ready 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.570
 participate and are ready to fight 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.520
 cube Gagarin 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.200
 commemorated that this is a very strong team in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.200
 than on your fifth basic posture 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.500
 I think it is very stable experienced 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:32.770
 collective who 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 can patiently bend his line like this 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 match more important was still Andrei Kuteikin 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.550
 in such a final it is important that everyone 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.530
 imbued with the feeling that he 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.800
 got a situation when he makes a holiday 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 they are observer and to do good 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.360
 holiday should be given entirely to this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.179
 the fact that someone had the experience he owes it 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.910
 pass on who has no experience he should 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.960
 listen and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.750
 use this moment which in life 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.090
 maybe not so often those who 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.490
 watched games got hung by 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 TV noticed when commentators 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.540
 talked about prabba rsi they said that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.880
 the team is running talked talking playing 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 will it be a confrontation of work and play 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.990
 on ice 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.470
 without work there can be no game 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.200
 how would we not like to voice that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.420
 game but without 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 very serious labor and systemic 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.660
 approach 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.380
 to their work impossible to achieve 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.950
 the result is therefore here one thing inseparably 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.950
 other 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.400
 Enap defensive your style such 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.320
 ready to fight to the end and that's your opinion 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.130
 who is defensive someone else i 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.720
 I think that albats and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 and our team 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.950
 has its own beautiful 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 performers 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.650
 both attacking style and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.370
 defensive therefore here 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.790
 neglect defense it will crash 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.910
 flaw 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.370
 aggressive attack also will not give anything 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.989
 therefore there must be a balance between 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.000
 all 7 games in Moscow I was a doctor at the scales 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.930
 command on the output goes to the bath out 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.930
 let's leave the medals out 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 is there enough time for emotions to 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.340
 time between and urine 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.620
 I think that when serena ended in 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.349
 all had so many emotions 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.810
 positive that all the more yesterday was 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.690
 weekend i think that 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.030
 be and work play and seek 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.019
 winning the final is already emotional 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.010
 splash so I think in this regard 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.010
 no worries
