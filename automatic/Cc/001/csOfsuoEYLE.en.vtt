look<00:00:49.309> compared<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.410> 2600<00:00:52.410> game<00:00:52.590> um<00:00:53.250> I'm

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
look compared to the 2600 game um I'm

look compared to the 2600 game um I'm
thinking<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.600> look<00:00:54.719> better<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
thinking this would look better on a

screen his mouth I can tell that it's
moving<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.390> quick

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
moving but it's doing it in a very quick

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
moving but it's doing it in a very quick

way that makes it look like it's not

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.620 
way that makes it look like it's not
moving<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.460> slight<00:01:08.460> lag<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
moving because of the slight lag you get

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
this one definitely is it streets ahead

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.729 
this one definitely is it streets ahead
of<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.410> 2600<00:03:35.250> game<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.670> was<00:03:35.850> abysmal<00:03:36.739> though

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
of the 2600 game that was abysmal though

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.039 
of the 2600 game that was abysmal though
I<00:03:37.769> did<00:03:37.950> play<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.610> death<00:03:38.910> back<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.600> day<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
I did play it to death back in the day I

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.860 
I did play it to death back in the day I
definitely<00:03:40.650> wouldn't<00:03:41.160> do<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.340> now

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
definitely wouldn't do that now

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.750 
definitely wouldn't do that now
but<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.590> didn't<00:03:43.830> have<00:03:44.010> many<00:03:44.159> games<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.640> play

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
but I didn't have many games to play

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.539 
but I didn't have many games to play
back<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.330> day<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.659> fact<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:47.280> was<00:03:47.430> the

not an overly difficult version of
pac-man<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.720> got<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.960> be<00:04:51.020> said<00:04:51.230> I'm

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
surviving reasonably well given my

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.480 
surviving reasonably well given my
complete<00:04:54.830> crappiness<00:04:55.790> at<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.750> gal<00:04:57.350> God<00:04:57.920> game

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
complete crappiness at this gal God game

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
complete crappiness at this gal God game
yeah<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> spoke<00:04:59.390> too<00:04:59.570> soon<00:04:59.600> obviously<00:05:04.360> do<00:05:05.360> we

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
yeah I spoke too soon obviously do we

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.570 
yeah I spoke too soon obviously do we
have<00:05:05.540> another<00:05:05.900> look<00:05:06.050> we've<00:05:06.230> got<00:05:06.260> another<00:05:06.620> life

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.070 

probably<00:05:13.580> shouldn't<00:05:14.150> do<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.600> while<00:05:14.840> they're

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
probably shouldn't do that while they're

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.370 
probably shouldn't do that while they're
still<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:16.450> little<00:05:18.880> thing<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:21.200> that

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
still in the little thing and that

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.620 
still in the little thing and that
wasn't<00:05:21.650> good<00:05:21.770> for<00:05:21.800> me<00:05:21.890> score<00:05:22.250> either<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.910> just

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
wasn't good for me score either I just

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.170 
wasn't good for me score either I just
don't<00:05:23.810> care<00:05:23.990> not<00:05:24.950> interested<00:05:25.430> in<00:05:25.550> tactics<00:05:26.030> I

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
don't care not interested in tactics I

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.670 
don't care not interested in tactics I
just<00:05:26.570> want<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.840> get<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.260> next<00:05:27.380> level

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
just want to get to the next level

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.550 
just want to get to the next level
because<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.400> want<00:05:28.760> to<00:05:28.940> be<00:05:29.390> that<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.410> actually

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
because I want to be that it actually

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.470 
because I want to be that it actually
looks<00:05:30.920> exactly<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.520> same<00:05:31.580> as<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.000> last<00:05:32.150> level

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
looks exactly the same as the last level

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.570 
looks exactly the same as the last level
it<00:05:32.780> probably<00:05:33.260> does<00:05:33.470> pay<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.740> go<00:05:34.040> four<00:05:34.220> points

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
it probably does pay to go four points

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.700 
it probably does pay to go four points
more<00:05:34.760> like<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> modern<00:05:35.510> game<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:36.050> there<00:05:36.560> are

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
more like a modern game that there are

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.510 
more like a modern game that there are
other<00:05:36.860> things<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.310> see<00:05:37.670> I<00:05:38.740> usually<00:05:39.740> play<00:05:40.130> games

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
other things to see I usually play games

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.670 
other things to see I usually play games
not<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:41.030> win<00:05:41.180> just<00:05:41.420> to<00:05:41.540> see<00:05:41.780> how<00:05:41.960> far<00:05:42.170> I<00:05:42.230> can<00:05:42.350> get

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
not to win just to see how far I can get

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.320 
not to win just to see how far I can get
to<00:05:42.890> look<00:05:43.250> at<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.550> scenery<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:44.090> pretty

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
to look at the scenery and pretty

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.480 
to look at the scenery and pretty
graphics<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.930> stuff<00:05:45.020> but<00:05:45.980> of<00:05:46.130> course<00:05:46.310> on

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
graphics and stuff but of course on

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.980 
graphics and stuff but of course on
Pacman<00:05:46.700> that's<00:05:47.180> just<00:05:47.510> an<00:05:47.660> absolute

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
Pacman that's just an absolute

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.790 
Pacman that's just an absolute
irrelevance<00:05:48.590> go<00:05:49.430> for<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:49.730> points<00:05:50.410> also<00:05:51.410> like

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
irrelevance go for the points also like

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.360 
irrelevance go for the points also like
to<00:05:51.830> see<00:05:52.130> just<00:05:52.340> how<00:05:52.520> long<00:05:52.760> I<00:05:52.790> can<00:05:53.000> stay<00:05:53.180> alive

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.800 

I<00:06:01.160> was<00:06:02.160> really<00:06:02.550> concerned<00:06:02.760> with<00:06:03.180> points<00:06:03.660> in

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
I was really concerned with points in

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.159 
I was really concerned with points in
any<00:06:03.990> video<00:06:04.380> game<00:06:04.710> is<00:06:04.919> just<00:06:05.190> all<00:06:05.490> about<00:06:06.169> staying

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
any video game is just all about staying

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.930 
any video game is just all about staying
alive<00:06:07.350> as<00:06:07.740> long<00:06:07.770> as<00:06:07.949> possible<00:06:08.100> get<00:06:08.760> your

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
alive as long as possible get your

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.260 
alive as long as possible get your
money's<00:06:09.270> worth<00:06:10.400> arcade<00:06:11.400> games<00:06:11.699> being<00:06:12.060> what

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
money's worth arcade games being what

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.150 
money's worth arcade games being what
they<00:06:12.300> were<00:06:12.690> they<00:06:12.900> didn't<00:06:13.169> last<00:06:13.350> long<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:13.770> you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
they were they didn't last long so you

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040 
they were they didn't last long so you
know<00:06:14.520> if<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.760> got<00:06:14.970> five<00:06:15.270> minutes<00:06:15.600> of<00:06:15.840> gameplay
