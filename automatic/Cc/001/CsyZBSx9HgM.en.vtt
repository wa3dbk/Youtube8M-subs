00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
you know it's pretty much a guaranteed

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.770 
you know it's pretty much a guaranteed
because<00:04:03.950> in<00:04:04.370> case<00:04:04.549> some<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.420> didn't<00:04:05.690> know

as long as you're not terrible at the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.770 
as long as you're not terrible at the
game<00:04:18.880> you're<00:04:19.880> most<00:04:20.000> likely<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.539> get<00:04:20.750> a

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
game you're most likely going to get a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.110 
game you're most likely going to get a
UAV<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.560> ballistic<00:04:21.979> vests<00:04:22.250> if<00:04:22.430> not<00:04:22.610> more<00:04:22.909> in

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
UAV and ballistic vests if not more in

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.760 
UAV and ballistic vests if not more in
this<00:04:23.690> game<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.080> get<00:04:24.229> UAV<00:04:24.680> ballistic<00:04:25.220> vest

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
this game I get UAV ballistic vest

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.700 
this game I get UAV ballistic vest
advanced<00:04:26.610> UAV<00:04:26.759> which<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.479> 12<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.590> had

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
advanced UAV which is like 12 and I had

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.760 
advanced UAV which is like 12 and I had
13<00:04:29.099> or<00:04:29.250> whatever<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:30.419> also<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.349> case<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.650> guys

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
13 or whatever but also in case you guys

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.809 
13 or whatever but also in case you guys
didn't<00:04:32.129> know<00:04:32.599> shooting<00:04:33.599> down<00:04:33.810> UAVs<00:04:34.819> planting

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
didn't know shooting down UAVs planting

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.270 
didn't know shooting down UAVs planting
and<00:04:36.030> defusing<00:04:36.539> bombs<00:04:36.569> all<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.710> gets<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:38.099> all

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
and defusing bombs all that gets up all

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.089 
and defusing bombs all that gets up all
counts<00:04:38.849> towards<00:04:39.300> your<00:04:39.599> strike<00:04:40.500> packets<00:04:40.919> like

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
counts towards your strike packets like

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.830 
counts towards your strike packets like
it<00:04:41.250> counts<00:04:41.639> if<00:04:41.819> you<00:04:41.879> shoot<00:04:42.120> down<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> UAV<00:04:42.659> it

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
it counts if you shoot down the UAV it

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.770 
it counts if you shoot down the UAV it
counts<00:04:43.199> as<00:04:43.319> one<00:04:43.530> towards<00:04:43.919> your<00:04:44.069> kill<00:04:44.280> streak

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
counts as one towards your kill streak

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.659 
counts as one towards your kill streak
so<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.710> case<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.979> guys<00:04:47.069> haven't<00:04:47.129> been<00:04:47.460> doing

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
so in case you guys haven't been doing

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.850 
so in case you guys haven't been doing
that<00:04:47.819> or<00:04:48.120> knowing<00:04:48.449> that<00:04:48.599> if<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.169> two

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
that or knowing that if you have two

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.950 
that or knowing that if you have two
kills<00:04:50.159> and<00:04:50.490> somebody<00:04:51.210> calls<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.569> UAV

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
kills and somebody calls in the UAV

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960 
kills and somebody calls in the UAV
shoot<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.919> down<00:04:53.069> because<00:04:53.550> you're<00:04:53.819> going<00:04:53.909> to

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
shoot it down because you're going to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.520 
shoot it down because you're going to
get<00:04:54.120> UAV<00:04:54.889> because<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.009> counts<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.530> definitely

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
get UAV because it counts so definitely

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.129 
get UAV because it counts so definitely
start<00:04:58.800> doing<00:04:59.069> that<00:04:59.569> but<00:05:00.569> as<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:00.960> see<00:05:01.110> I

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
start doing that but as you can see I

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.800 
start doing that but as you can see I
tried<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.470> plant<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> bomb<00:05:01.949> but<00:05:02.250> no<00:05:02.509> BB<00:05:03.509> big

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
tried to plant the bomb but no BB big

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
that I keep the kill cams and just you

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.059 
that I keep the kill cams and just you
can<00:05:07.770> see<00:05:07.889> where<00:05:08.009> this<00:05:08.099> kid<00:05:08.280> was<00:05:08.900> really<00:05:10.069> big

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069

blue in a subway with a pistol it's like

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.110 
blue in a subway with a pistol it's like
clue<00:05:15.180> right<00:05:15.419> now<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:17.250> guess<00:05:17.580> that's<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:17.909> cool

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
clue right now I guess that's the cool

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.580 
clue right now I guess that's the cool
thing<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.569> just<00:05:18.599> hide<00:05:18.900> in<00:05:19.020> Subway's<00:05:19.409> these

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
thing to do just hide in Subway's these

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.680 
thing to do just hide in Subway's these
days<00:05:19.969> no<00:05:20.969> big<00:05:21.150> deal<00:05:21.919> but<00:05:22.919> uh<00:05:23.180> yeah<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:24.509> there

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
days no big deal but uh yeah so there

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.050 
days no big deal but uh yeah so there
goes<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:27.050> advance<00:05:28.050> was<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:28.949> advanced<00:05:29.400> yo

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
goes the advance was that advanced yo

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.180 
goes the advance was that advanced yo
that<00:05:30.810> was<00:05:30.900> just<00:05:31.050> my<00:05:31.139> UAV<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.590> hadn't<00:05:31.919> used<00:05:32.039> it

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
that was just my UAV I hadn't used it

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.620 
that was just my UAV I hadn't used it
yeah<00:05:32.280> well<00:05:32.490> but<00:05:33.419> um<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:34.099> get<00:05:35.099> a<00:05:35.210> couple<00:05:36.210> kills

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
yeah well but um I get a couple kills

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.070 
yeah well but um I get a couple kills
this<00:05:36.840> round<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.199> think<00:05:38.060> planting<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.150> bomb<00:05:39.330> as

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
this round I think planting the bomb as

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.850 
this round I think planting the bomb as
I<00:05:40.380> said<00:05:40.440> also<00:05:41.219> counts<00:05:41.610> towards<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:43.080> we're

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
I said also counts towards it but we're

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.830 
I said also counts towards it but we're
playing<00:05:44.159> these<00:05:44.400> kids<00:05:44.639> we<00:05:44.789> were<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.449> best<00:05:45.599> part

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
playing these kids we were the best part

hardcore<00:06:18.840> but<00:06:19.139> this<00:06:19.800> game<00:06:20.069> for<00:06:20.400> some<00:06:20.550> reason

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
hardcore but this game for some reason

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.600 
hardcore but this game for some reason
bullets<00:06:21.240> don't<00:06:21.569> kill<00:06:21.990> people<00:06:22.229> so<00:06:22.800> with<00:06:23.190> rapid
