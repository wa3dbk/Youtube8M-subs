00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.379
 we now find that a dog of a 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.200
 neighborhood faced offenders 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.009
 to avoid a theft they in revenge what 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.009
 they killed stabbing 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.719
 they stabbed him to silence him with his 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.490
 barks this dog warned about the 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.529
 presence of a group of criminals 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.290
 I wanted to rob a housing 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.689
 park towers pass the ravine when seen 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.240
 discovered made him several cuts 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.370
 in the body and left him dead close to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.220
 where was his house 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.260
 his name was lightning and for four 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.440
 years he took care of the neighbors of this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 park that he killed had many 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.750
 enemies here because I gave him a dog 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.090
 because he looked after the park 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.740
 and it stabbed the death of lightning 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.680
 it caused consternation among the neighbors 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.090
 who now fear that criminals 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.630
 go to do the same with the others 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.460
 dogs 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.500
 now the other two are in danger 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.230
 remaining that are the kitty and the al 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.020
 pacino then how is it possible already 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.150
 we live in his kit works and it is this 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.150
 little dog that next to ray watched the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.330
 park inside this house of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.490
 Serenazgo de Barranco lives at Pacino 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.600
 they put that name because it has the face 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.360
 cut both are the mute witnesses of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 what happened with lightning while the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.840
 neighbors make conjectures about death 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 of this faithful friend 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.650
 but it's only the only lesson in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.970
 actually a necropsy would help 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.360
 determine the cause of death 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.700
 aside the pacino and kiti suffered in the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.220
 silence they did not want to separate from their 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 friend lightning his adventurous companion 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.100
 ramblings and barks 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 Kitty does not want to see her friend inside 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 some bags wants to see it free running 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 next to her but it's too late 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.740
 the truth I would know to accuse who 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 it was but he had many enemies but 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 more than lightning enemies won many friends 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.270
 who immediately organized his funeral 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.680
 while digging in the earth to 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.650
 bury him the neighbors of the park of 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.860
 peace towers and their inseparable friends and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.020
 you and the pacino said goodbye to lightning 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.620
 can that he died fulfilling his duty of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.620
 vigilant
