00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.929
 Language comes from speaking the kindergarten time is for the 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.899
 linguistic development of children a crucial time APA 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.259
 Language support in early childhood education 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.270
 Children learn language through social interaction and communication 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 the social together is the most important source of language development 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 the world of children's experiences offers a variety of things to talk about 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.530
 to the emergency

 with the file inspection 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.399
 linked with movements 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.990
 make the language easier to internalize 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.910
 Repetition consolidates the learned

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.210
 similar to board 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 I have almost every day 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.170
 Children love rows 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 and the nice stories 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.649
 a backpack filled with objects 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.309
 and that's how the kids together feel a funny fantasy story 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 if I'm not worried 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.960
 The track is celebrating its birthday and wants to celebrate with its friends 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.210
 Language support itself to the abilities and interests of the children 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.430
 on 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 the desire to tell motivates you to speak 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.969
 all are invited colorful and curious 7 the free gymnasts 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.600

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 embed 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.480
 It takes place as a cross-cutting task in various areas 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.290
 for example, by the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 for movement in the natural sciences or active media work 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.480

 Great idea Zurich 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.419
 Media work is always teamwork 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.900
 Sharing ideas 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.000
 and the next steps plan the exchange is always skipped over 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.250
 Therefore, the work is suitable for language promotion 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.349
