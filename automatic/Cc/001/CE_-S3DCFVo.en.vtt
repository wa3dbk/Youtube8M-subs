00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
from negri electronics let's check it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:24.410 
from negri electronics let's check it
out<00:00:20.600> first<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:23.420> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
out first off what we have here is the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.920 
out first off what we have here is the
first<00:00:24.720> smartphone<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.010> dual<00:00:26.490> core<00:00:26.930> 1

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
first smartphone with a dual core 1

first smartphone with a dual core 1
gigahertz<00:00:28.260> Tegra<00:00:29.130> 2<00:00:29.160> chipset<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:31.130> that<00:00:32.130> should

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
gigahertz Tegra 2 chipset so that should

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
gigahertz Tegra 2 chipset so that should
be<00:00:32.489> pretty<00:00:32.610> fast<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> check<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> out

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
be pretty fast when I check that out

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.580 
be pretty fast when I check that out
pretty<00:00:34.170> soon<00:00:34.940> maybe<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> video<00:00:36.590> but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
pretty soon maybe not in this video but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
pretty soon maybe not in this video but
we've<00:00:37.800> also<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> European

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
we've also got this one is a European

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.610 
we've also got this one is a European
version<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.730> GSM<00:00:44.730> 850<00:00:45.390> 900<00:00:45.620> 1800

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
version so it's got GSM 850 900 1800

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.090 
version so it's got GSM 850 900 1800
1900<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:49.500> 3g<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.969> 920<00:00:51.960> 100<00:00:52.440> bands<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
1900 and a 3g on the 920 100 bands so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.959 
1900 and a 3g on the 920 100 bands so
that<00:00:54.059> means<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.870> won't<00:00:55.110> work<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.800> 3g<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.430> ATT

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that means it won't work for 3g on ATT

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.020 
that means it won't work for 3g on ATT
or<00:00:57.239> tmobile<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> US<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.670> will<00:00:59.850> in

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
course Wi-Fi bluetooth all of that and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
course Wi-Fi bluetooth all of that and
there's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> FM<00:01:20.460> radio<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.000> their<00:01:21.890> gps<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.430> know

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there's a FM radio in their gps you know

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
there's a FM radio in their gps you know
the<00:01:23.909> usual<00:01:23.939> stuff<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> let's<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.119> look<00:01:27.390> at

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the usual stuff so let's take a look at

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.600 
the usual stuff so let's take a look at
the<00:01:28.500> screen<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.939> compares<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.020> say<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the screen how compares to say the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.859 
the screen how compares to say the
galaxy<00:01:35.610> s<00:01:35.729> 4g<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> let's<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:39.540> same

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
galaxy s 4g so let's get the same

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.889 
galaxy s 4g so let's get the same
websites<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.880> ok<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:41.939> both<00:01:42.240> these<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.689> auto

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
websites up ok so both these have auto

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
websites up ok so both these have auto
brightness<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.520> LG<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
brightness on and you can see the LG is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.800 
brightness on and you can see the LG is
a<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.090> brighter<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> whites<00:01:50.810> if

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a little bit brighter on the whites if

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
a little bit brighter on the whites if
you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.430> then<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you can see that but then we have the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.289 
you can see that but then we have the
screen<00:01:54.750> comparison<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> let's<00:01:56.610> take<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> look

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
screen comparison so let's take a look

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.800 
screen comparison so let's take a look
at<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.840> LG<00:02:01.340> got<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.640> nice<00:02:02.880> little

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
at the LG got some really nice little

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.319 
at the LG got some really nice little
build<00:02:04.110> quality<00:02:04.409> features<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> see

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
build quality features here you can see

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.150 
build quality features here you can see
right<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> screen<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> edges<00:02:08.039> are

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
right there the screen the edges are

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.100 
right there the screen the edges are
kind<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.550> curved<00:02:09.030> down

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 

that's<00:02:12.350> pretty<00:02:12.560> cool<00:02:12.800> easier<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.460> one<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's pretty cool easier on one on the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.940 
that's pretty cool easier on one on the
edge<00:02:13.910> there<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.350> capacitive

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
edge there and we have capacitive

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.720
