00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
there click you see what that branch

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.729 
there click you see what that branch
dips<00:00:37.670> down<00:00:38.020> okay<00:00:39.020> just<00:00:39.290> come<00:00:39.650> around

dips down okay just come around
underneath<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.340> branch<00:00:40.610> there<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.750> most

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
underneath that branch there the most

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.049 
underneath that branch there the most
obvious<00:00:42.290> way<00:00:42.470> of<00:00:42.500> shooting<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.129> scene<00:00:43.400> is<00:00:43.850> to

shoot from here with that top light from

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.610 
shoot from here with that top light from
underneath<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.790> trees<00:00:47.030> gone<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:48.200> then<00:00:48.379> sort

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
underneath the trees gone and then sort

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.560 
underneath the trees gone and then sort
of<00:00:48.680> soft<00:00:48.980> light<00:00:49.130> coming<00:00:49.460> through<00:00:49.570> but

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
of soft light coming through but

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.780 
of soft light coming through but

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
silhouette and I'll be quite a dramatic

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.070 
silhouette and I'll be quite a dramatic
structure<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.030> design<00:01:50.180> in<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> picture

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
structure and design in the picture

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.810 
structure and design in the picture
let's<00:01:51.350> take<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> look
