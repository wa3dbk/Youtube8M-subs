00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello and good day today a new one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.120
 video from my printer though it is in 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.040
 this video is less printer 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.929
 but more about the plasticity of it 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.330
 is processed 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 I had problems with plastic that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 First, the plastic in the nozzle 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.070
 got stuck and not there 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 wanted to get out more and secondly 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.600
 that the temperature is extremely high 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.090
 had to print that at all 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.380
 can 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.399
 Let's start, I have one with it 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 red plastic printed times and I have 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.610
 it with another this the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.210
 Temperature can then increase very far 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.250
 until at all that came out and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 As you can see here the pressure is up to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 certain point works and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.969
 At some point, only small ones are left 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.640
 things come out of jets until at all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.640
 nothing more the same here too 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.320
 our seed is printed here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.699
 already started to print that in a lot 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 and then no later than below 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 nothing more and you then, of course 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810
 from what seen from plastic what then 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.659
 a plastic look at it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.100
 hope that I then the length 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.159
 Research screw in the plastic 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 purely eaten has, as I said, there are 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 Two things had happened 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 at the same time but have joined 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.830
 once that plastic in the nozzle 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570
 gets stuck and once I die 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.670
 temperature continues and on and on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.420
 and further increase with it at all 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.189
 that comes out it becomes obvious 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 That's why I'm doing this now 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.840
 video he has a problem of storage 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 have been 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.630
 First, you have to yes you should the plastic 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.540
 So do not store dry like I do 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.579
 before that had been easy before 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.899
 lying somewhere in the room on one 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.829
 heap still dusty picture and 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 but let it draw humidity 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.710
 It's best to put it in any bag 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.410
 a son with you look at this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.950
 have in it below 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:12.360
 These new packaging are usually 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.650
 for small warm sound bags in it and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.300
 then just stop until the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.950
 damp again hermetically seal 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.220
 so that no air moisture is drawn 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.030
 so that I am also beginning to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.650
 right because I thought so far 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.060
 now what the last three roll well 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 works why 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.000
 maybe we are not currently setting 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
 too much humidity and yes good 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 Humidity was not mine 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.820
 only problem so of course it will 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.020
 Hardly have that humidity 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.500
 still been pulled 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.560
 but I also have a new role to play 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.340
 Newly packaged was also with this 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.489
 packet in it so airtight and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.290
 unpacked and tried and still is 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.040
 then the plastic stuck me 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.950
 and yes I have the temperature on 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.110
 must increase as it could be printed 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.430
 by temperature increase have come 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.430
 and I was wondering what is it 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.980
 is it what is the second reason the uno 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.040
 had in addition to the problem that blessed 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.290
 Frequency I 've drawn uv-light 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.560
 I had it in the window 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.519
 as well as the light in the painting 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 room and around that was show here I have 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.230
 a normal piece abs plastic and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.390
 if you bend that now then you realize 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes I can bend offer bend 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.989
 then it will be white and not only when 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.549
 it is back and forth bg and now 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.150
 broken and has a break point 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.000
 so not focused here either 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.810
 reinbekommen yes as you get that 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.489
 presents 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.019
 and here i have the abs plastic 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.090
 So a ABS plastic under 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.480
 this uv light so I think that stv 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.150
 Light is because it's the normal thing 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.090
 are the uv light causes when i am 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.190
 now here's bad the way it is 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.090
 on the side that's how you get it here 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.280
 looks 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.650
 quite randomly on the one hand 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.690
 it breaks easily on the other 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.530
 Side can be seen many bending 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.150
 that here 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 I'm back and here too 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.220
 Again, as I said, it's pretty 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.500
 by chance when that breaks and was lost 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.660
 that has to offer that's why has also 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.190
 works and then not because I 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.680
 Just believe that this rotten thing 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.210
 plastic has changed so that has 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.210
 then yes worse has come out or 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 from the feed screw here too 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.360
 sometimes points to this hard 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.690
 come because the researchers have 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.639
 Eat it pure because it's plastic 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.479
 I sprayed that too 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:59.310
 piece of fiala with it the same 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:02.310
 If I break that then it will happen 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.410
 unlike normal now is that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.340
 but I still look normal 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:17.150
 where hopefully that will not happen 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:23.400
 happened so is a bit off 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:28.260
 since that is bÃ©la kubick plo is indeed 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.849
 brittle than okay it is not fragile 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.220
 here 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.430
 you can see it is in target 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:41.550
 Chewing gum of Hizbullah and the other 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:45.960
 that also just under uv light if 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.190
 Breaking little things is broken 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.200
 I do not want to stop long now 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.610
 but I like that as plastic 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.560
 I said I had problems today 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.349
 first train humidity and then 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.910
 by uv light in addition and then 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.410
 I have solved the problems only so 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.660
 We want to buy new plastic 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.460
 the porno of electronics offers but 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.889
 I update in the channel second aptn 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.240
 video had already addressed that 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.500
 Here is first with the plastic 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.330
 You have printed here and there 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.010
 a little better so small 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.539
 threads of draws, it is because I still with 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.740
 I ran at very high temperatures 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.159
 because today I was still afraid of 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.450
 other plastic but as I said a new one 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.450
 so well stored plastic 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.559
 sells the problems and as I said 

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:36.629
 even if it is repackaged when it is in the 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:38.939
 It is still possible to enjoy sunlight 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.419
 the plastic there have been broken 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.119
 his 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.259
 so now my tip to the end 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:49.139
 Plastic is always protected from light 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:51.659
 Keep dry and if you are now 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.360
 bursts bought because you do not know how I 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:56.339
 has been believed if plastic one 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.019
 kilogram 30 euro costs then is now 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.300
 a good price to be stored well or 

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:01.709
 even having been made that 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.219
 means when it comes to them is that 

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:06.779
 it's 2000 or so if it's plastic less 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.849
 costs as if one thinks that one 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:10.499
 can save five euros or so with it 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.539
 it may also be a plastic that 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.309
 I have been stored for a long time 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:17.009
 me also someone about the comments 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:20.159
 that's all that then 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:21.809
 plastic under 30 euro something bad 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:24.479
 can be and that you have to be lucky 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:27.209
 that good one caught very well that 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.309
 It was I hope I could ring now 

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:32.179
 that brought me plastic then right 

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:36.119
 to make sure it does not break and 

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:38.239
 I move the camera when I move the camera 

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:41.759
 even not protected yet 

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:45.749
 here in the shoe also everything again extra 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:47.819
 wrap in the extra film so that 

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:51.419
 also the air humidity is protected 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:53.839
 So many thanks for seeing and one 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:53.839
 Have a good time
