I<00:01:07.780> think<00:01:07.900> about<00:01:08.080> this<00:01:08.350> mod<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:08.560> would<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:09.070> say

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
I think about this mod I would just say

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.850 
I think about this mod I would just say
something<00:01:09.760> like<00:01:10.110> let's<00:01:11.110> continue<00:01:11.500> with<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
something like let's continue with the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.789 
something like let's continue with the
next<00:01:11.890> mod<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.750> pretty<00:01:14.080> useful<00:01:14.350> one

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
next mod and this is a pretty useful one

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.090 
next mod and this is a pretty useful one
which<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.400> called<00:01:15.640> grind<00:01:15.970> stuff<00:01:17.100> basically

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
which is called grind stuff basically

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.120 
which is called grind stuff basically
you<00:01:18.520> can<00:01:18.790> now<00:01:19.180> create<00:01:19.990> self<00:01:20.560> at<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.830> grain

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
you can now create self at the grain

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.460 
you can now create self at the grain
mill<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.730> just<00:01:22.570> activated<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.350> have

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
mill and you just activated you have

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.380 
mill and you just activated you have
your<00:01:23.650> little<00:01:23.920> animation<00:01:24.460> which<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.910> little

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
your little animation which is a little

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.500 
your little animation which is a little
bit<00:01:25.510> weird<00:01:25.750> for<00:01:25.930> me<00:01:26.410> because<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:27.150> spawned<00:01:28.150> this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
bit weird for me because I spawned this

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.320 
bit weird for me because I spawned this
grain<00:01:28.900> mill<00:01:29.110> per<00:01:29.320> console<00:01:29.800> command<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.430> then

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
grain mill per console command and then

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.630 
grain mill per console command and then
there<00:01:31.690> are<00:01:31.810> different<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.620> recites<00:01:33.160> which

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
there are different and recites which

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.590 
there are different and recites which
you<00:01:33.760> can<00:01:33.940> craft<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.740> pretty<00:01:36.010> pretty

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you can craft and this is pretty pretty

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.930 
you can craft and this is pretty pretty
awesome<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.930> think<00:01:38.230> that's<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.440> very<00:01:38.620> good<00:01:38.770> idea

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
awesome I think that's a very good idea

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.130 
awesome I think that's a very good idea
just<00:01:39.940> just<00:01:40.210> one<00:01:40.510> little<00:01:40.720> bark<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.570> seems

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
just just one little bark but it seems

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.840 
just just one little bark but it seems
like<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.680> little<00:01:45.010> bit<00:01:45.130> harder<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.490> fix

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
like this is a little bit harder to fix

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
like this is a little bit harder to fix
you<00:01:46.480> see<00:01:46.690> here<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.200> after<00:01:47.530> some<00:01:47.740> time<00:01:47.980> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you see here that after some time I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560 
you see here that after some time I
stopped<00:01:50.200> crafting<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.760> Mona<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:52.180> already

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
stopped crafting but Mona is already

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.500 
stopped crafting but Mona is already
searching<00:01:53.080> for<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> solution<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.070> and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
searching for a solution for that and

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.170 
searching for a solution for that and
this<00:01:55.510> more<00:01:55.720> dog<00:01:56.020> races<00:01:56.530> adds<00:01:56.770> five<00:01:57.370> new<00:01:57.760> races

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
this more dog races adds five new races
