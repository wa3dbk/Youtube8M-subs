00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:34.640
 here she is made she friends ten 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 on the lathe as we do for 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 you friction on the cone of the other side of the rep 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:59.510
 also a dozen and put on the washer and welded 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:01:05.119
 stop profile pipe profile pipe 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:09.470
 4 to 2 position issue to 2 and a half 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:14.369
 then the court itself means to say the length 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:22.560
 how would the working parts to 9 nine just 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 tooth 15 each tooth how could they 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.330
 removable when can be unscrewed 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:36.060
 replace all of a sudden what I will tell you your 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:38.100
 the past didn't work break his atom yes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 for something to call some concrete 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 catch on to be bent off or 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.470
 broke that is no at all as if 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 no comments works fine I 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:59.220
 pleased with this mill 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.930
 spring how could I not why am I 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.180
 autumn all 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.530
 then plowed in spring like my dad 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.580
 passed two colors like a cross for one 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.840
 plain 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.840
 resisting a second time 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.300
 so what makes it look like 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.940
 profiled tube up to 4 to 2 and a half 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.920
 centimeters between profiles which corner 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.840
 there is no difference how it can not be enemies 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:42.240
 Four 3 pipe profile distance 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:45.780
 between my teeth is also 15 between all 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.780
 here is a nuance 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:03:02.130
 3 rows of teeth for example the next sound like 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 would not get after this sound 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.220
 slightly to make following it 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.600
 also need to demolish the same back to 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 also not a dad. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.000
 that is, in fact, like this 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:23.459
 let's show like this on the ground well 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:37.239
 now the yeast between the trail of this 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:37.930
 its distance but I did with us 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.610
 it turns out 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:50.019
 we see every sound behind the pictures though here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:55.930
 15 but in the end, after all the rows 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:59.170
 you can come here and so five 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:07.120
 centimeters such are the tracks every 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:18.669
 go does your job further me 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:20.350
 adapted at the entrance clamped height 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.640
 if i have three holes i mean i 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:30.700
 I exhibit my convenience goes on 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:33.550
 so here on the hinges in the hinge of the Tatars 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.229
 on works here for what purpose 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:45.849
 so that the baron would repeat 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:47.950
 but the kidney is playing itself all is normal 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.590
 it turns out the angle of attack itself 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.630
 She stands there, you can change, that is, you can 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.430
 so that more then the garden of sheep is rounded 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.370
 it is possible to more deeply 1 h 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.820
 front but I expose and a little bit like a 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.340
 if so forward goes and I exhibit 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.960
 slightly to carry the transfer 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:19.320
 so it turns out more or less everything 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:23.890
 beautiful distance means distance 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.520
 let's get behind me again 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:34.450
 one two three 4 5 6 7 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:42.430
 this is the first time two three 4 5 six 7 8 2 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:48.010
 a row of not two times three 4 5 six between these 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:51.630
 rows me twenty twenty 20 centimeters 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.630
 here and here 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:06:00.340
 yes even forgot to say pendulum too 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.069
 level cross angle is regulated 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.169
 tilt need to put you can generally 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.169
 pinch to it that there was a dead 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:18.219
 all I wanted to say would be such 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:23.289
 write some questions try to see 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:26.529
 me new videos i like to grow 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:35.789
 Almost all told that they all mattress 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:35.789
 more often from dogwood tara I may be 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.300
 goodbye everyone thank you ksiva
