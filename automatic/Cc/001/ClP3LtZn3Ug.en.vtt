00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.220
 and everyone is for marianne 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 goal Sunday on beds watch the theme 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 of the week it was to talk to you a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.740
 little of our first quarter of the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 return and so on the tale a little bit 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 on the accolade of one is not all in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.210
 the same class we have a little bit of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 different school paths 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 so me as I told you in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.369
 the presentation was in boarding school without 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.720
 really interesting not bad so I have a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.609
 I can not tell you how my return 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 went on about that how do I get 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 am integrated notes start at no 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 how does it go as if in second 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.469
 a bit of the industry that I do 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 thingy 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.420
 already at the beginning of the year I had some great 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.250
 good mark 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 I did not count the senses the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.540
 coefficients a comfortable touch with 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 the coefficients I had 14 15 and but 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.809
 in fact it was when I had 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 not too many late peeps I was talking about 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.510
 people and everything but not so much in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.750
 studies I was focused I was doing my 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 homework 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 except that since I met more 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.410
 of people in studies I am much less 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 concentrated and I'm talking more it's the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 second hour above which we speak and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 we do anything and suddenly my 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.980
 beasts they really went down and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.280
 now I am below the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 average 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.090
 so here we go but I think not sparing 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.220
 catching up with me 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 so for the notes it does not happen too much 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 well right now after the chef 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 internat said it was 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.450
 completely normal that are worth a time 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.040
 of adaptation and that's so I try to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 not too worried but it's true that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 it stresses me a little to the bottom otherwise bah 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 apart from it going well neither your friends and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 cetera that price I could say with 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.840
 swimming and so on and a lot of people 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.820
 who could not come this week from 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.619
 last three were in training but he 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.090
 there's really a pretty good atmosphere 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.409
 after there are people here are really 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.299
 problems for nothing we do not understand 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.579
 too much but it's okay there is a pretty good 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.540
 ambience 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.979
 by the way we will make a video on 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.630
 the boys' internet that I would put 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.979
 on my personal channel by two 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.180
 weeks we will spend the evening with the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.700
 guys who will make a video on their 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.810
 internat so if you 're interested go 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.000
 subscribe to the channel and will be in 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.360
 line in two to three weeks a trick 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 like that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.299
 in fact I did not have any actor 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.340
 is it because I know I'm not 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.110
 scientist at all and I want to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.210
 do it because I'm scared that it's me 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.830
 shut doors if I saw that I know 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.560
 not really what I want to do and the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.950
 So I thought I was going to do are 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 except that the teacher 2s of saving it is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.940
 really rubbish 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 well, that's what we took too much 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.450
 head with him cures no one 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.070
 understands nothing so I'm a little 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.630
 lost right now tell me what you 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.460
 you intend to do and what profession you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.570
 want to do but I mean when 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.080
 you do not know what you laugh like 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.340
 Dairy it's a bit hot to have 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 in the future so if I really know 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 not what to do I think I vs 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 but it is necessary that the day of launch 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.580
 months and years all these fifteen pages 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.600
 otherwise it's very happy of my own 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.190
 language and I got too confused 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 with her music now makes it to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 each time, however, the appellate judges 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 vince that I knew not I speak English 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.140
 really and suddenly English classes 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.190
 it really does not help me so I sleep 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.510
 in english class shoes like that 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 on my table and for a moment she 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.560
 ask me marianne what is the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.690
 answer to this question and I have him 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 pulled out a fucking paragraph in English 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.040
 at the same time overall and internat 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
 good but you have to hang on 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.330
 finally there is so much distraction there 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.700
 there are so many opportunities for this 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.739
 give is the same as here it is necessary 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.170
 know how to say no at a time and say 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.500
 no today I'm working and stuff 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.320
 like that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.540
 and so now I am 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.370
 returned to work no I was 17 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.320

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.049

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.720
