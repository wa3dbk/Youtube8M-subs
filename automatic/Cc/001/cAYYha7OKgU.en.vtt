00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 so new about likes we put on yesterday 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.780
 panel processed shows how 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.780
 shake well 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.160
 do 1 2 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.160
 serpent like 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.550
 and went movement 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.320
 everywhere the same, I think as demand 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:59.449
 without just so next time go 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:01:05.880
 following line and distribute 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.450
 no pressure weight is just our task 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.729
 apply 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 no way the surface is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 scratch the plate was applied 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:25.740
 Yesterday we pass through the likes of it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.920
 it was all neatly applied gives 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 stand up a bit 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.539
 It is also checked as you check about 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.299
 drying module can be checked from below 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.479
 here, in principle, here it is already dried up 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.340
 you can still wait 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.739
 light movements start it gently 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.590
 wash gently 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.590
 first comes a little slow down 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.410
 slows down to a little bit and the light 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 overturned and generally light 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.869
 like movements need more bark 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.869
 will remain subject will serve better 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.680
 a drier surface could 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.680
 wait he often walk 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.330
 as a tribute to octopus 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.860
 just a minute 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.400
 but it's all visible 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.220
 bark is generally a very light product 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.430
 the main thing to do is try it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.230
 remove more plate here for everything 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.020
 glistened 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.460
 still become saturated and it will be 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.460
 analysts very long shelter 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.560
 also stayed very much here i can 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.810
 show here the sport on processed 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.300
 six months ago this is after me 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.330
 processed it has already passed six months she 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.060
 roughly speaking in just one layer bro 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.690
 sunset here all the same will be white 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.730
 was it the same was white so now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.860
 let's go one more time take arises 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.070
 very easy god like our glide 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:49.140
 Generally here on the surface through 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.140
 slips means he already with us almost 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:58.470
 completely light stains they are on the eyes and 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.470
 quietly go 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:19.609
 Well , that's how beautiful we are 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.520
 it turns out mammoth climb without skips 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.979
 when applied because skipping 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.979
 they will not be remembered so nothing 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.240
 that's the whole 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.860
 thank you for your attention
