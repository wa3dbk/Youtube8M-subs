we start with himself right hand we will

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.390 
we start with himself right hand we will
use<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.700> sharp<00:01:17.600> C<00:01:18.230> sharp<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.979> epsilon<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.920> this

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
use a sharp C sharp and epsilon so this

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.820 
use a sharp C sharp and epsilon so this
is<00:01:22.580> one<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:24.410> we<00:01:24.680> go<00:01:25.240> C<00:01:26.240> sharp<00:01:26.570> F<00:01:26.840> sub<00:01:27.320> the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
is one and there we go C sharp F sub the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
is one and there we go C sharp F sub the
left<00:01:28.040> hand<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:28.550> one<00:01:28.880> two<00:01:29.570> three<00:01:30.580> then<00:01:31.580> with

pres<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.180> right<00:01:32.540> hand<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.410> four<00:01:33.880> then

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
pres the right hand this is four then

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.950 
pres the right hand this is four then
five<00:01:35.380> six<00:01:36.380> C<00:01:36.890> sharp<00:01:37.220> F<00:01:37.400> sharp<00:01:37.460> again<00:01:38.119> then

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
five six C sharp F sharp again then

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.540 
five six C sharp F sharp again then
right<00:01:39.619> nine<00:01:39.920> again<00:01:40.280> seven<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.300> then<00:01:42.290> C<00:01:42.530> son<00:01:42.770> so

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
right nine again seven and then C son so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.980 
right nine again seven and then C son so
base<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.210> right<00:01:46.509> four<00:01:47.509> five<00:01:48.170> six<00:01:49.060> seven<00:01:50.060> eight

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
base and right four five six seven eight

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.290 
base and right four five six seven eight
so<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.340> what<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.670> happening<00:01:52.700> in<00:01:53.180> the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
so this is what is happening in the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.050 
so this is what is happening in the
first<00:01:53.540> chord<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.290> idea<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:55.550> will<00:01:55.759> play

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
first chord and this idea this will play

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.030 
first chord and this idea this will play
we<00:01:56.210> can<00:01:56.360> apply<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.290> next<00:01:57.740> chord

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
we can apply it to all the next chord

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.430 
we can apply it to all the next chord
the<00:01:58.250> following<00:01:58.550> course<00:01:58.820> one<00:01:59.479> two<00:01:59.780> three<00:02:00.110> four

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the following course one two three four

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.850 

one<00:02:05.610> two<00:02:06.210> three<00:02:06.800> five<00:02:07.800> six<00:02:08.280> seven

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.360 

play<00:02:13.860> eight<00:02:14.130> plus<00:02:14.550> eight<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.690> itself

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.580 

then<00:02:21.790> we<00:02:21.909> go<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.330> next<00:02:22.659> chord<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.319> we<00:02:23.409> do

then we go to the next chord and we do

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.020 
then we go to the next chord and we do
exactly<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.310> same<00:02:24.340> thing

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
exactly the same thing

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.289 
exactly the same thing
the<00:02:25.480> second<00:02:26.379> chord<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.769> C<00:02:26.980> sharp<00:02:27.900> major<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.000> we

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
the second chord is C sharp major and we

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.039 
the second chord is C sharp major and we
play<00:02:31.720> C<00:02:32.170> sharp<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.830> bass<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> right

now we've got to be sharp minor we do

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.339 
now we've got to be sharp minor we do
exactly<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.879> same<00:03:32.909> thing<00:03:33.329> always<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.989> start

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
exactly the same thing always we start

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.220 
exactly the same thing always we start
with<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> base<00:03:35.269> together<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.749> the<00:03:36.870> cord<00:03:37.109> on

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
with a base together with the cord on

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.780 
with a base together with the cord on
the<00:03:37.349> right<00:03:37.379> hand<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.069> then<00:03:38.189> we'll<00:03:38.370> play<00:03:38.609> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the right hand and then we'll play the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.679 
the right hand and then we'll play the
rest<00:03:38.999> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> keys

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
rest of the keys

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.289 
rest of the keys
so<00:03:40.170> here<00:03:40.469> the<00:03:40.590> base<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.799> dissolve<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:42.090> right

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
so here the base is dissolve the right

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.470 
so here the base is dissolve the right
fan<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.749> a<00:03:42.900> star<00:03:43.620> C<00:03:43.980> sub<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> f<00:03:44.730> sorrow<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.329> is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
fan is a star C sub and f sorrow this is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:04:09.710 
fan is a star C sub and f sorrow this is
1<00:03:45.980> 2<00:03:46.980> 3<00:03:54.169> 5<00:03:55.169> 6

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.270 

and<00:04:10.080> then<00:04:10.230> we<00:04:10.380> go<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.920> last<00:04:11.550> board<00:04:13.280> which

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
and then we go to the last board which

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
and then we go to the last board which
is<00:04:14.460> B<00:04:14.730> major<00:04:15.950> here<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.130> start<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:17.959> B<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.500> the
