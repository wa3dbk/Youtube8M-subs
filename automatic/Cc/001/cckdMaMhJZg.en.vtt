00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
think his laws like strategy to try to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
think his laws like strategy to try to
get<00:01:03.809> either<00:01:04.379> Cesar<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.339> doflamingo<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.510> a

go and arrest him because he stepped

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
go and arrest him because he stepped
down<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.650> he's<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.009> another<00:01:41.220> pirate<00:01:41.670> again

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
down so he's just another pirate again

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
down so he's just another pirate again
and<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:43.229> could<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.590> his<00:01:43.890> strategies<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and that could be his strategies like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
and that could be his strategies like
you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.149> they're<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.420> come<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> but

you know they're gonna come and but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.830 
you know they're gonna come and but
thing<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.460> send<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.840> regular

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
thing is if they just send like regular

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.300 
thing is if they just send like regular
Marines<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.540> nothing<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
Marines it's not going to be nothing and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.440 
Marines it's not going to be nothing and
him<00:01:53.310> giving<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.640> heads<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> smoker<00:01:54.149> a

him giving the heads up the smoker a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600 
him giving the heads up the smoker a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
dogs though for me going no pushover he

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.840 
dogs though for me going no pushover he
just<00:01:58.619> beat<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> living<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> me

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
just beat the living out of me

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
just beat the living out of me
that's<00:02:00.810> making<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's making me think that as a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
that's making me think that as a
possibility<00:02:02.210> maybe<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> Admirals<00:02:03.869> might

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
possibility maybe the Admirals might

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.480 
possibility maybe the Admirals might
show<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.320> maybe<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> reasons

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
show up maybe that's one of the reasons

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.690 
show up maybe that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.810> Admiral<00:02:07.229> fujitora<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.280> that's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
why the Admiral fujitora is there that's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
why the Admiral fujitora is there that's
possibly<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> things<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.770> whole

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
possibly one of the things and the whole

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.530 
possibly one of the things and the whole
thing<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> basically<00:02:11.520> come<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.030> nap

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
thing is to basically come and nap

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.539 
thing is to basically come and nap
flamingo<00:02:13.019> if<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.709> it'll<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.519> a

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
flamingo if they can and it'll be a

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.670

that<00:02:49.439> at<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.680> given<00:02:49.950> point<00:02:50.250> Bellamy<00:02:50.579> has<00:02:50.669> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that at some given point Bellamy has a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.780 
that at some given point Bellamy has a
very<00:02:51.030> big<00:02:51.750> role<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.560> he<00:02:52.829> might<00:02:53.099> because<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
very big role and he might because I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.640 
very big role and he might because I
don't<00:02:53.939> think<00:02:54.120> Oda<00:02:54.269> order<00:02:54.840> rarely<00:02:55.230> brings<00:02:55.439> back

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
don't think Oda order rarely brings back

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.159 
don't think Oda order rarely brings back
a<00:02:55.680> character<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.430> ever<00:02:57.299> bring<00:02:57.810> back<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
a character if ever bring back the

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.869 
a character if ever bring back the
character<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.769> does<00:02:59.280> absolutely<00:02:59.639> nothing

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
character and does absolutely nothing

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.080 
character and does absolutely nothing
with<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.359> character<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.109> I'm<00:03:01.230> guessing<00:03:01.560> that

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
with the character so I'm guessing that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.759 
with the character so I'm guessing that
but<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.599> know<00:03:03.629> he'll<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.109> his<00:03:04.319> moment

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
but you know he'll have his moment

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.280 
but you know he'll have his moment
Bellamy<00:03:05.129> but<00:03:05.849> it'll<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.239> up<00:03:06.359> for<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.659> while<00:03:06.780> from

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
Bellamy but it'll be up for a while from

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.500 
Bellamy but it'll be up for a while from
now<00:03:07.349> it'll<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.799> maybe<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.189> later<00:03:08.579> arc<00:03:08.879> sometime

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
now it'll be maybe a later arc sometime

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.390 
now it'll be maybe a later arc sometime
in<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.689> future<00:03:09.840> he'll<00:03:10.439> have<00:03:10.680> his<00:03:10.829> moment<00:03:11.220> but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
in the future he'll have his moment but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.559 
in the future he'll have his moment but
right<00:03:11.430> now<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:11.879> wasn't<00:03:12.239> it's<00:03:12.329> time<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
right now it just wasn't it's time to

shine<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.290> also<00:03:13.439> made<00:03:13.739> me<00:03:13.769> curious<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
shine and it also made me curious as to

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.270 
shine and it also made me curious as to
why<00:03:15.239> they're<00:03:15.480> bartholomae<00:03:16.139> I'll<00:03:16.290> make<00:03:17.099> this

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
why they're bartholomae I'll make this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.129 
why they're bartholomae I'll make this
weird<00:03:17.549> face<00:03:17.819> when<00:03:18.030> he<00:03:18.150> heard<00:03:18.299> movie<00:03:18.629> wat<00:03:18.780> aside
