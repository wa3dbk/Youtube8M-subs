00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.539 

now<00:00:12.509> let's<00:00:12.690> figure<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> what's<00:00:13.920> causing<00:00:14.190> this

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
now let's figure out what's causing this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.120 
now let's figure out what's causing this
physics<00:00:15.269> reaction<00:00:15.780> when<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.770> shouldn't<00:00:17.070> be

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
physics reaction when it shouldn't be

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130 
physics reaction when it shouldn't be
happening<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.900> since<00:00:21.900> we're<00:00:22.109> doing

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
happening so since we're doing

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.470 
happening so since we're doing
everything<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> physics<00:00:23.910> engine

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
everything with the physics engine

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.790 
everything with the physics engine
there<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.019> times<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> want

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
there are times and we're going to want

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410 
there are times and we're going to want
to<00:00:25.890> turn<00:00:26.160> off<00:00:26.310> our<00:00:26.580> physics<00:00:26.970> engine<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to turn off our physics engine to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.009 
to turn off our physics engine to
prevent<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.289> kind<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.590> behavior<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> we're

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
prevent that kind of behavior so we're

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.440 
prevent that kind of behavior so we're
going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.320> make<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.650> function<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.460> called

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.490 

toggle<00:00:36.890> physics<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> take

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
toggle physics and this is going to take

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
toggle physics and this is going to take
a<00:00:40.739> ball<00:00:41.600> is<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:45.050> or<00:00:46.370> yeah<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:47.520> fine<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
a ball is on or yeah that's fine and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
a ball is on or yeah that's fine and
we're<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> loop<00:00:49.260> through<00:00:49.530> our

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we're just going to loop through our

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.150 
we're just going to loop through our
list<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> gems

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.219 

what<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.280> call<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.750> garbage<00:00:55.750> ins<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.229> we're

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
what I call it garbage ins and we're

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.960 
what I call it garbage ins and we're
gonna<00:01:02.320> try<00:01:02.649> Knopf<00:01:03.299> physics<00:01:04.299> pretty<00:01:04.540> much<00:01:05.970> gems

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
gonna try Knopf physics pretty much gems

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.520 
gonna try Knopf physics pretty much gems
that's<00:01:09.000> rigid<00:01:10.000> body<00:01:11.100> okay<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.340> by<00:01:12.520> dot<00:01:13.530> there's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
that's rigid body okay so by dot there's

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:23.219 
that's rigid body okay so by dot there's
your<00:01:14.680> body<00:01:14.890> dot<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:22.210> just<00:01:22.330> toggle<00:01:22.570> you

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
your body dot and we can just toggle you

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.669 
your body dot and we can just toggle you
just<00:01:23.409> say<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:28.170> alright<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.440> can't

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
just say this is alright so we can't

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.050 
just say this is alright so we can't
just<00:01:29.860> toggle<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.369> off<00:01:32.580> we<00:01:33.580> can<00:01:33.700> say<00:01:33.819> that<00:01:33.940> it's

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
just toggle it off we can say that it's

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.620 
just toggle it off we can say that it's
kinematic<00:01:34.569> though<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.060> will<00:01:37.210> turn<00:01:37.390> off

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
kinematic though and that will turn off

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.559 
kinematic though and that will turn off
the<00:01:38.500> kinematics<00:01:38.979> only<00:01:39.250> works<00:01:39.460> between<00:01:40.390> forces

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
the kinematics only works between forces

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.760 
the kinematics only works between forces
so<00:01:43.569> if<00:01:43.780> we're<00:01:43.959> swapping<00:01:44.229> we're<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:44.709> to

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
so if we're swapping we're going to

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.639 
so if we're swapping we're going to
toggle<00:01:44.950> off<00:01:45.310> physics<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.319> to<00:01:50.380> turn<00:01:50.530> it

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
toggle off physics I'm going to turn it

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.960 
toggle off physics I'm going to turn it
off<00:01:50.799> or<00:01:51.299> turn<00:01:52.299> on<00:01:52.330> there<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.289> go<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.759> then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
off or turn on there we go and then

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.139 
off or turn on there we go and then
after<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.360> finish<00:01:59.640> we're<00:02:00.640> going<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.849> turn<00:02:01.030> it

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
after we finish we're going to turn it

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:11.729 
after we finish we're going to turn it
off<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:10.780> they<00:02:10.929> don't<00:02:11.110> bounce<00:02:11.290> or<00:02:11.650> do

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
off and so now they don't bounce or do

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.690 
off and so now they don't bounce or do
any<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.040> weird<00:02:12.250> stuff<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:15.750> alright

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
any of that weird stuff but alright

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.619 
any of that weird stuff but alright
still<00:02:18.700> need<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.090> turn<00:02:19.300> them<00:02:19.480> off

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
still need to like turn them off

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:29.550 
still need to like turn them off
properly<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.720> getting<00:02:23.140> better<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
properly it is getting better and you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.690 
properly it is getting better and you
can<00:02:29.709> see<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:29.950> they're<00:02:30.069> going<00:02:30.190> through<00:02:30.370> each

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
can see that they're going through each

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.130 
can see that they're going through each
other<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:34.720> take<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> look<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:37.140> move

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
other so if we take a look and we move

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.890 
other so if we take a look and we move
they're<00:02:39.099> not<00:02:39.129> moving<00:02:39.459> far<00:02:39.909> enough<00:02:40.120> apart<00:02:40.300> so

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
they're not moving far enough apart so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.720 
they're not moving far enough apart so
that<00:02:41.739> they're<00:02:42.010> still<00:02:42.190> moving<00:02:42.310> through<00:02:42.489> each

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
that they're still moving through each

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:56.630 
that they're still moving through each
other<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.060> I'm<00:02:43.120> gonna<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.480> fix<00:02:43.720> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:11.759 

change<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.000> these<00:02:58.120> values<00:02:58.360> should<00:03:10.769> be

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
change some of these values should be

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:22.199 
change some of these values should be
going<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.340> straight<00:03:12.400> line<00:03:20.940> all<00:03:21.940> right

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
going in a straight line all right

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.309 
going in a straight line all right
so<00:03:22.569> way<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.470> fix<00:03:23.799> this<00:03:24.099> is<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.900> add<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.170> two

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
so way to fix this is to add the two

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:35.630 
so way to fix this is to add the two
together<00:03:26.970> let's<00:03:27.970> subtract<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.510> two<00:03:29.940> okay

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.830 

there<00:03:36.640> we<00:03:36.760> go<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.209> now<00:03:37.269> they<00:03:37.450> rotate<00:03:37.810> around

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
there we go and now they rotate around

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.740 
there we go and now they rotate around
each<00:03:38.200> other<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.790> not<00:03:42.880> too<00:03:43.299> bad<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.540> a

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
each other it's not too bad of a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.780 
each other it's not too bad of a
swapping<00:03:44.140> system<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:47.190> after<00:03:48.190> we<00:03:48.310> swap<00:03:48.610> we

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
swapping system and after we swap we

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.610 
swapping system and after we swap we
need<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> toggle<00:03:49.299> off<00:03:49.660> some<00:03:49.900> other<00:03:50.110> stuff<00:03:50.349> so

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
need to toggle off some other stuff so

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.000 
need to toggle off some other stuff so
let's<00:03:50.739> get<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.069> point<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.709> we<00:03:53.709> finish

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
let's get to that point so we finish

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.370 
let's get to that point so we finish
swapping<00:03:54.220> there<00:03:54.880> turn<00:03:55.090> off<00:03:55.180> swapping<00:03:55.780> they

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
swapping there turn off swapping they

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.240 
swapping there turn off swapping they
say<00:03:56.739> our<00:03:57.489> last<00:03:58.450> gem<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.290> null<00:03:59.530> since<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.069> just

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
say our last gem is null since we just

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.110 
say our last gem is null since we just
swapped<00:04:00.810> current<00:04:01.810> area<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.459> our<00:04:03.489> last<00:04:03.730> gem<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
swapped current area so our last gem is

so<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:42.190> closed<00:04:43.980> it's<00:04:44.980> not<00:04:45.130> matching

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
so it's closed it's not matching

anything yet but it is working on it so

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.280 
anything yet but it is working on it so
you<00:04:57.160> fix<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.820> you<00:04:58.330> shouldn't<00:04:58.630> be<00:04:58.690> using<00:04:58.750> this

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
you fix that you shouldn't be using this

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:08.760 
you fix that you shouldn't be using this
we<00:04:59.620> should<00:04:59.800> be<00:04:59.830> saying<00:05:01.950> toggle<00:05:07.650> since<00:05:08.650> these

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
we should be saying toggle since these

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.409 
we should be saying toggle since these
selectors<00:05:09.220> are<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.520> we<00:05:09.790> should<00:05:09.850> talk<00:05:10.150> with<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
selectors are on we should talk with the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:31.830 
selectors are on we should talk with the
selectors<00:05:10.750> off<00:05:26.070> all<00:05:27.070> right<00:05:27.250> looks<00:05:27.550> better<00:05:30.840> and

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
selectors off all right looks better and

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.190 
selectors off all right looks better and
if<00:05:31.960> one<00:05:32.230> selected<00:05:32.680> it<00:05:32.800> was<00:05:32.919> click<00:05:33.130> over<00:05:33.400> here

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
if one selected it was click over here

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.620 
if one selected it was click over here
but<00:05:35.200> now<00:05:35.230> you<00:05:35.380> can<00:05:35.620> also<00:05:35.910> swap<00:05:36.910> while<00:05:37.330> we're<00:05:37.510> in

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
but now you can also swap while we're in

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.580 
but now you can also swap while we're in
motion<00:05:38.080> with<00:05:38.770> another<00:05:39.100> gem<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:41.380> does

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
motion with another gem and that does

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.520 
motion with another gem and that does
create<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:41.979> large<00:05:44.280> issue<00:05:45.280> as<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.210> can<00:05:46.450> see<00:05:46.660> so

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
create a large issue as you can see so

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.170 
create a large issue as you can see so
we<00:05:47.560> need<00:05:47.890> to<00:05:47.950> prevent<00:05:48.280> clicking<00:05:48.850> when<00:05:49.060> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
we need to prevent clicking when the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.540 
we need to prevent clicking when the
board<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:49.720> moving<00:05:50.320> or<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:51.040> swapping<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:54.160> to<00:05:54.220> do

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
board is moving or is swapping so to do

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.290 
board is moving or is swapping so to do
that<00:05:55.800> we're<00:05:56.800> going<00:05:56.950> to<00:05:57.010> check<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.550> see<00:05:57.580> if<00:05:58.030> it's

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
that we're going to check to see if it's

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:17.280 
that we're going to check to see if it's
swapping<00:05:59.310> is<00:06:00.310> toggled<00:06:15.419> and<00:06:16.419> if<00:06:16.870> it's<00:06:17.020> not

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
swapping is toggled and if it's not

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.320 
swapping is toggled and if it's not
swapping<00:06:17.830> then<00:06:18.430> we'll<00:06:18.610> see<00:06:18.760> that<00:06:18.850> we<00:06:18.940> can<00:06:18.970> swap

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
swapping then we'll see that we can swap

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:30.210 
swapping then we'll see that we can swap
gems<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:27.040> doesn't<00:06:27.490> let<00:06:27.610> us<00:06:27.729> swap<00:06:28.000> until<00:06:29.220> the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
gems so it doesn't let us swap until the

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.980 
gems so it doesn't let us swap until the
gem<00:06:30.490> is<00:06:30.610> swapping<00:06:30.850> but<00:06:31.330> we<00:06:31.450> can<00:06:31.570> still<00:06:31.720> click

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
gem is swapping but we can still click

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:40.400 
gem is swapping but we can still click
because<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:33.100> feel<00:06:33.280> have<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:34.470> put<00:06:35.520> toggling

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:49.020 

okay<00:06:44.130> so<00:06:45.130> now<00:06:47.100> can't<00:06:48.100> click<00:06:48.430> anywhere<00:06:48.820> else

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
okay so now can't click anywhere else

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.640 
okay so now can't click anywhere else
until<00:06:49.810> their<00:06:50.169> gems<00:06:50.350> finish<00:06:50.740> swapping<00:06:52.650> so

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
until their gems finish swapping so

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.980 
until their gems finish swapping so
that's<00:06:53.770> going<00:06:53.919> to<00:06:53.979> be<00:06:54.070> it<00:06:54.190> for<00:06:54.220> this<00:06:54.490> video

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
that's going to be it for this video

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.710 
that's going to be it for this video
thank<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.080> for<00:06:56.169> watching<00:06:56.410> and<00:06:57.330> I<00:06:59.010> will<00:07:00.720> be

thank you for watching and I will be
back<00:07:01.900> later<00:07:01.930> with<00:07:02.260> how<00:07:03.160> to<00:07:03.220> actually<00:07:03.910> do<00:07:04.300> the

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
back later with how to actually do the

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.220 
back later with how to actually do the
matching<00:07:04.600> logic<00:07:05.220> thanks
