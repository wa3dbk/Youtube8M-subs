here's what you'll need first we have a
4-inch<00:00:08.580> styrofoam<00:00:09.210> ball<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:10.320> would<00:00:10.650> tear

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
4-inch styrofoam ball some would tear

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180 
4-inch styrofoam ball some would tear
drops<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.700> woodcraft<00:00:12.240> spose<00:00:12.830> pony<00:00:13.830> beads

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
drops and woodcraft spose pony beads

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
drops and woodcraft spose pony beads
then<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.089> embellishments<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.170> eyes

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
then as embellishments we have our eyes

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.609 
then as embellishments we have our eyes
and<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.279> chenille<00:00:17.580> stem<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> acrylic<00:00:19.140> paint<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and a chenille stem and acrylic paint in

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.370 
and a chenille stem and acrylic paint in
three<00:00:19.890> different<00:00:20.039> colors<00:00:20.720> let's<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:21.930> started

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
three different colors let's get started

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
three different colors let's get started
now<00:00:22.890> our<00:00:23.010> first<00:00:23.250> step<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> cut<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.420> base

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
now our first step is to cut the base

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
now our first step is to cut the base
off<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.849> styrofoam<00:00:26.849> ball<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.390> he

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
off the styrofoam ball so that he

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.259 
off the styrofoam ball so that he
doesn't<00:00:27.750> slide<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.849> using<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
doesn't slide and I'm just using a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
doesn't slide and I'm just using a
plastic<00:00:30.539> knife<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.650> could<00:00:31.830> also<00:00:31.980> rub<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
plastic knife you could also rub this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
plastic knife you could also rub this
along<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> candle<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.480> I'll<00:00:33.630> make<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> easier

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
along a candle and I'll make it easier

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
along a candle and I'll make it easier
to<00:00:34.380> cut<00:00:34.620> I'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> set<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:35.969> aside

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to cut I'm going to set this one aside

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
to cut I'm going to set this one aside
and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.290> that's<00:00:37.469> already<00:00:37.649> cut<00:00:38.360> next

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and I have one that's already cut next

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.660 
and I have one that's already cut next
step<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> paint<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.430> large

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
step is to paint I'm using a large

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.319 
step is to paint I'm using a large
sponge<00:00:42.090> brush<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.969> dab

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
sponge brush and we're going to just dab

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
sponge brush and we're going to just dab
the<00:00:45.629> paint<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> nice

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the paint on we want to have that nice

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
the paint on we want to have that nice
texture<00:00:48.329> II<00:00:48.420> feel<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.899> we're<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.170> actually

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
texture II feel so we're not actually

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.310 
texture II feel so we're not actually
covering<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> styrofoam<00:00:51.110> you're<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
covering the styrofoam you're going to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
covering the styrofoam you're going to
cover<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> entire<00:00:52.949> surface<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
