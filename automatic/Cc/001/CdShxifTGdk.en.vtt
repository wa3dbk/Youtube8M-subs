it's like in the winter in Australia so
I'm<00:01:59.240> not<00:01:59.390> sure<00:01:59.450> how<00:01:59.600> what<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.350> in

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
I'm not sure how what it is in

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.520 
I'm not sure how what it is in
Fahrenheit<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.690> lowest<00:02:02.690> temperature<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.350> get

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
Fahrenheit the lowest temperature we get

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.180 
Fahrenheit the lowest temperature we get
to<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.130> probably<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:08.420> doesn't<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.289> Sydney<00:02:09.979> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
to is probably it doesn't in Sydney it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.370 
to is probably it doesn't in Sydney it
doesn't<00:02:10.550> get<00:02:10.640> very<00:02:10.700> cold<00:02:11.239> it's<00:02:11.569> probably<00:02:12.110> like

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
doesn't get very cold it's probably like

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.710 
doesn't get very cold it's probably like
