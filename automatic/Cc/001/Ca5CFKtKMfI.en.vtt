00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.240
 already back with a delicious cake 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.200
 fear I liked that name parrot cake 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.019
 of coconut no no no the coconut no the coconut no 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.480
 this is great and I feel like 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.400
 little chocolate like that over a little cup of coffee 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.720
 today whom you will say no to it 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.670
 of the ingredients in this recipe 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.670
 write down let's use 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.290
 180 grams of melted butter are 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.290
 as almost two bars four eggs one 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.570
 cup of sugar half a cup of milk 50 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.810
 milliliters of lemon juice a cup and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.450
 average wheat flour 250 grams of 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.180
 grated coconut a spoonful of powders 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.500
 to bake 2 cups of whipping cream 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.610
 6 tablespoons of sugar glass is simple 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.070
 to make this recipe the first thing is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.340
 cream 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.000
 the butter that has to be 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.150
 room temperature together with 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.150
 the eggs then let's put here 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.820
 Almost this egg is this light 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.560
 this is the look does not stay on my part 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.300
 This is a little egg light 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.640
 little chip 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.780
 then to moss cream 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 with sugar 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.340
 and then we had 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.990
 to this to incorporate absolutely everything 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 what is here in the egg after 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.490
 manipulate I know if I recommend them a lot 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.300
 that they wash their hands 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 it is not good to have 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.870
 and have the chicken habitat not raw nor 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.230
 the egg part also in the hands 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.010
 when you're cooking several things not 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.300
 I recommend you let's add the milk 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 the lemon juice 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.650
 here I will mix the powders for 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 bake with the flour 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.190
 and I'm going to add them little by little 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.910
 already this part I love the street all 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.910
 from tan tan tan the flour 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.550
 previously eternity that today a 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.550
 airplane 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.599
 when everything is cannon 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.880
 I am very organized I am very proud 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.820
 from me as it was today's hashtag 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 I'm going to thank you for months and I thank you 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.460
 that they do not throw anything and today I do not ask for chelas 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.450
 it's fine I'm already in balance 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.989
 but I hope you lose one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.740
 not to think let's add the line of 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.410
 coconut 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.850
 look connects my love I've already taken striped 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.260
 and I'm going to take me late 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.700
 they saw nothing 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.090
 it's amazing now the oven needs 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.230
 be preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.950
 there were going to put our cake to 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.950
 to bake 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.750
 Y 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.709
 there you are 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.620
 la la haya is happy to give me when 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.480
 the recipes come out so I get excited 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.920
 so that's always the way 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.380
 reiterating that it 's real time let's go 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.590
 baked 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:58.040
 which we are going to choose is fine 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.420
 then 180 degrees 45 minutes or until 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.980
 let the clean stick come out this 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.750
 of the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.140
 since not all of us are going to make the bitumen is 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.069
 very simple let's put in the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.480
 blender the riding cream 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:22.350
 there is almost up to the cream for 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.350
 to beat 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.770
 with the icing sugar 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:36.970
 Complicated 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:40.750
 and we're going to let the coconut thicken now 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.420
 around coconut there are many myths that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.300
 is scared at night that if not true 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.360
 not really much was said about 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.730
 saturated fat content offered 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.810
 the coconut is true that the coconut is a 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.930
 very interesting source of fats that 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.900
 they benefit the organic functions there 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.450
 debugging as cholesterol and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.490
 that all the veins in the peripheral 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.790
 blood as they decongest in my 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.220
 talk but there is a lot of talk that 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.680
 they contain I tell them this saturated fat 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.140
 that eventually ends with this part 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.270
 veins and arteries and elevate the 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.270
 cholesterol level I am of the idea is 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.000
 I say a vegetable can not be so 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.670
 harmful that is one and the other is that their 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.810
 Advantages are huge if you exercise 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.080
 for example in your house 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.300
 you go out to run talk there's nothing better 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.250
 to hydrate yourself that coconut water is 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.130
 an incredible incredible source of 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.820
 protein what will allow you 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.380
 recover after exercise 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.690
 always after the exercise we hurt 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.910
 the muscles the coconut water can 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.250
 help mitigate that pain and also 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.169
 can you help with potassium at all 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.659
 to rehydrate tea because you do not have 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.669
 losses and do not take these this 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.520
 drinks that they sell that say that 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.099
 they moisturize because it's actually hydrated 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.129
 then trust the coconut if they are in 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.020
 the beaches and on the deserted islands do not 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.389
 if it is what the castaway arrives at 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.719
 save your thirst is for something is not 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.719
 free
