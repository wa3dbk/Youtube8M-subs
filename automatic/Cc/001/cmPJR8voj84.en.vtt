00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
well originally I was gonna fill this

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.800 
well originally I was gonna fill this
thing<00:00:01.979> up<00:00:02.340> with<00:00:02.399> outlets<00:00:02.970> all<00:00:03.179> over<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.570> place

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
thing up with outlets all over the place

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.450 
thing up with outlets all over the place
I<00:00:04.080> started<00:00:04.440> thinking<00:00:04.799> about<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.069> there's<00:00:05.310> only

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I started thinking about it there's only

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.730 
I started thinking about it there's only
a<00:00:05.580> six<00:00:05.879> Bay<00:00:06.089> cab<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:06.839> how<00:00:06.990> much<00:00:07.170> stuff<00:00:07.470> am<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
a six Bay cab but how much stuff am I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.009 
a six Bay cab but how much stuff am I
really<00:00:08.160> gonna<00:00:08.460> plug<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.480> probably

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
really gonna plug in in here probably

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.230 
really gonna plug in in here probably
not<00:00:10.380> much<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.429> decided<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
not much so what I decided to do is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.030 
not much so what I decided to do is
instead<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.719> planning<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.500> looked<00:00:13.889> around

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
instead of planning that I looked around

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.400 
instead of planning that I looked around
see<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> actually<00:00:14.940> had<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.509> material<00:00:16.049> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
see what I actually had in material and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.849 
see what I actually had in material and
actually<00:00:16.859> found<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.220> quad<00:00:17.430> box<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:18.300> about<00:00:18.480> now

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
actually found a quad box from about now

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.230 
actually found a quad box from about now
and<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.220> looks<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.760> old<00:00:20.910> single

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and this looks like an old single

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.859 
and this looks like an old single
receptacle<00:00:22.020> box<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.619> they'll<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.189> three<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
receptacle box so they'll be three and I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320 
receptacle box so they'll be three and I
just<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.619> add<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.369> roll<00:00:26.699> wire<00:00:27.000> laying

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
just have to go add a roll wire laying

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
just have to go add a roll wire laying
around<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> stock<00:00:28.289> stuff<00:00:29.130> cuz<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
around I like the stock stuff cuz you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
around I like the stock stuff cuz you
never<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.060> you're<00:00:30.240> gonna<00:00:30.359> build<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
never know what you're gonna build so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.330 
never know what you're gonna build so
this<00:00:31.590> shouldn't<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:31.920> long

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this shouldn't take long

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:59.140 
this shouldn't take long
I'm<00:00:32.579> gonna<00:00:32.759> start<00:00:33.000> wiring<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.840> up

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.370 

because<00:01:00.150> this<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.330> was<00:01:00.630> originally<00:01:00.780> framed

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
because this thing was originally framed

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.800 
because this thing was originally framed
out<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.860> be<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> chicken<00:01:02.400> coop<00:01:02.700> I'm<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.660> gonna

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
out to be a chicken coop I'm not gonna

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.870 
out to be a chicken coop I'm not gonna
drill<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> million<00:01:04.620> holes<00:01:04.830> run<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.370> wiring<00:01:05.550> I'm

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
drill a million holes run the wiring I'm

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
drill a million holes run the wiring I'm
gonna<00:01:06.030> run<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> wire<00:01:06.510> underneath<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> I'm

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
gonna run the wire underneath so I'm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
gonna run the wire underneath so I'm
making<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> small<00:01:08.310> slit<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
making a small slit right here so if the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
making a small slit right here so if the
wiring<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.830> actually<00:01:11.250> sit<00:01:11.460> flush<00:01:11.790> inside<00:01:12.300> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
wiring can actually sit flush inside the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:23.030 
wiring can actually sit flush inside the
side

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.650 

now<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.580> I've<00:01:23.700> done<00:01:23.730> is<00:01:24.180> they've<00:01:24.330> looped

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
now what I've done is they've looped

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.260 
now what I've done is they've looped
this<00:01:25.020> wire<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.890> outlet<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.790> outlet

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this wire from this outlet to the outlet

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
this wire from this outlet to the outlet
on<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> other<00:01:27.720> side<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
on the other side here and this is the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.430 
on the other side here and this is the
one<00:01:29.760> that's<00:01:29.910> gonna<00:01:30.120> be<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.540> main<00:01:30.720> feed<00:01:31.200> that's

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
one that's gonna be the main feed that's

00:01:31.440 --> 00:04:45.740 
one that's gonna be the main feed that's
gonna<00:01:31.650> feed<00:01:31.980> both<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.520> them

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.930 

well<00:04:46.750> technically<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.680> building<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:48.460> plugged

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
well technically the building is plugged

00:04:48.940 --> 00:05:00.110 
well technically the building is plugged
in<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.900> let's<00:04:50.080> see<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:50.410> our<00:04:50.560> olives<00:04:51.070> work<00:04:55.860> works

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.820 

on<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.390> sides<00:05:01.720> power<00:05:02.050> they<00:05:02.350> got<00:05:02.500> one<00:05:02.800> more

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
on that sides power they got one more

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.890 
on that sides power they got one more
down<00:05:03.280> here<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:04.000> I'm<00:05:04.180> sure<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.510> hear<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:06.900> we
