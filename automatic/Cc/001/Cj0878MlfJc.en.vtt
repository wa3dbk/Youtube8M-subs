00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.939
 Switzerland is welcome to another video by its 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.130
 introduce new role 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.329
 I have the memories 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.329
 or see for yourself 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:18.170
 The margin gold paid at 1 15 EUR 37 4 costs included but is one 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.659
 Selection so that flows for the micro in Melle 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.269
 although that looks like Enzo 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.460
 for the design and protection from other vehicles and Reinhild too 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.979
 the display 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.289
 So I think the Euro 2012 should invest quietly 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.570
 yes, it looks more from the outside 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.180
 Wish hydrogen 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.440
 with a white stripe 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 There are a few trees around the strips 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.050
 Kammermeier pictures I just say that 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.610
 And this fit but very well that he must specify when buying what a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.790
 Owns mobile phone or smartphone 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.240
 and once completely specified iPhone 4 and the password possible 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.190
 So perfect German citizen is not going to sit 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.360
 and why do I have such a gap? 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.850
 Veneers meanwhile pretty important just not a plastic tree 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.410
 To get the building out of the bag 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 and that's just the way to design the iPhone 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.990
 Keeping Alba and not only has to have funny senses Cologne-Bonn 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.520
 Image delete got war the action tree was Kristen Stewart 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 together almost three out of four 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 thus the individual problems 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 botched so missed Marcel 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.540
 and cities with Bank Barclays will not fit in anymore 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.270
 Unless that was going to improve, Carpenters are full 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.200
 satisfied dog 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.510
 yes not always what was not nice talk but also many many 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.770
 Years of all sorts of colors and fabrics also made of leather 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.060
 and i may be missing a little bit the shipping will be about a week 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 lasted 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.659
 on the episode last many more videos and pictures we see here and 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.080
 are not afraid to have their reason was added as a friend 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.840
 and I would say that was a show
