think<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.530> probably<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.860> they're<00:00:14.009> going

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
think this is probably so they're going

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.440 
think this is probably so they're going
to<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.549> careful<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.000> based<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.360> how

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to be really careful with based on how

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.820 
to be really careful with based on how
