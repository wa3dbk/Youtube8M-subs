tower I don't know when I saw the first
time<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.899> immediate<00:00:37.440> reaction<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:38.040> lord<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
time my immediate reaction was lord of

time my immediate reaction was lord of
the<00:00:38.910> rings<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.899> no<00:00:40.079> doubt<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the rings there is no doubt that this

the rings there is no doubt that this
area<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> very<00:00:41.600> inspired<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.230> anyway<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
area is very inspired by that anyway I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
part of this surveying tripod is a lens

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.850 
part of this surveying tripod is a lens
and<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> move<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> direction

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
now this lens and the blinking light is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.009 
now this lens and the blinking light is
the<00:02:16.709> indicator<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.400> where<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.239> artifact<00:02:18.780> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
the indicator of where the artifact is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.589 
the indicator of where the artifact is
located<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.670> matter<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.060> moving

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
located so it's just a matter of moving

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.380 
located so it's just a matter of moving
towards<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.470> finding<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.269> can

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
towards you finding it and this you can

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.559 
towards you finding it and this you can
do<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:24.989> times<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.590> every<00:02:26.430> dig<00:02:26.819> site<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
do three times of every dig site that

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.539 
do three times of every dig site that
are<00:02:27.720> always<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.379> minimum<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.890> three<00:02:29.220> fragments

around<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:43.079> store<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.919> in<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.129> back

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
around or store them in your back

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.610 
around or store them in your back
because<00:03:44.760> these<00:03:44.940> take<00:03:45.299> up<00:03:45.510> backspace<00:03:46.290> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
because these take up backspace the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.559 
because these take up backspace the
normal<00:03:46.980> fragment<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.609> you're<00:03:47.879> getting<00:03:48.060> from

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
normal fragment that you're getting from

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.659 
normal fragment that you're getting from
dig<00:03:48.989> site<00:03:49.260> all<00:03:49.470> around<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> world<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.430> not

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
dig site all around the world do not

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.420 
dig site all around the world do not
pick<00:03:50.970> up<00:03:51.000> backspace<00:03:51.720> but<00:03:52.379> these<00:03:52.590> rune<00:03:53.099> stones

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
pick up backspace but these rune stones

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.089 
pick up backspace but these rune stones
do<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.180> make<00:03:54.359> sure<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:54.989> space<00:03:55.500> for<00:03:55.859> them

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
do so make sure you have space for them

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.189 
do so make sure you have space for them
somewhere<00:03:56.699> now<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.359> want<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.780> give<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:57.959> this

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
little tip if you haven't started

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.759 
little tip if you haven't started
archaeology<00:04:00.569> yet<00:04:00.810> or<00:04:01.079> at<00:04:01.319> least<00:04:01.349> if<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
archaeology yet or at least if you

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.589 
archaeology yet or at least if you
hadn't<00:04:02.040> gotten<00:04:02.280> enough<00:04:02.549> fragment<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.299> solve

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
hadn't gotten enough fragment to solve

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.689 
hadn't gotten enough fragment to solve
anything<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.230> would<00:04:04.500> recommend<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
anything I would recommend that you

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.939 
anything I would recommend that you
before<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.359> solve<00:04:06.690> anything<00:04:06.870> keep<00:04:07.560> finding

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
before you solve anything keep finding

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.729 
before you solve anything keep finding
dig<00:04:08.340> sites<00:04:08.669> finding<00:04:09.419> fragments<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.199> store

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
dig sites finding fragments and store

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.789 
dig sites finding fragments and store
them<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.669> you<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.540> level

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
them because you are going to level

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.039 
them because you are going to level
archaeology<00:04:13.799> from<00:04:13.980> 1<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.760> 75<00:04:15.419> you're<00:04:15.870> gonna

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
archaeology from 1 to 75 you're gonna

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.259 
archaeology from 1 to 75 you're gonna
get<00:04:16.320> one<00:04:16.650> skill<00:04:16.949> point<00:04:17.250> each<00:04:17.430> time<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:18.000> find

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
get one skill point each time you find

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.909 
get one skill point each time you find
fragment<00:04:18.870> from<00:04:19.410> about<00:04:20.010> level<00:04:20.430> 75<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.719> 100<00:04:22.710> it's

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
fragment from about level 75 to 100 it's

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.730 
fragment from about level 75 to 100 it's
going<00:04:23.219> to<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.520> green<00:04:24.180> which<00:04:24.510> means

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
going to be green which means

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.589 
going to be green which means
get<00:04:25.889> one<00:04:26.190> every<00:04:26.460> time<00:04:26.759> but<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.300> will<00:04:27.449> still

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
get one every time but you will still

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.930 
get one every time but you will still
gain<00:04:28.169> skill<00:04:28.530> levels<00:04:28.919> at<00:04:29.130> least<00:04:29.520> until<00:04:29.849> you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
gain skill levels at least until you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.330 
gain skill levels at least until you
reach<00:04:30.120> level<00:04:30.150> 100<00:04:30.750> then<00:04:31.620> at<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.949> point<00:04:32.009> you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
reach level 100 then at that point you

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.279 
reach level 100 then at that point you
are<00:04:32.580> only<00:04:32.819> going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.330> get<00:04:33.419> skill<00:04:33.690> points<00:04:34.050> every

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
are only going to get skill points every

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.870 
are only going to get skill points every
time<00:04:34.319> you<00:04:34.650> solve<00:04:34.949> something<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.759> they've

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
time you solve something and they've

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.879 
time you solve something and they've
give<00:04:36.150> five<00:04:36.509> points<00:04:36.539> no<00:04:37.169> matter<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:37.770> a

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
give five points no matter if it's a

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.890 
give five points no matter if it's a
common<00:04:38.340> or<00:04:38.490> if<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:38.759> an<00:04:38.880> epic<00:04:39.180> item<00:04:39.569> they<00:04:39.720> give

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
common or if it's an epic item they give

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.600 
common or if it's an epic item they give
you<00:04:39.960> five<00:04:40.229> skill<00:04:40.500> points<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.099> what<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.400> want

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
you five skill points so what you want

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.999 
you five skill points so what you want
to<00:04:41.699> do<00:04:41.819> at<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.090> point<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.960> start<00:04:43.710> solving

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
to do at that point is start solving

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.040 
to do at that point is start solving
that<00:04:44.520> will<00:04:44.880> at<00:04:45.090> least<00:04:45.240> give<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.720> little<00:04:45.900> bit

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
that will at least give you a little bit

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.650 
that will at least give you a little bit
of<00:04:46.139> boost<00:04:46.319> I<00:04:46.500> didn't<00:04:46.889> do<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.550> I'm<00:04:48.090> kind

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
of boost I didn't do that and I'm kind

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.379 
of boost I didn't do that and I'm kind
of<00:04:48.780> kicking<00:04:49.169> myself<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.949> I<00:04:49.979> didn't<00:04:50.400> I'm<00:04:51.150> also

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
of kicking myself that I didn't I'm also

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.640 
of kicking myself that I didn't I'm also
going<00:04:51.569> to<00:04:51.630> make<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:51.900> short<00:04:52.199> list<00:04:52.440> you'll<00:04:52.620> see

gonna<00:04:55.590> learn<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.460> in<00:04:56.819> archaeology<00:04:57.509> at<00:04:57.750> what

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
gonna learn about in archaeology at what

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.960 
gonna learn about in archaeology at what
skill<00:04:58.259> level<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.919> all<00:04:59.069> I<00:04:59.099> can<00:04:59.340> say<00:04:59.520> now<00:04:59.759> is
