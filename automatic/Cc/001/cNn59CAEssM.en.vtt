00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
them and just cut it in half this looks

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880 
them and just cut it in half this looks
like<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.000> upper<00:02:51.300> half<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.870> speaker<00:02:52.410> it's

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
like the upper half of that speaker it's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.830 
like the upper half of that speaker it's
a<00:02:53.070> rather<00:02:53.370> unusual<00:02:53.670> design<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.540> certainly

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
a rather unusual design and certainly

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080 
a rather unusual design and certainly
one<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.230> first<00:02:55.380> speakers<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.910> first

speaker from Super tooth that we've seen
that<00:02:58.620> has<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> handle<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.030> which<00:03:00.150> makes<00:03:00.300> it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
that has a handle in it which makes it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.090 
that has a handle in it which makes it
really<00:03:00.480> perfect<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.410> warm<00:03:01.620> weather<00:03:01.830> now

you<00:03:11.130> actually<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> speaker<00:03:12.210> that<00:03:12.630> sounds

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you actually get a speaker that sounds

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.860 
you actually get a speaker that sounds
pretty<00:03:13.350> darn<00:03:13.680> good<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.250> was<00:03:14.910> really<00:03:15.330> surprised

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
pretty darn good I was really surprised

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.840 
pretty darn good I was really surprised
by<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.290> quality<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.220> sound<00:03:17.370> coming<00:03:17.670> from

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
by the quality of the sound coming from

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.340 
by the quality of the sound coming from
this<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.240> not<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> compete<00:03:19.110> with<00:03:19.320> a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this it's not going to compete with a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.320 
this it's not going to compete with a
much<00:03:19.620> bigger<00:03:19.890> much<00:03:20.220> more<00:03:20.430> expensive<00:03:20.730> speaker

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
much bigger much more expensive speaker

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.000 
much bigger much more expensive speaker
but<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.470> does<00:03:22.830> hold<00:03:23.280> its<00:03:23.550> own<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.360> for

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
but it really does hold its own and for

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.280 
but it really does hold its own and for
$49<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.310> an<00:03:26.460> absolute<00:03:27.000> bargain<00:03:27.330> when<00:03:28.170> you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
$49 it's an absolute bargain when you

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.860 
$49 it's an absolute bargain when you
push<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.920> upper<00:03:29.610> volumes<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.660> does

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
push it to the upper volumes it does

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.190 
push it to the upper volumes it does
distort<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.410> little<00:03:31.590> bit<00:03:31.740> but<00:03:32.340> when<00:03:32.670> you're<00:03:32.850> at

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
distort a little bit but when you're at

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.140 
distort a little bit but when you're at
3/4<00:03:34.200> or<00:03:34.380> below<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:35.040> sounds<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:35.850> good

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
3/4 or below it sounds really good

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.210 
3/4 or below it sounds really good
there's<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.600> plenty<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.140> bass<00:03:37.320> not<00:03:37.830> too<00:03:38.040> much

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
there's a plenty of bass not too much

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
there's a plenty of bass not too much
but<00:03:38.370> plenty<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.760> bass<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.660> certainly<00:03:40.050> does

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
but plenty of bass and it certainly does

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.250 
but plenty of bass and it certainly does
not<00:03:40.290> sound<00:03:40.710> like<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.070> $49<00:03:41.970> speaker<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.080> you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
not sound like a $49 speaker so if you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.800 
not sound like a $49 speaker so if you
are<00:03:43.500> looking<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> speaker<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.270> take<00:03:45.510> with
