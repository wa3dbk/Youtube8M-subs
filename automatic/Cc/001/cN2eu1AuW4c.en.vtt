 Hello everyone Hello how are you

 welcome back to the channel today I come 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.809
 with a video of products that do not 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.670
 I would buy again unfortunately and it is 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.470
 that has accumulated some little things of the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.110
 which of which I want to talk to you and 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 I want to explain why I would not return them 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.700
 to buy and why I have been disappointed 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.290
 so nothing if you want to see them then 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.849
 you know stay with me in the first place 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.489
 I am going to talk to you about two bases of 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.649
 makeup that I have been disappointed 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.239
 quite the first one is the stay 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.120
 mascara mad that is a base of 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.489
 makeup that according to specify the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.140
 container has light texture and to put 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.089
 control the brightness this is the basis of 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.850
 makeup and now I have in the tone 103 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.289
 starboard and and as you see is presented in a 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 plastic tube a foundation 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.879
 in texture mousse I'm not for nothing 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.699
 according to what he puts in the container 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.129
 that it is light is quite heavy and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.159
 it is also that it is not homogeneous in the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.499
 skin dries up very much 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.999
 very much I have not got to check if 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.770
 really endures all day without 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.770
 shines because according to I 've put it on me 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.719
 I had to take because I will dry 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.479
 and that I have skin right now 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.369
 rather mixed but it is impossible 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.920
 use this base at least in my 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.950
 skin I do not know if you have tried it 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.360
 with is of please in comments what 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.299
 It has seemed to you if it has happened to you 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.579
 same as me or whatever it was quite 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.030
 cheap I think it cost me about five or 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.469
 six euros or something like that and well then this 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.509
 is what I tell you about this base of 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.789
 makeup and makeup foundation that 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.360
 I was also disappointed is the famous 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.360
 you kill sea flower I have it in the tone 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.439
 301 shop veis is a foundation 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.659
 of medium-high coverage with vitamin e 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.369
 but it is not free of oils is not what 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.200
 it happens to me with this makeup base and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.340
 I think it's something that I already told you in the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.319
 hall where I teach it is that it does not last me 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.420
 practically nothing after an hour or two 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.549
 hours already I have the whole face full of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.110
 shines and what I always soil 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.610
 modify this base powder 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.160
 makeup but I can not stand 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.869
 practically nothing I imagine that it will be 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.359
 because it contains oils because good is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 something that does not happen to me with almost no 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.700
 base 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.650
 I have for example the photo-finish of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.560
 if you hold me intact for 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.600
 hours and hours and hours however this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520
 which specifies that it is mate lasts me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.560
 very little and I get many bright 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.600
 with her another thing that I do not like about 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.630
 these foundation are the shades 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.750
 I see them all too roses this 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.850
 example is the beige soft that is supposed 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.090
 that it should be beige because it's not very 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.320
 pink too but good apart from what 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.000
 of the tone that is something that can be 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.709
 fix putting a town even 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.510
 mixing the makeup base the theme 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.390
 of duration is something that has not 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 liked nothing and that's why I will not repeat with 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.890
 she and I did not pick her the third and last 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.480
 makeup product that I teach in 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.580
 this video is a product that I've already 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.170
 taught in previous videos I 've already 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.269
 commented that I do not like it so 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.570
 I will not roll too is 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.630
 the lip amp amp framers read from it is a 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.910
 first lipstick that on the one hand has a 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.760
 sort of concealer and on the other side 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.250
 has a product of these that contribute 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 volume to the lip good 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.930
 I already told you that the corrector is 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.760
 a horrible tone and that the part that 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.390
 brings volume to me personally I do not 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.250
 what brings it then good to me is a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.500
 product that I did not like what 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
 I'm there , laughing dead in the drawer like this 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.920
 I do not recommend it and obviously not what 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.110
 would buy again let's be now 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.959
 treatment products and I continue with 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.160
 the signature and I now teach you the winker 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:47.090
 rifai nerf is a product that is supposed 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.070
 that attenuates expression lines but 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.380
 I have tried several times and I have not 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.330
 noticed nothing at all I've tried it on 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.690
 he has tried it on my mother and we have not 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.940
 noticed that the lines that are 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.290
 blur or anything like that 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.270
 It is a product that comes with a 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.239
 rubber applicator with a little circle in the 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.090
 half we rotate here and the liquid comes out 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.670
 the top but good 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.860
 we the liquid also has a smell 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.519
 quite strange and good because it's a 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.019
 product that does nothing or at least 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.269
 I have not noticed that I do anything I do not know if 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.430
 have you tried it or have you heard any 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.040
 I review about the truth is that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.080
 that I heard were good reviews but I 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.360
 I've tried it really I have not seen that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.699
 work so that's why I do not 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.590
 I would buy another product from 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.970
 treatment that I would not buy again and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.850
 I'm looking for an alternative 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.970
 because I really do not know what they use are 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.620
 the waxes the cold wax in bands of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.780
 dellys 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.160
 This facial was good for hair removal 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.620
 Facial comes like that and well they are strips 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.990
 of wax that must be heated with the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.840
 palm of the hands separate to apply it and 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.960
 throw him like any wax because now 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.129
 I like it because it irritates me too much and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.369
 also 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.379
 I get acne a lot acne I get 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:11.719
 like white shins all over the area 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:14.249
 of the upper lip and that is horrible 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.919
 besides that it irritates me a lot the area and 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.860
 I tell you then I'm the next 3 or 4 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.469
 days with the whole area full of granites 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.319
 Nagore explained to me that from here he 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.779
 I send a kiss if you are not seeing what is 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.860
 because good to be cold wax does not open the 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:34.080
 by then the hair comes out without being 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.629
 erased the open and that forum is 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.159
 infects or something like that so I understood not 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.309
 he corrects me I fell in love without him being like that 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.169
 so well I would not buy them again 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.449
 and please if you know any alternative 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.139
 for facial hair removal that will not be 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.610
 those of the bands of cold wax then I 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.709
 I would appreciate it if you leave it on 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.929
 comments and the sixth and last product 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.929
 that I am going to teach you in this video is 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:59.519
 this chlorine shampoo that you also 

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:01.019
 speak in the video of the fall of 

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:04.319
 hair that I will leave you also in the 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:07.199
 information box and well it is a 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.110
 preventive shampoo for the fall I think that 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.950
 prevent 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.650
 and stimulates the follicle for the 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.810
 good hair growth because it is a 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.700
 shampoo that to me from the first moment 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.950
 that I used it produced a lot 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.320
 dandruff I think some of you 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.870
 He said that oil mixed with 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.730
 Tea tree to keep me from getting out 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.000
 Dandruff and I were cameras leather 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.230
 correct me if it's not like that and 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.940
 well my mother for example is 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.160
 using and doing pretty well but to 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.590
 it is that it produces a lot of flake 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.840
 I lie then well I am now with the 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.390

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.890
 the truth quite well and good this in 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.430
 I would not buy it again because 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.440
 It is also quite expensive and good because that 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.330
 is what I tell you about this shampoo and 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.160
