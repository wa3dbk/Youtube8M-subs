00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
with a brush the reason for this is that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
with a brush the reason for this is that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
your skin let's say for example my tip

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.480 
your skin let's say for example my tip
of<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:34.290> finger<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> blackhead<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.430> you

of my finger is a blackhead you know you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.390 
of my finger is a blackhead you know you
just<00:01:36.079> exfoliate<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> while<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.860> still

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
just exfoliate for a while it's still

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.390 
just exfoliate for a while it's still
going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.939> hard<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.400> can

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
going to be really hard but if you can

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
going to be really hard but if you can
exploit<00:01:41.729> longer<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.810> won't<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.229> most

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
exploit longer it it won't come out most

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.510 
exploit longer it it won't come out most
likely<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.909> it'll<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.210> loosened<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
likely but it'll be loosened so that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
likely but it'll be loosened so that
when<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> extract<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.659> easier

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
when you extract is going to be easier

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.520 
when you extract is going to be easier
and<00:01:49.829> basically<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.439> to

now if you're doing facials on yourself
the<00:04:08.380> best<00:04:08.680> time<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.730> extract<00:04:10.060> would<00:04:10.750> be<00:04:10.990> in<00:04:11.950> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
the best time to extract would be in the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.680 
the best time to extract would be in the
day<00:04:12.280> time<00:04:12.490> where<00:04:12.760> there's<00:04:12.940> sunlight<00:04:13.270> because

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
I find out what sunlight

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.060 
I find out what sunlight
the<00:04:15.629> easiest<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.289> yourself<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.919> you're

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
the easiest to see yourself if you're

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.379 
the easiest to see yourself if you're
getting<00:04:17.190> someone<00:04:17.699> else<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.209> you
