distraction we all run into it on an

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
distraction we all run into it on an
ongoing<00:00:20.189> basis<00:00:20.850> you're<00:00:21.330> working<00:00:21.630> away<00:00:21.720> on

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810

ongoing basis you're working away on
something<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.380> run<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:23.070> bit<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
something you run into a little bit of a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.810 
something you run into a little bit of a
roadblock

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
roadblock

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
roadblock
you<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.269> can't<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.689> past<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.410> instead<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you just can't get past it so instead of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040 
you just can't get past it so instead of
struggling<00:00:26.369> through<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.240> soldiering<00:00:27.930> on

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
struggling through it and soldiering on

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
struggling through it and soldiering on
you<00:00:28.830> check<00:00:29.070> Facebook<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.929> need

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
you check Facebook because you just need

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.700 
you check Facebook because you just need
a<00:00:31.109> little<00:00:31.260> break

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
a little break

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870 
a little break
but<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> takes<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.579> off<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
but then that takes you off on a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.340 
but then that takes you off on a
complete<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.480> tangent<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.960> then

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
complete different tangent and then

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.720 
complete different tangent and then
getting<00:00:34.620> back<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> momentum<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
getting back into the momentum of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
getting back into the momentum of
concentrating<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> task<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:36.930> hand<00:00:36.960> well

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
concentrating on the task at hand well

concentrating on the task at hand well
typically<00:00:38.129> speaking<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.059> more<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> a

typically speaking that is more of a
struggle<00:00:39.960> than<00:00:40.110> ever<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.890> lose<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.309> massive

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
struggle than ever and we lose a massive

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
struggle than ever and we lose a massive
amount<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.210> productivity<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.320> result<00:00:43.800> now

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
amount of productivity as a result now

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.590 
amount of productivity as a result now
we've<00:00:44.309> looked<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.550> some<00:00:44.700> great<00:00:44.969> tools<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we've looked at some great tools in the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
we've looked at some great tools in the
past<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.200> helped<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.309> I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
past that helped the one that I'm

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
past that helped the one that I'm
thinking<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.760> 3030<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.170> tasks<00:00:49.559> timer<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
thinking of 3030 the tasks timer that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 
thinking of 3030 the tasks timer that
works<00:00:50.309> similar<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.090> Pomodoro<00:00:51.690> Technique

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

we<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.820> emails<00:01:06.420> coming<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.950> say<00:01:08.100> when

we have emails coming in as I say when

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
we have emails coming in as I say when
we<00:01:08.369> hit<00:01:08.460> roadblocks<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.119> tend<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.689> for

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
we hit roadblocks we tend to look for

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.120 
we hit roadblocks we tend to look for
distractions<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> point<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.010> because

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
distractions at that point there because

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
distractions at that point there because
we're<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.780> cook<00:01:12.990> it's

we're it's just a way that we cook it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
we're it's just a way that we cook it's
a<00:01:13.229> coping<00:01:13.409> mechanism<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> work

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a coping mechanism so we have to work

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.380 
a coping mechanism so we have to work
our<00:01:15.479> way<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:15.770> those<00:01:16.770> issues<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.729> some

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
our way through those issues now some

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.960 
our way through those issues now some
people<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:19.320> very<00:01:19.560> drastic<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.310> disconnect

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
people go very drastic they disconnect

completely<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.960> periods<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.770> think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
completely for periods of time I think

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
completely for periods of time I think
those<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.640> fairly<00:01:29.820> drastic<00:01:30.240> measures<00:01:30.810> there

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
those are fairly drastic measures there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
those are fairly drastic measures there
are<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> in-between<00:01:32.130> steps<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
are some kind of in-between steps that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
are some kind of in-between steps that
one<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.479> look<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.500> ones<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
one could look at and the ones that I

one could look at and the ones that I
like<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.640> apps<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.299> basically

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
like are the apps that basically

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
like are the apps that basically
eliminate<00:01:37.650> distraction<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> visual<00:01:38.850> level

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
eliminate distraction at a visual level

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
word processors that I want to look at

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
word processors that I want to look at
actually<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> today<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.270> very

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

actually to today that to take two very
different<00:01:45.840> approaches<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> writing<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
different approaches to that writing is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.429 
different approaches to that writing is
the<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> typically<00:01:48.899> need<00:01:49.229> our

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the thing that we typically need our

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
the thing that we typically need our
most<00:01:49.710> concentration<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.579> we're<00:01:50.700> doing<00:01:50.970> when

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
most concentration when we're doing when

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
most concentration when we're doing when
we're<00:01:51.299> come<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:51.810> we're<00:01:51.960> composing<00:01:52.590> letters

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
we're come when we're composing letters

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
we're come when we're composing letters

when we're writing proposals when if

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
when we're writing proposals when if
we're<00:01:55.229> writing<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.590> book<00:01:55.740> any<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> those<00:01:56.189> tasks

we're writing a book any of those tasks

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
we're writing a book any of those tasks
we<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.170> able<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> focus<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
we really like to be able to focus and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
we really like to be able to focus and
concentrate<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.180> dealing<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> word

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
