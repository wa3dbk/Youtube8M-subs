00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
my opinion I don't know I was skeptical

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
my opinion I don't know I was skeptical
first<00:01:16.380> between<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> size<00:01:17.250> difference<00:01:17.490> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
first between the size difference I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.770 
first between the size difference I
didn't<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> much

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
didn't think it would be that much

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
didn't think it would be that much
different<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.770> again<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> same

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
different but then again it's the same

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.859 
different but then again it's the same

experience I guess but yeah the one
notice<00:02:39.340> what's<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.670> thing<00:02:39.910> one<00:02:40.420> noticeable

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
notice what's the thing one noticeable

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.770 
notice what's the thing one noticeable
thing<00:02:41.170> about<00:02:41.980> these<00:02:42.340> two<00:02:42.610> devices<00:02:42.850> other<00:02:43.540> than

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
thing about these two devices other than

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.380 
thing about these two devices other than
the<00:02:43.900> screen<00:02:44.170> size<00:02:44.320> for<00:02:44.800> me<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.390> pixel

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the screen size for me is the pixel

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.350 
the screen size for me is the pixel
density<00:02:46.810> now<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.380> forget<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.519> resolution<00:02:49.239> on

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
density now I forget the resolution on

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.630 
density now I forget the resolution on
the<00:02:49.540> kindle<00:02:49.959> fire<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.640> better

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
the kindle fire but and but the better

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.000 
the kindle fire but and but the better
on<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.209> note<00:02:58.420> 8.0<00:02:58.720> would<00:02:59.560> only<00:02:59.680> think<00:02:59.800> about

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
on the note 8.0 would only think about

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.970 
on the note 8.0 would only think about
that<00:03:00.340> though<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:01.260> compared<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.320> other<00:03:02.560> devices

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
that though is compared to other devices

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.059 
that though is compared to other devices
this<00:03:03.820> isn't<00:03:04.239> even<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.480> best<00:03:04.630> out<00:03:05.110> there<00:03:05.140> but

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
this isn't even the best out there but

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.940 
this isn't even the best out there but
it's<00:03:06.220> noticeably<00:03:06.790> better<00:03:07.080> which<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.440> good

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
it's noticeably better which is as good

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400 
it's noticeably better which is as good
i<00:03:09.010> mean<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.030> text<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.600> kindle<00:03:11.200> fire

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
i mean the text on the kindle fire

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
can you can practically see the pixels

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.979 
can you can practically see the pixels
from<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.400> camera<00:03:28.170> whereas<00:03:31.799> can't<00:03:32.799> really

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
seated pixels as easily on the node

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.710 
seated pixels as easily on the node
appointment<00:03:38.260> but<00:03:38.549> either<00:03:39.549> way<00:03:39.850> i<00:03:40.150> mean<00:03:40.510> they

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
don't they're not the highest pixel

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.960 
don't they're not the highest pixel
densities<00:03:42.579> displays<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.390> there<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.769> that's

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
densities displays out there but that's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.449 
densities displays out there but that's
not<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.329> reason<00:03:46.570> why<00:03:46.810> I've<00:03:47.019> got<00:03:47.860> you

smartphone which I will be because i'm

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.280 
smartphone which I will be because i'm
getting<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.220> HTC<00:03:57.670> One<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:58.630> yeah<00:03:59.130> so<00:04:00.130> yeah

another<00:04:02.290> noticeable<00:04:02.859> difference<00:04:03.250> between

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
another noticeable difference between

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.180 
another noticeable difference between
these<00:04:03.850> two<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.359> obviously<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.260> performance

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
these two is obviously the performance

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.449 
these two is obviously the performance
differences<00:04:06.700> now<00:04:07.680> because<00:04:08.680> this<00:04:09.070> is<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
differences now because this is a

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.880 
differences now because this is a
quad-core<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.959> dual-core<00:04:11.380> especially

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
quad-core this is a dual-core especially

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.539 
quad-core this is a dual-core especially
like<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:13.660> not<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.530> dual-core<00:04:14.980> it's<00:04:15.340> a

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
like it's not just a dual-core it's a

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.190 
like it's not just a dual-core it's a
very<00:04:15.850> really<00:04:16.419> dual<00:04:16.600> core

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
very really dual core

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.230 
very really dual core
like<00:04:17.320> I<00:04:17.560> don't<00:04:17.860> remember<00:04:18.280> when<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.970> kindle

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
like I don't remember when the kindle

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.060 
like I don't remember when the kindle
fire<00:04:19.390> came<00:04:19.660> out<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.080> i<00:04:20.290> think<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.770> kindle

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
fire came out but i think the kindle

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.130 
fire came out but i think the kindle
fire<00:04:21.250> came<00:04:21.520> out<00:04:21.700> about<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:22.060> year<00:04:22.510> after<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.930> had

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
fire came out about a year after I had

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.100 
fire came out about a year after I had
my<00:04:23.290> atrix<00:04:23.470> 4g<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.670> atrix<00:04:25.000> 4g<00:04:25.120> was<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:26.020> of

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
my atrix 4g and the atrix 4g was one of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.020 
my atrix 4g and the atrix 4g was one of
the<00:04:26.200> first<00:04:26.440> ever<00:04:26.710> if<00:04:27.010> not<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.490> first<00:04:27.520> ever

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
the first ever if not the first ever

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.630 
the first ever if not the first ever
phones<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:29.200> have<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> dual<00:04:29.710> core<00:04:29.920> processor<00:04:29.950> in

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
phones to have a dual core processor in

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.490 
phones to have a dual core processor in
it<00:04:30.700> so<00:04:30.910> yeah<00:04:31.150> just<00:04:32.010> yeah<00:04:33.010> that's<00:04:33.190> about<00:04:33.340> how

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
it so yeah just yeah that's about how

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.050 
it so yeah just yeah that's about how
you<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.800> don't<00:04:36.310> know<00:04:36.370> how<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> explain<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:36.910> I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
you can I don't know how to explain it I

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.810 
you can I don't know how to explain it I
can<00:04:37.270> nothing<00:04:37.990> about<00:04:38.230> but<00:04:38.560> yeah<00:04:39.220> this

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
can nothing about but yeah this

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.730 
can nothing about but yeah this
performance<00:04:40.540> feeds<00:04:40.900> are<00:04:41.230> noticeably

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
performance feeds are noticeably

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.190 
performance feeds are noticeably
different<00:04:41.980> now<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.210> isn't<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.660> fastest

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
different now this isn't the fastest

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.450 
different now this isn't the fastest
processor<00:04:44.920> I've<00:04:45.040> ever<00:04:45.190> used<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:46.830> mean<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.250> is

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
processor I've ever used I mean this is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.280 
processor I've ever used I mean this is
just<00:04:48.490> X<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:48.970> O's<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:49.360> quad<00:04:49.630> it's<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.050> same

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
just X and O's for quad it's the same

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.430 
just X and O's for quad it's the same
processor<00:04:51.190> as<00:04:51.220> far<00:04:52.000> as<00:04:52.150> i<00:04:52.300> can<00:04:52.360> remember<00:04:52.870> it's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
processor as far as i can remember it's

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.220 
processor as far as i can remember it's
the<00:04:53.590> same<00:04:53.800> processor<00:04:54.400> used<00:04:54.760> in<00:04:54.970> tat<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.630> the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
the same processor used in tat in the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.660 
the same processor used in tat in the
note<00:04:56.440> 10.1<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:58.290> i've<00:04:59.290> used<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.770> note<00:04:59.920> 10.1<00:05:00.130> and

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
note 10.1 and i've used a note 10.1 and

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.310 
note 10.1 and i've used a note 10.1 and
as<00:05:00.760> fast<00:05:01.030> as<00:05:01.330> well<00:05:01.480> but<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.960> big<00:05:02.140> it's

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
as fast as well but it's the big it's

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.050 
as fast as well but it's the big it's
just<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.560> bigger<00:05:02.740> screen<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.610> know<00:05:03.670> same

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
just a bigger screen you know same

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.500 
just a bigger screen you know same
resolution<00:05:04.390> as<00:05:04.780> far<00:05:05.290> as<00:05:05.410> i<00:05:05.500> remember<00:05:06.270> but<00:05:07.270> yeah

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
resolution as far as i remember but yeah

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.940 
resolution as far as i remember but yeah
well<00:05:09.450> not<00:05:10.450> much<00:05:10.660> else<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.140> talk<00:05:11.440> about<00:05:11.500> i'll
