00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.600 
in the locker room to come back out a
signal<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.990> mean<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.980> just<00:01:56.190> kind<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.400> we<00:01:56.490> had

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
signal I mean it was just kind of we had

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.150 
signal I mean it was just kind of we had
a<00:01:56.640> man<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.870> it's<00:01:58.650> something<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.010> had

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
a man up because it's something we had

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.480 
a man up because it's something we had
to<00:01:59.190> do<00:01:59.400> something<00:02:00.330> we<00:02:00.390> knew<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.810> could<00:02:00.990> do

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
to do something we knew that we could do

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.860 
to do something we knew that we could do
we<00:02:02.490> thought<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.790> dominated<00:02:02.940> them<00:02:03.330> in<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.720> few

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
we thought we dominated them in a few

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.890 
we thought we dominated them in a few
facets<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.410> game<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.600> we'd<00:02:06.750> back

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
facets of the game so I think we'd back

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.870 
facets of the game so I think we'd back
yourself<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> recipe<00:02:08.640> was<00:02:08.729> just
