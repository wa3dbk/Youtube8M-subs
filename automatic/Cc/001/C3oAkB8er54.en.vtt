00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 bounty presents an ingredient to a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 Puerto Rican delicacy 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.720
 the help is fried is part of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.969
 our daily diet but as to the 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.130
 Puerto Ricans love to take things to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 another level we are going to invent chops 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.090
 but stuffed with yellow cheese and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 chorizo this is a tremendous 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 treat and we go quickly around here look 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.660
 this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 Normal chuletita acaben chévere and here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 the chuletita already golden but with a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.900
 little bag over here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.880
 with a hole to then be able 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.550
 reign the first of all I'm going to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.590
 show how this obviously is done 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.980
 filling really simple you have to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 have a bit of onion already minced 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.489
 ok let's start subtracting here 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.690
 well chopped it is important that it is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.640
 well chopped to see it so you can 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.840
 fill it well you know vílchez briquet 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.789
 of gay couple 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 then we have here a little bit 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.010
 of garlic we go here quickly to sauté 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 Look what the hell and here we're going to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 add the chorizo ​​and minced 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.870
 you see depending for two 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 chops approximately I would tell them 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.500
 that a body of pounds more or less than 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 chorizo you add the amount that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.980
 you want also depends on the size 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 of the chop 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.840
 we have yellow well fine well well 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 well minced it's also important that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 we have them minced 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.990
 we are this mix also could 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.030
 grind if you want it and then it's 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.740
 sure that obviously for the filling 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.810
 it will be much better and more practical we will 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.610
 add declare a little salt because 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.710
 already the chorizo has really is like 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 salty if we do not really want it not 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 we get this simple preparation a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.010
 once we have this that more or less like 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 about two minutes we will continue 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 suffering we add dad's cheese or the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 cheese is your predilection is scratched for 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.050
 that obviously we do not want to be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.790
 burn and cheese but we can not turn off the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.530
 fire then we add them to it 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.720
 melts and then it compacts a little 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 here we have this preparation done 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.770
 it says ok we come here very simple for 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.570
 to see how this process is done as 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 you mentioned let's do it with a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.310
 little pocket here and right there is that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 we are going to fill this delight of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.240
 recipes we come here with the same 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.160
 spoon and we will see it pushing us 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.050
 slightly inward so that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 completely fill yourself with a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.840
 knife well to moraditos does this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.780
 cut that is done just as can 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.610
 talk with my friends in squares 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.530
 what are the ones where I buy all the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 ingredients here in the kitchen a day and 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.920
 he tells them look with this morning chop a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.080
 little bit wider than I do a little 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.240
 difficult to see it to leave it with greater 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.550
 Chef and they will gladly because you 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.840
 they try to actually do what they 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.970
 what we do look for fact but today my 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.170
 people the king of seafood plaza 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.760
 good knee what we do here look 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.230
 we put a thread with half 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 and the remains of cakes could be 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.480
 then we grab and place here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.599
 we went through here below the double 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.219
 laura part of the thread we come here and look 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.950

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.739
 little run without clicking here then that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.870
 we turn around and come and tie a knot in 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.810
 the part of here this obviously for 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.329
 avoid that this filling comes out ok 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.129
 I could also do it without the thread but 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.870
 very careful when you are going to seal 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.700
