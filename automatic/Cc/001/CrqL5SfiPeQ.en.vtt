back to wearing it curly obviously its

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.540 
back to wearing it curly obviously its
wake<00:00:14.820> earlier<00:00:15.389> than<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.170> before<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
wake earlier than it was before I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.880 
wake earlier than it was before I
straightened<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> odd<00:00:19.590> for

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
straightened it which is kind of odd for

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
straightened it which is kind of odd for
me<00:00:19.920> normally<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:21.180> natural<00:00:21.720> hair<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> not

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
me normally my natural hair is not

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
me normally my natural hair is not
affected<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.130> after<00:00:24.029> wearing<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
affected at all after wearing it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.779 
affected at all after wearing it
straight<00:00:24.630> even<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.519> constantly<00:00:26.519> been

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
straight even if it's constantly been

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
straight even if it's constantly been
straightened<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> month<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.380> only

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
straightened for like a month and I only

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.140 
straightened for like a month and I only
let<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> breathe<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.279> once<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.609> twice<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
let it breathe like once or twice like a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
let it breathe like once or twice like a
couple<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.380> know<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.679> done<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> few

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
couple you know I've done that a few

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.750 
couple you know I've done that a few
times<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> past<00:00:33.059> um<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.710> curl<00:00:35.070> pattern

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
times in the past um but my curl pattern

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
times in the past um but my curl pattern
seems<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.660> tighter<00:00:37.140> than<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.219> before<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
seems a lot tighter than it was before I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.819 
seems a lot tighter than it was before I
straightened<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
straightened it so that's kind of

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
straightened it so that's kind of
different<00:00:44.000> um<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.500> like

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
different um but I like it a lot I like

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
different um but I like it a lot I like
you<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> doesn't<00:00:47.430> bother<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you know it doesn't bother me at all the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
you know it doesn't bother me at all the
only<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> bugging<00:00:50.219> me<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
only thing that is kind of bugging me a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
only thing that is kind of bugging me a
little<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.480> flatter<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
little bit is it's a lot flatter it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
little bit is it's a lot flatter it
don't<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.460> volume<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.239> had

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
don't have as much volume as I had

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.260 
don't have as much volume as I had
before<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.860> haven't<00:00:56.399> been<00:00:56.640> letting<00:00:57.180> my

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
before and I haven't been letting my

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
before and I haven't been letting my
hair<00:00:57.510> air-dry<00:00:57.870> I've<00:00:58.410> been<00:00:58.590> defusing<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> from

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
hair air-dry I've been defusing it from

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
hair air-dry I've been defusing it from
you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.570> after<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> apply<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> product<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
you know after I apply the product to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.420 
you know after I apply the product to
the<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.510> um<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.110> thought<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> would<00:01:05.220> help

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the end so um I thought that would help

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850 
the end so um I thought that would help
add<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.479> bit<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:06.960> volume<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
add a little bit more volume but it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.240 
add a little bit more volume but it
hasn't<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.580> done<00:01:09.060> much<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:10.470> terms<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
hasn't really done much in terms of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
hasn't really done much in terms of
volume<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> has<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.630> enhanced<00:01:13.170> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
volume it has just really enhanced my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.160 
volume it has just really enhanced my
curl<00:01:13.500> pattern<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.580> I've<00:01:15.330> been<00:01:15.450> having<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
curl pattern so I've been having to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
curl pattern so I've been having to
tease<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.119> don't

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
tease it a little bit which I don't

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.560 
tease it a little bit which I don't
really<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.890> um<00:01:20.330> but<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
really like to do at all um but just a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
really like to do at all um but just a
little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little bit in the back and then on the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.190 
little bit in the back and then on the
sides<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.689> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> root

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
sides a little bit like at the root

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.100 
sides a little bit like at the root
seats<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.580> volume<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
seats got a little more volume in the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.270 
seats got a little more volume in the
back<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.820> seems<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:30.570> shorter<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
back and it seems a little bit shorter I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
back and it seems a little bit shorter I
think<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.369> cuz<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.820> curls<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.240> tighter<00:01:33.479> but

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
think it's cuz the curls are tighter but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
think it's cuz the curls are tighter but
it<00:01:34.470> doesn't<00:01:34.740> bother<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.280> honestly<00:01:35.939> think

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it doesn't bother me I honestly think

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.260 
it doesn't bother me I honestly think
that<00:01:36.329> uh<00:01:36.689> my<00:01:37.409> hair<00:01:37.619> long<00:01:38.220> curly<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> don't

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that uh my hair long curly I don't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
that uh my hair long curly I don't
really<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.900> look<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.350> good<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
really think it would look that good but

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.830 
really think it would look that good but
we'll<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.400> cuz<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> grow<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> out

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we'll see cuz i do want to grow it out

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
we'll see cuz i do want to grow it out
um<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> grow<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> see

um just to grow it out and just to see
how<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:45.990> looks<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.619> i'm<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.520> sure<00:01:47.759> how
