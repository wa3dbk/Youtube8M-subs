00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.080
 first thing what you see now luca 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.410
 when he entered a locker room of his 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.410
 desks 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.669
 the bunga stay focused as between 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:18.529
 48 hours resolves years was a series that 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.750
 started for so many reasons you know not 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.460
 environmental and not just technical so 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.720
 very particular for the many ex for the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.140
 fact that both in the final had always 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.520
 dominated against Milan it served a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.410
 more work on your head for 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.530
 approach this race 1 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.920
 I think we are very focused 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.860
 after two difficult series against Pistoia 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.710
 and Sassari where we understood so much 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.660
 therefore of our team identity 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.170
 it's about staying focused of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.399
 play every possession one hundred percent 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.829
 they are a great team are well 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.890
 train never give up 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.679
 and then nothing in 48 hours replayed 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.089
 we want to prepare ourselves for the best revealed 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.460
 a great merit if you leave again strong 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.250
 wanted to pick it up right away their 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080
 they have never been lovers you have suffered 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.070
 impressed your rhythm to the match at 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.049
 away from the fact that then we have them 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 recovered up to that minus 12 before that 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.860
 you resume it permanently in 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.310
 hand is there the key is to approach 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 technically good for every match 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.009
 race is a story if we started today 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.799
 with a bang because it's short 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.509
 a series of incredible triples 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.810
 we have managed the well 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.369
 advantage we never gave the idea of 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 panic even when they are 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.810
 come back at least 10 and that's a good one 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.640
 a sign of maturity that we want 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.950
 bring back for the next game 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 at home that is very important 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.920
 the last thing how much you believe in 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.220
 difficulties of being especially in shooting 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.899
 from three points in ball circulation 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.390
 as I said before every game has one 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.909
 story to themselves if they did 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.890
 fatigue the next could slip 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.540
 a great statistical game 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 However 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.260
 we don't have to think about this 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.390
 thinking about ourselves the last is like 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.940
 are you 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.000
 stop am 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.770
 It's been seven days since I got there 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.850
 I'm done wrong I'm not a hundred 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.830
 a hundred, however, for no reason in the world 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.900
 I would have stayed to see a game of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.030
 final so I want to give what 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 I can give the team an apology 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 Mom because she does n't listen to me 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.640
 said to stand still will be worried 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.110
 but I wanted to be there 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.760
 we reassure you thanks for damages to have 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.760
 congratulations to you maurizi stefano
