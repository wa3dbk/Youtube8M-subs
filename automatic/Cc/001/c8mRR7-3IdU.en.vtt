00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.100
 we as we cast our 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.050
 chili and cheese taquitos 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.240
 quiet but we believe that you 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.900
 They are hungry so what do you think if 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.360
 we started making roast beef not here 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.190
 something very common is that at this moment 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.140
 just with the meat lady babe we 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.140
 you want that is when you get involved 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.890
 the men of the house that's why it's 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.500
 here Jorge with us to see but before 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.000
 of that he has a good secret to see 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.550
 I will recommend them 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.560
 with great of the species that have to 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.630
 have in their house the ones that are most 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.059
 like in this case I have to 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.850
 combination of cumin oregano and laurel 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.960
 and that is going to add it to add 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.330
 to charcoal so that it releases its aroma to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.370
 normal water 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.620
 clear, look what a good guy so 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.460
 when they make roast meat whether the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.640
 tea do it with charcoal maybe with firewood 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 add this mixture feel healthy and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 really delicious 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:19.170
 the lady good and immediately 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 we can already put our porte 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.160
 now notice the meat is so good that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.440
 practically not healthy you did not put him 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.770
 nothing you're not going to season it, let's use it 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.320
 with a little grain salt in this case 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.990
 I'll put them here but normal salt 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 I recommend them 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.549
 flower grain salt can be flower 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.729
 jamaica there is a great variety of salts 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 of grain but it 's the only thing that you add 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.250
 it is the only thing apart from the species 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
 Coal the salt directly to the meat 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 we also passed him the courier 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.580
 just to our dear jorge that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.039
 you are going to take care of the meat 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.060

 and to accompany this meat also 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.110

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.430
