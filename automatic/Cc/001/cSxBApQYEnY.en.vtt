00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:13.849
 Here I am going to show you already finished dt g could join all the points 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.169
 i here what I do 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:21.179
 I can do a finished one time to what is the front part and what is it 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.640
 the neck then after having joined the point here what I'm going to 

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.019
 proceed to be a species in a chain 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 preferably a reinforced chain so that the point will not get 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.079
 this said in the part here and do not go to flockhart what part of the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 last point that we unite 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 but that being this chain we are going to go backwards and for example 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.000
 the percent point 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.380
 the tip crab for tejero in the points that are flying protect from 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.940
 this way 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 we can fit insane we can not fit in 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.670
 so for example here I am going to knit it without fitting 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.079
 I'm looking at just 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 sharp corp 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 and these two acts 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 again 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.620
 here I am going to knit 2 because because you are very broad this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.960
 I put my hook sharp corp 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.630
 and go back out 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 there will be two points there 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.690
 I will continue on the next point what is this meto milan only took gold 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.460
 and I go back to satan 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.900
 Now at this high point buoy through the inter-mil only in the hole 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.030
 I take sharp corp 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.490
 and good to dry 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.550
 here are going to be two 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.790
 I put my hook sharp corp 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.210
 and I go back 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.140
 and now between 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.950
 back and forth silvia this point 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 here me to milan only sharp corp 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.770
 and I go back to satan 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.810
 and so let's proceed 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.220
 up to the end 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.620
 all around 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.380
 of this one of what is the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 letizia 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.899
 and here we are going to finish 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.350
 even though I'm finished, I'm going to show you so you can appreciate 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.789
 the difference between one that has already finished 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.789
 i 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.350
 well here to get to the last point and I want to show you how it is here 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.099
 I'm going to the middle part 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.519
 Fitted to quote 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.969
 the intention of the last point crab 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.029
 in this way 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.729
 so 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:42.659
 that's how we finished what is the part here from the front and 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.399
 that here we already know if we put buttons or that we put the neck or 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.229
 just with the buttons and I was up already it's like cakes 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.379
 in that fair and better 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.819
 here I to finish 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 yew two very reinforced chains 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.829
 and cut the war 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.939
 like this long so that then you can side tips 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.819
 let's continue here with what are the sleeves of this destination 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:17.609
 here 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.450
 we should consider that it is counted 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.620
 it takes 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410
 multiples of t3 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.769
 then I already took accounts 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.769
 and if I get the multi power and the multiple of three 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.090
 i here below are six points 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.439
 and up here I think they are 18 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.439
 so let's start with two very reinforced chains 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.819
 in this way 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.299
 they leave one was long enough to hide it 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.499
 and on the side of 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.889
 ahead of what is the front let's start being the stitch 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.499
 this we are going to weave in a way that he 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.629
 circular we will not turn the fabric to make it part of the back once 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.039
 so let's start here that the middle part 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.799
 That would be the part of here 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.200
 because here are three 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.379
 and the others will be here on this side 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.479
 so here is 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.319
 one 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.319
 2 3 in this part 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.099
 in this text I'm going to fit 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.000
 and take a point out to go 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.270
 and let milocco ready and start 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.009
 I start with three chains 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.629
 to raise the first high point 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.010
 here when we are weaving tissues so small we put 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.920
 the finger for what percent avoid accidents and that we grab the order of 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.849
 the back or the fabric of the back 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.229
 we have here our three high points this account we are going to weave with 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.020
 high points we're just going 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.699
 to knit high points 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.930
 points on points the point that follows is this 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.930
 here I'm going to knit another high point 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.120
 and the next point would be this one 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 this is where I go to third parties 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.089
 if the three points are already fixed 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.319
 I'm going to lose another three points in this part of here 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.529
 because here is one turn 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.569
 then here buoy fit 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.569
 one 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.309
 everyone 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.139
 three points 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.830
 and in the following 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.830
 I will fit a single point nothing more firm 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.729
 one 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.050
 and we are going to tell 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.169
 point to point they have to be 18 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.169
 this would be 2 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.150
 two 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 this what follows sevilla 3 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.570
 4 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.570
 point by point and now we continue 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.270
 this is how it is what is the manga 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.310
 then here I am going to weave another two laps 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.710
 I already like implementing what is here is aimed so that the two laps 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.120
 that I have left want this same point 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.460
 although I'm going to show you how
