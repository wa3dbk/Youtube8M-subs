00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello people welcome to a something 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 another video then it is a tag video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.450
 because I saw that sounds like it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.340
 was twice a day once from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.269
 phoenix like women once from fm fifa 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.809
 big on the boys yes that's one 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.359
 interesting day usually 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.300
 directed tech center how to store the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 Of course, there are a few other questions 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 through the scene we have are one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.410
 a little bit of other questions is in five 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.289
 ask me about that a bit 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 I say my playing career now 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.050
 So there are questions like that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 I get to play right are the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 is all that kind of a chain letter that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 means I'm shown by someone what 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.410
 I would 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.360
 and I enter at the end of this video 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.390
 and that should be synonymous a video 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.579
 do it and ask them 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 So answer everything very relaxed and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.809
 funny and i will be in the end and then 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 one thinks I do not have any now 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.760
 idea 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.930
 in the background will be any pack 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.670
 I'll see you someday 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.149
 I had no idea then sad 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.619
 and so are five questions and the first one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.659
 is how you are then to gamble 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.189
 come that's a pretty interesting one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 ask because I take it already 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 pretty long ago because I think so 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 have my first game somehow with 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.439
 So six or five are included 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.680
 Almost five or ten years ago 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.630
 and I think I'm gambling then 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 come because I play the pokémon 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 want to have and answer that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 also immediately my next question believe 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 But I am so then actually 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.729
 rather come together by yourself 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.220
 killing pokémon wanted to have and before 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 from time to time with other people stop 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.580
 have played in the imagination for themselves 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.500
 then sometimes 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.970
 with other children had the stop 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.700
 Probable gamer I think was 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.050
 that and question 2 is with what age 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.180
 did you play your first game that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.430
 his would have as I said 56 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.760
 I do not believe much earlier 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.900
 really say something or not 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.840
 intense or interested 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.670
 that men were really attentive and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 So now when I'm on 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.700
 button pressure and do not know what 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.750
 happened is not right for me 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 play 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.280
 The third question is what was your first 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.020
 You have to console now in winter 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.990
 my first console seem generally 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.970
 was the snes so the super nintendo and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.630
 my first hand was the game boy color 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.340
 So the gemballa was definitely as 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.770
 first of 1999 I think with you 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 pokémon blue what next 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.950
 question is what was your first 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.130
 game that was definitely pokémon the blue one 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.560
 edition yes somehow everyone had always 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.510
 red only I had blue 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.459
 that was as always so for example 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.120
 now more people have y as ex and 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.820
 fx interesting but good and on the snes 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.310
 was the f zero incredible speak 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.260
 I like to talk about it today 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.330
 for the time to have or colleagues 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.150
 go whose companies have themselves 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.540
 already has sms and super mario world one 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.760
 and to to was namely with yoshi island 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 what a very funny game 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.570
 has this little mini mario this 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.440
 have played this baby mario with 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.090
 yoshi that was really funny and ask 5 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.980
 what was your first game which 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.989
 animal from your own money buying that 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.370
 that was a bit late I have to say 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.350
 because I was I'm pretty frowned upon 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.370
 I have to say that as a child 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.170
 that was really only in 2005 and it was 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.110
 when I gave myself my xbox the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.640
 first xbox by the way yes one year resp 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.800
 exactly in the year for the 360 out 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.750
 came very smart it was 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.250
 Wrestlemania 21 that's what I wanted 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.830
 I have to have that and I have 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.060
 me with gta san andreas bought at gta 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.860
 San Andreas I have so a bit 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.000
 get a lot is 21 and 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.799
 I have the console myself 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.430
 I have a savings account money for months 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.049
 Saved on it 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.290
 by the way, that is in no relation to 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.730
 the effect your video has the question 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.159
 and answer video what is still to come 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.239
 that will probably be today or 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.560
 Tomorrow I do not know if I will 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.139
 bring three videos today or tomorrow 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.579
 are looking because you are still too 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:06.159
 work and carolus and yes that was that 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.969
 Day again small and short and held 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.099
 I hope you enjoyed it and me 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.680
 say only one I think that is the max 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.180
 gaming tv is a good boy you can 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 take a look at him and tell him 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.669
 that I told him I will 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.740
 reinstall the channel link below 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.930
 just like you can ask me once 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 say a little what you like as yours 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.250
 first console had or first game or 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.050
 how you come to it, it already has one 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.360
 a bit long ago and there is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.410
 big memory gaps 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.210
 but I want to see what he is looking forward to 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.210
 Of course, what then says max gaming 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.740
 Requires demand and yes if you 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.110
 easy actions, of course, also pure 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.550
 because I'm so really in the head 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.229
 who had not made a video tag 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.690
 I'm a big one 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.520
 Rounder but I would definitely 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.810
 Find interesting what you are saying in 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.060
 the five ask as I said I like yes 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.039
 also in the video description and yes 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.039
 So that's his job
