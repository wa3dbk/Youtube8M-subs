be 100

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.380 
be 100
or<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.130> go<00:03:16.280> higher<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.300> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390

or you can go higher than that if you
want<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.600> but<00:03:18.140> 100<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.770> probably<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.310> max<00:03:19.640> you

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
want to but 100 is probably the max you

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.380

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
weapon you can start to see why because

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.130 
weapon you can start to see why because
if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.410> look<00:03:27.560> at<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.740> arm<00:03:28.010> it's<00:03:28.840> yeah<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.900> can

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
right you don't normally assuming two

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.870
