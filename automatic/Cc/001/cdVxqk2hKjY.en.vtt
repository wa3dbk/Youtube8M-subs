initially choosing Universal robots was

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.250 
initially choosing Universal robots was
that<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.030> needed<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.509> flexible<00:00:16.049> automation

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
that we needed a flexible automation

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920 
that we needed a flexible automation
solution<00:00:17.250> VL<00:00:18.119> by<00:00:18.270> teaming<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.510> make<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> lot<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
solution VL by teaming we make a lot of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870 
solution VL by teaming we make a lot of
changes<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.470> our<00:00:19.650> organization<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.820> fact

changes in our organization in fact

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.450 
changes in our organization in fact
we're<00:00:21.390> constantly<00:00:21.720> changing<00:00:22.109> workflows<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we're constantly changing workflows and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.189 
we're constantly changing workflows and
we<00:00:23.609> saw<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> benefit<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.480> quickly<00:00:24.810> being<00:00:24.990> able

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
we saw a benefit and quickly being able

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.640 
we saw a benefit and quickly being able
to<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.590> started<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> robot<00:00:30.080> before<00:00:31.080> we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to get started with the robot before we

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.380 
to get started with the robot before we
had<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> customize<00:00:32.460> each<00:00:32.730> automation

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
had to customize each automation

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.810 
had to customize each automation
application<00:00:34.050> around<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.860> specific<00:00:35.370> product

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
application around the specific product

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
application around the specific product
we<00:00:35.969> made<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:37.200> problem<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.710> such<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.219> set<00:00:38.520> up

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
we made the problem with such a set up

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
we made the problem with such a set up
is<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.750> short<00:00:40.020> term<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.250> can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
is that it's very short term and you can

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.090 
is that it's very short term and you can
only<00:00:41.579> use<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.300> special<00:00:42.719> function<00:00:43.100> next

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
only use it for a special function next

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
only use it for a special function next
time<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> change<00:00:44.700> production<00:00:45.239> flows<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
time you change production flows you

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.569 
time you change production flows you
have<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> completely<00:00:46.710> redesign<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have to completely redesign the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.080 
have to completely redesign the
application<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:49.559> robot<00:00:49.980> provides<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
application this robot provides a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
application this robot provides a
completely<00:00:51.809> different<00:00:51.989> strategic<00:00:52.710> advantage

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
completely different strategic advantage

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
completely different strategic advantage
as<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.239> reuse<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> next

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
as we can just reuse it on the next

as we can just reuse it on the next
project<00:01:01.910> during<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.090> startup<00:01:03.420> phase<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.960> were

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
project during the startup phase we were

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.969 
project during the startup phase we were
anxious<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> test<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> safety<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> robot

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
anxious to test the safety of the robot

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
anxious to test the safety of the robot
at<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.659> each<00:01:09.659> time<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.080> touched<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
at all both that each time we touched it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
at all both that each time we touched it
it<00:01:10.680> stopped<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.760> felt<00:01:12.060> safe<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> work<00:01:12.630> with

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it stopped so it felt safe to work with

started tested and programmed it I stood

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
started tested and programmed it I stood
right<00:01:18.840> next<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> robot<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> check<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right next to the robot to check that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390 
right next to the robot to check that
everything<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.330> intended<00:01:22.189> go<00:01:23.189> from

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
everything was going as intended go from

the I think whenever I get in the robots
away<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.530> stops<00:01:28.860> really<00:01:29.280> easily<00:01:29.840> afterwards

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
away it stops really easily afterwards

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.649 
away it stops really easily afterwards
you<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> reset<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> restart<00:01:32.579> it
