 so call that I can put you going 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.060

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.070
 if of any accident with my wife 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.170
 so that they tell me results of what 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.030
 it happened but we continue with we went out to put 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.370
 music or in the time of joy and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.720
 sense of the house intact for me the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.100

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.320
 taste in that sense work of frank te 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.159
 You can take care that I am the best in 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.650
 this if he complained yes yes yes yes yes 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.979

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.390
 you talk to him and Dr. Ortega speaks 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.009
 Stress doctor as you realize 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 layers all with my wife a half 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.680
 how it feels all right I feel 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.510
 well a little pain 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 the head but I feel good and the plate 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.830
 how everything was from a fracture but 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.230
 I can walk at least good I'll 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.520
 I have to say that his wife 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.520
 unfortunately she is alive 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.620
 she imputed the two legs 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.970
 you have to have a lot 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.700
 patience but there's already there we go have a 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.680
 an arm problem is that I think so 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.130
 continue as we are going to amputate the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.450
 arm the left arm 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 problems in the liver 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.680
 you have a wave to do your needs 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.079
 you have to feed him more or less every 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 half to 40 minutes feed it well by 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.080
 liquid 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.330
 almost gave him a stroke in the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.060
 operation 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.160
 but as soon as I do everything but returned 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.210
 he has been scared 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.210
 already died
