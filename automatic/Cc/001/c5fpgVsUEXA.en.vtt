hook it through this hook right here so
now<00:00:25.430> we're<00:00:25.700> just<00:00:25.730> turning<00:00:26.419> this<00:00:26.599> dial<00:00:26.899> right

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
now we're just turning this dial right

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.120 
now we're just turning this dial right
here<00:00:27.320> on<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.800> side<00:00:28.210> we're<00:00:29.210> going<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.450> turn<00:00:29.660> it

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
the way at the top so we're taking the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.100 
the way at the top so we're taking the
thread<00:00:41.180> that's<00:00:41.300> already<00:00:41.510> been<00:00:41.690> hooked<00:00:41.960> or

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
thread that's already been hooked or

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.060 
thread that's already been hooked or
here<00:00:42.290> we're<00:00:42.830> going<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.010> go<00:00:43.160> right<00:00:43.460> behind<00:00:43.850> here

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
here we're going to go right behind here

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.500 
here we're going to go right behind here
the<00:00:46.070> thread<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.760> third<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.120> going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.300> lay

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
the thread the third is going to lay

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.280 
the thread the third is going to lay
right<00:00:47.960> behind<00:00:48.260> here<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.780> it's<00:00:50.780> going<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.020> come

right behind here and it's going to come
down<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:51.920> way<00:00:56.290> then<00:00:57.290> what<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:57.950> it's<00:00:58.100> going<00:00:58.280> to

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
down this way then what is it's going to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.010 
down this way then what is it's going to
do<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:58.790> going<00:00:58.880> to<00:00:59.030> come<00:00:59.270> down<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.750> part

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
do is it's going to come down this part

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.479 
do is it's going to come down this part
right<00:01:00.170> here<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:01.239> one<00:01:02.239> right<00:01:02.270> here<00:01:03.489> then

right here this one right here then
you're<00:01:04.670> going<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> want<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.770> loop<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.979> under

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
you're going to want to loop it under

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.920 
you're going to want to loop it under
here<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:11.210> bring<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.630> back<00:01:11.659> up

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.790 

and<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.070> loop<00:01:20.440> it's<00:01:21.440> going<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.650> go

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
and it's going to loop it's going to go

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.100 
and it's going to loop it's going to go
this<00:01:22.370> way<00:01:22.430> then<00:01:22.970> you're<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.300> want<00:01:24.020> to

this way then you're going to want to
bring<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.500> around<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.070> come<00:01:25.550> right<00:01:26.420> back<00:01:27.190> down

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
bring it around and come right back down

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.520 
bring it around and come right back down
with<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> bridge<00:01:28.870> right<00:01:29.870> here<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:33.170> it

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
with the bridge right here so it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.730 
with the bridge right here so it
basically<00:01:33.620> goes<00:01:34.130> from<00:01:34.190> here<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.480> hook<00:01:35.740> to

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
basically goes from here to the hook to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.050 
basically goes from here to the hook to
behind<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:38.140> down<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.410> way<00:01:39.680> back<00:01:40.520> up<00:01:40.820> this

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
an automatic needle threader so all you

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.790 
an automatic needle threader so all you
have<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> do<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:05.110> mash<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.290> all<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.500> way<00:02:06.590> down

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
have to do is mash it all the way down

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.240 
have to do is mash it all the way down
and<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.959> will<00:02:08.959> loop<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.440> thread<00:02:09.470> over<00:02:09.950> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and you will loop the thread over this

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.010 
and you will loop the thread over this
and<00:02:10.580> pull<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.000> tightly<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.570> what's<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.990> to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and pull it tightly and what's going to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.390 
and pull it tightly and what's going to
happen<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.470> once<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.770> go<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:13.070> once<00:02:13.280> you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
happen is once you go like once you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.610 
happen is once you go like once you
release<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.600> going<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.870> take<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.170> loop<00:02:15.350> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
release it's going to take the loop and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.690 
release it's going to take the loop and
it's<00:02:15.709> going<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.950> insert<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.430> through<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
it's going to insert it through the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:27.010 
it's going to insert it through the
little<00:02:16.970> hole<00:02:17.480> right<00:02:17.630> here

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.470 

so<00:02:27.560> taking<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> thread<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.330> make<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
so taking the thread going to make a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.070 
so taking the thread going to make a
loop<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:34.570> like<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.630> kind<00:02:35.960> of<00:02:36.020> just

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
loop like this I like to kind of just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.540 
loop like this I like to kind of just
hold<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.470> place<00:02:36.680> just<00:02:36.710> while<00:02:37.070> I'm<00:02:37.160> doing<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
hold in place just while I'm doing this

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.120 
hold in place just while I'm doing this
and<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.570> pull<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.870> tight<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.050> let<00:02:39.380> go<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.770> you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
and you pull it tight and let go and you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.350 
and you pull it tight and let go and you
can<00:02:40.280> see<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.870> threaded<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.270> you

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
can see it threaded it for you so you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.770 
can see it threaded it for you so you
just<00:02:44.390> pull<00:02:44.780> up<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.960> other<00:02:45.230> end<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:46.480> this

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
just pull up the other end like this

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.860 
just pull up the other end like this
and<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.830> bring<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.240> can<00:02:50.480> bring<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
and you bring that now you can bring the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
and you bring that now you can bring the
back<00:02:51.050> up<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.250> bring<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.940> under<00:02:55.180> how

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
back up and you can bring this under how

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.310 
back up and you can bring this under how
to<00:02:56.240> get<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.710> bottom<00:02:58.040> thread<00:02:58.840> with<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.870> top

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
to get the bottom thread with the top

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.540 
to get the bottom thread with the top
three<00:03:00.710> all<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.880> do<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:03.190> turn<00:03:04.190> this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
three all you have to do is turn this

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.090 
three all you have to do is turn this
handle<00:03:05.680> until<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.920> needle<00:03:07.130> reaches<00:03:07.730> down<00:03:07.970> and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
handle until the needle reaches down and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:19.360 
handle until the needle reaches down and
picks<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:10.250> up

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.890 

pick<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.610> right<00:03:20.790> there<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.630> see<00:03:21.780> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
pick it up right there you can see it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.370 
pick it up right there you can see it
picked<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.200> up<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:27.170> tug<00:03:28.170> on

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
picked it up so then you can just tug on

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.460 
picked it up so then you can just tug on
it<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.120> will<00:03:30.210> come<00:03:30.870> up<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:33.090> pull<00:03:33.480> opposite

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it and it will come up you pull opposite

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.470 
it and it will come up you pull opposite
and<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.850> already<00:03:36.030> threaded

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and there you go it's already threaded

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.320 
and there you go it's already threaded
so<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:36.950> you're<00:03:37.950> ready<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.790> make<00:03:38.940> sure<00:03:39.120> both

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
so then you're ready just make sure both

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.430 
so then you're ready just make sure both
pieces<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:40.260> thread<00:03:41.010> are<00:03:41.700> behind<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.230> top

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
pieces of thread are behind here the top

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.320 
pieces of thread are behind here the top
one<00:03:43.650> will<00:03:43.830> go<00:03:43.950> through<00:03:44.310> here<00:03:44.610> under<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
one will go through here under here and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.170 
one will go through here under here and
behind<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.959> there<00:03:46.410> both<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.740> behind<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:48.000> then

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
behind and there both be behind so then

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.030 
behind and there both be behind so then
it's<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:49.020> ready<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.530> start<00:03:49.640> your<00:03:50.640> sewing
