00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
tank so what I've done is I've put a 36

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
tank so what I've done is I've put a 36
inch<00:01:16.320> fixture<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.659> I've<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
inch fixture on here and I've kind of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
inch fixture on here and I've kind of
got<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> angled<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
got it angled right now you can see it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.190 
got it angled right now you can see it
like<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:23.540> I'm<00:01:24.540> thinking<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.049> might

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
like like that and I'm thinking I might

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
like like that and I'm thinking I might
hang<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> wall<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.970> down<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
hang it off the wall or down from the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.310 
hang it off the wall or down from the
ceiling<00:01:28.310> if<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.670> some<00:01:29.850> time<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> haven't

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
ceiling if I get some time but I haven't

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.810 
ceiling if I get some time but I haven't
yet<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
yet this is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.590 
yet this is
a<00:01:34.880> heating<00:01:35.630> lamp<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.060> turtle-duck

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
little bit didn't fit underneath my

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.150

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
real life it looks a little bit cloudy

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.170 
real life it looks a little bit cloudy
on<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.350> phone<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.000> it's<00:03:27.000> uh<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.600> very<00:03:28.080> clear

on the phone but it's uh it's very clear
and<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.480> output<00:03:31.070> is<00:03:32.070> quite<00:03:32.400> nice<00:03:32.610> that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
and the output is quite nice that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.950 
and the output is quite nice that
provides<00:03:34.950> current<00:03:35.430> for<00:03:35.580> my<00:03:35.670> entire<00:03:35.940> tank<00:03:36.330> I've

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.240 
even done it this and there's a little
bit<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.910> current<00:03:39.150> which<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:43.040> my<00:03:44.040> lights

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
bit of current which I like my lights

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.110

Shirelles to show you I've just got some
driftwood<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.720> then<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.680> my<00:03:52.830> only<00:03:53.010> live

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
driftwood and then this is my only live

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.300 
driftwood and then this is my only live
plant<00:03:53.550> so<00:03:53.730> far<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.150> java<00:03:54.390> fern<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.310> it's

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
plant so far it's a java fern and it's

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.340 
plant so far it's a java fern and it's
doing<00:03:56.970> really<00:03:57.150> well<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.600> wasn't<00:03:57.840> looking<00:03:58.230> too

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
doing really well it wasn't looking too

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.170 
doing really well it wasn't looking too
healthy<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.860> bought<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.160> but<00:04:00.000> it's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
healthy when I bought it but it's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.589 
healthy when I bought it but it's
actually<00:04:00.690> uh<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:02.100> actually

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.569 

even<00:04:09.230> though<00:04:09.379> I<00:04:09.439> think<00:04:09.530> they<00:04:09.769> like<00:04:09.950> stone<00:04:10.250> more

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
even though I think they like stone more

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.890 
even though I think they like stone more
but<00:04:11.319> they<00:04:12.319> do<00:04:12.469> okay<00:04:12.799> in<00:04:12.859> here<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:14.420> these<00:04:14.719> are

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
but they do okay in here and these are

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.289 
but they do okay in here and these are
that<00:04:15.290> big<00:04:15.530> piece<00:04:15.739> there<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.759> piece<00:04:17.030> here

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
that big piece there and this piece here

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.229 
that big piece there and this piece here
Ironwood<00:04:17.979> this<00:04:18.979> piece<00:04:19.190> hasn't<00:04:19.549> sunk<00:04:19.759> yet<00:04:19.970> it's

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
Ironwood this piece hasn't sunk yet it's

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.279 
Ironwood this piece hasn't sunk yet it's
like<00:04:20.359> driftwood<00:04:21.109> typed<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:23.419> then<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.139> is

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
like driftwood typed and then this is

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.600 
like driftwood typed and then this is
actually<00:04:24.470> fake<00:04:24.889> here<00:04:26.080> which<00:04:27.310> doesn't<00:04:28.310> look<00:04:28.400> as

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
actually fake here which doesn't look as

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.240 
actually fake here which doesn't look as
good<00:04:28.639> as<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.970> other<00:04:29.090> pieces<00:04:29.330> but<00:04:31.060> it's<00:04:32.060> okay

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:44.210 

and<00:04:36.250> then<00:04:36.640> for<00:04:37.090> food<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.840> have<00:04:39.510> rectum<00:04:40.510> man
