00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.850
 a menu appears we go to play 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.549
 we go hosting in the same place already and stove 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.450
 you only tell a friend your port 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:04.159
 who screamed nickname copied this ip 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.929
 ip v4 then dude should put in there 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.300
 please shorten the servers you are here 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.879
 strongly how many people do you want 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.590
 password can put the port to change but 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.120
 it's better not to do the same with you 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 will be well safe you of course put safe and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.640
 if you want to play pvp 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.080
 for example so that your friend could kill you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.120
 then you are the site of the crowd 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.519
 If you do not want to put the apple in. 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.340
 then there is such a normal 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.849
 art easy this is what we see here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.730
 we have norms that is normal 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.540
 The default zombies that will be you straight 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.970
 so do not bite if eset iz then 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.209
 there is this player only 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.900
 play there will be no zombies there and there is 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.140
 of course hard it's generally hard as it were 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.439
 you should know this i think well then you 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.930
 Click here hosting for example yes I am 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.489
 sort of clicked all right well here guys 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.400
 I went to my server 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.590
 Vlad also came here we appeared on 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.569
 the server want you to say a couple of these 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 guys when you go out fold 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.409
 all your stuff because when you 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.840
 logout server stuff is not saved 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.329
 who are lying they will be gone 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.939
 neat also 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:27.849
 I also think that what else to tell and 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:30.310
 such a ruling that when you 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.970
 turn off your friend's game can 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.520
 strongly lag on it looking 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.310
 what base camp for example in what matter 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.500
 Well, how does he keep jumping it still depends 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.910
 from his compan he did not laguchy mighty 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.220
 preferably put in that friend who 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.010
 good internet so that they can 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.860
 I also want to play now I want to show you 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 an example of how Vlad came to me 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.170
 server we go out server disconnect well and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.870
 when you log off your server now 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.320
 you like a friend's server you want 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.810
 go to click here play 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.150
 this one's foam will be about 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.470
 or you will be without alpi at all 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.780
 You take and so put save Tes 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.519
 you connect you connect to the server here 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.920
 such a connection method is possible 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.600
 do and play with friends all 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.669
