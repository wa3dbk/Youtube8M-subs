00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of the time it just felt like I was just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
of the time it just felt like I was just
out<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.140> directing<00:00:58.649> traffic<00:00:59.090> but<00:01:00.090> after<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
out there directing traffic but after a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
out there directing traffic but after a
while<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.989> few<00:01:01.590> things<00:01:01.800> started<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> sink<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
while a few things started to sink in
really<00:01:03.780> quickly<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.439> realized<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> wasn't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
really quickly I realized that it wasn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
really quickly I realized that it wasn't
all<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.340> job<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:09.000> at

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
all about me it was my job to look at

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.820 
all about me it was my job to look at
the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.540> team<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:09.900> figure<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the other team and figure out how to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370 
the other team and figure out how to
facilitate<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.970> offense<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
facilitate things on offense so that we

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.190 
facilitate things on offense so that we
could<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.830> effective<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.460> possible<00:01:15.200> pretty

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
could be as effective as possible pretty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
could be as effective as possible pretty
soon<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:17.100> didn't<00:01:17.400> feel<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.000> like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
soon it didn't feel so much like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
soon it didn't feel so much like
directing<00:01:18.689> traffic<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.799> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
directing traffic but more like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.090 
directing traffic but more like
