being a guinea pig work and right now

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.060 
being a guinea pig work and right now
we're<00:00:34.300> going<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.450> be<00:00:34.540> working<00:00:34.750> on<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.590> cargo

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
we're going to be working on the cargo

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.400 
we're going to be working on the cargo
net<00:00:36.100> in<00:00:36.940> all<00:00:37.090> dirty<00:00:37.330> dozen<00:00:37.750> races<00:00:37.930> our<00:00:38.200> car

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
net in all dirty dozen races our car

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.020 
net in all dirty dozen races our car
going<00:00:38.590> straight<00:00:39.010> up<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.310> down<00:00:39.340> with<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
going straight up and down with the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.580 
going straight up and down with the
safety<00:00:40.480> mechanism<00:00:40.960> on<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.170> floor<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.470> make

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
safety mechanism on the floor to make

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.290 
safety mechanism on the floor to make
sure<00:00:41.740> people<00:00:41.890> remain<00:00:42.250> safe<00:00:42.490> but<00:00:43.030> this<00:00:43.150> is

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
sure people remain safe but this is

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.000 
sure people remain safe but this is
definitely<00:00:43.480> more<00:00:43.840> challenging<00:00:43.870> so<00:00:44.860> I<00:00:44.890> think

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
definitely more challenging so I think

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.380 
definitely more challenging so I think
the<00:00:45.340> best<00:00:45.520> thing<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.760> do<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.090> for<00:00:46.240> you<00:00:46.329> guys

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
the best thing to do is for you guys

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.200 
the best thing to do is for you guys
just<00:00:46.630> to<00:00:47.020> go<00:00:47.200> at<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.620> give<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.310> try<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.820> then

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
just to go at it give it a try and then

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.580 
just to go at it give it a try and then
will<00:00:49.329> critique<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.870> see<00:00:50.020> how<00:00:50.140> we<00:00:50.200> can<00:00:50.380> improve

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
will critique and see how we can improve

00:00:50.590 --> 00:01:09.709 
will critique and see how we can improve
the<00:00:50.770> technique<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.340> ditch<00:00:51.900> social<00:00:52.900> skills

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:26.960 

exciting

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.510 

so<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.830> notice<00:01:29.010> richest

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
so what the thing to notice richest

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
so what the thing to notice richest
technique<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.480> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.660> things<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.020> we

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
technique is one of the things that we

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
technique is one of the things that we
gave<00:01:31.320> him<00:01:31.470> before<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.430> picks<00:01:32.670> himself<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gave him before he picks himself a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
gave him before he picks himself a
channel<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.470> does<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.640> couple

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
channel and what this does is a couple

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.650 
channel and what this does is a couple
of<00:01:36.090> things<00:01:36.300> by<00:01:36.660> staying<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.260> channel<00:01:38.660> you're

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
of things by staying in a channel you're

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.040 
of things by staying in a channel you're
narrowing<00:01:40.490> got<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.640> body<00:01:41.910> because<00:01:42.660> the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
narrowing got your body because the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.650 
narrowing got your body because the
further<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.190> further<00:01:44.430> apart<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
further the further apart you get the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.170 
further the further apart you get the
wiring<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.230> get<00:01:46.440> wobbly<00:01:47.160> are<00:01:47.400> all<00:01:47.580> gets<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
wiring you get wobbly are all gets and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
wiring you get wobbly are all gets and
it<00:01:48.450> gets<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.690> lot<00:01:48.810> harder<00:01:48.960> where<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.830> by

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it gets a lot harder where it's by

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
it gets a lot harder where it's by
choosing<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> channel<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.870> what<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.260> do<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.440> we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
choosing a channel and what we do is we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.210 
choosing a channel and what we do is we
choose<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.010> line<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.660> they<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.230> I<00:01:55.500> think

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
choose one line and they go up I think

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.590 
choose one line and they go up I think
naturally<00:01:56.400> we<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:56.970> go<00:01:57.090> straight<00:01:57.360> into<00:01:57.480> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
naturally we always go straight into a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.180 
naturally we always go straight into a
hole<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.050> what<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.440> having<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:58.980> and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
hole so what I'm not having to do and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.980 
hole so what I'm not having to do and
we're<00:01:59.280> having<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> look<00:01:59.730> around<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.720> where<00:02:00.870> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
we're having to look around to where to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
we're having to look around to where to
put<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.260> feet<00:02:01.530> into<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.310> channel<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.820> really

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
put my feet into the channel that really

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.500 
put my feet into the channel that really
helps<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:04.080> other<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.740> doing

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
helps the other thing that I'm doing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.150 
helps the other thing that I'm doing
then<00:02:06.510> cut<00:02:06.690> back<00:02:06.720> down<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.740> grabbing<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
then cut back down is I'm grabbing a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.609 
then cut back down is I'm grabbing a
single<00:02:08.550> line<00:02:08.730> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.540> lines<00:02:09.929> me<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.260> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
single line this is what lines me up but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
single line this is what lines me up but
also<00:02:10.800> also<00:02:11.040> I've<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> hand<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.660> above<00:02:12.870> or

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
also also I've got a hand just above or

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
also also I've got a hand just above or
not<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.040> means<00:02:14.220> I'm<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.400> trying<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> grip

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
not so it means I'm not trying to grip

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.660 
not so it means I'm not trying to grip
the<00:02:15.330> ground<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.710> literally<00:02:17.130> it's

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the ground out of it and literally it's

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.550 
the ground out of it and literally it's
fairly<00:02:17.910> relaxed<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.990> my<00:02:19.110> hands<00:02:19.440> aren't

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
fairly relaxed so my hands aren't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.260 
fairly relaxed so my hands aren't
getting<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.040> pumped<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.790> allows<00:02:20.970> me<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
getting really pumped so it allows me to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.810 
getting really pumped so it allows me to
be<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.900> Carla<00:02:22.370> Richter's<00:02:23.370> technique<00:02:23.700> at

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
be with a Carla Richter's technique at

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.440 
be with a Carla Richter's technique at
the<00:02:23.850> top<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> really<00:02:24.450> good<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:25.710> elbow

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
the top is really good so it's an elbow

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.750 
the top is really good so it's an elbow
followed<00:02:27.450> by<00:02:27.540> another<00:02:27.720> elbow<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.100> then<00:02:29.490> as

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
followed by another elbow and then as

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
followed by another elbow and then as
soon<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.240> here<00:02:30.800> depending<00:02:31.800> handed

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
soon as you're here depending handed

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.590 
soon as you're here depending handed
people<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.820> you're<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> pretty<00:02:33.360> safe

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
people on it you're in a pretty safe

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.310
