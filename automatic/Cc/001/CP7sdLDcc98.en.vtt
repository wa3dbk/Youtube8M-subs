okay<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.509> video<00:00:12.690> we're<00:00:12.990> gonna<00:00:13.080> be

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
okay and in this video we're gonna be

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.090 
okay and in this video we're gonna be
doing<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.920> benchmark<00:00:14.580> test<00:00:14.880> between<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.379> HTC

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
doing a benchmark test between the HTC

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400 
doing a benchmark test between the HTC
One<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> galaxy<00:00:18.449> s4<00:00:18.779> when<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.080> put<00:00:19.289> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
One and the galaxy s4 when we put in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
One and the galaxy s4 when we put in
them<00:00:19.500> head-to-head<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:20.010> free<00:00:20.520> benchmark

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
them head-to-head in free benchmark

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
them head-to-head in free benchmark
applications<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.740> know<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:23.100> which

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
applications and just you know see which

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
applications and just you know see which
one<00:00:23.430> comes<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:23.970> top<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.080> they

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
one comes out on top and see how they

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.019 
one comes out on top and see how they
perform<00:00:25.519> remember<00:00:26.519> they're<00:00:26.670> both<00:00:26.789> running

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
perform remember they're both running

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
perform remember they're both running
the<00:00:27.330> same<00:00:27.510> process<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.140> same<00:00:28.650> Snapdragon

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the same process to the same Snapdragon

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.630 
the same process to the same Snapdragon
processor<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.179> once<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.689> s4<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.920> closed

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
processor but once the s4 is closed

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.299 
processor but once the s4 is closed
slightly<00:00:32.880> higher<00:00:33.239> than<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> HTC<00:00:34.469> One<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
slightly higher than the HTC One so I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
slightly higher than the HTC One so I
just<00:00:35.460> offered<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> bear<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.090> mind<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.129> let's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
just offered to bear in mind and let's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.600 
just offered to bear in mind and let's
run<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.550> tests<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.649> did<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> full<00:00:41.190> reboot

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
run these tests I did do a full reboot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
run these tests I did do a full reboot
before<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:43.170> run<00:00:44.129> these<00:00:44.430> tests<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:46.620> open

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
before I run these tests so it's open

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
before I run these tests so it's open
these<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.070> we're<00:00:47.489> gonna<00:00:47.780> do<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> brand<00:00:49.230> new

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
these up we're gonna do it brand new

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.869 
these up we're gonna do it brand new
test<00:00:50.090> scroll<00:00:51.090> across<00:00:52.250> I'm<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.550> start<00:00:54.120> test

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
test scroll across I'm gonna start test

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
test scroll across I'm gonna start test
roughly<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> same<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:58.020> froze

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
roughly about the same time it's froze

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
roughly about the same time it's froze
like<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.430> quicker<00:00:59.699> I'm<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.149> gonna

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like a little bit quicker I'm just gonna

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:44.370 
like a little bit quicker I'm just gonna
let<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.570> run<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.440> postural<00:01:02.129> forward<00:01:02.910> fold

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.490 

okay<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.650> test<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.130> finished<00:01:47.260> as<00:01:48.260> you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
okay so the test is just finished as you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
okay so the test is just finished as you
expect<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.070> s4<00:01:49.490> did<00:01:49.730> score<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.210> bit

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
expect the s4 did score a little bit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.330 
expect the s4 did score a little bit
higher<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:51.650> got<00:01:51.800> 20<00:01:53.200> 4763<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.530> HTC<00:01:54.920> One

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
higher you got 20 4763 on the HTC One

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.990 
higher you got 20 4763 on the HTC One
and<00:01:55.580> then<00:01:56.360> we've<00:01:56.450> got<00:01:56.480> 20<00:01:57.550> 5621<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:58.880> is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and then we've got 20 5621 and it is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.870 
and then we've got 20 5621 and it is
free<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.140> see<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.410> CPU<00:02:01.040> score<00:02:01.370> GPU

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
free and you can see the CPU score GPU

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.330 
free and you can see the CPU score GPU
score<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:02.540> IO<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.440> all<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.040> good<00:02:04.160> stuff

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
score I'm IO and all of that good stuff

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.670 
score I'm IO and all of that good stuff
so<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.300> can<00:02:05.480> just<00:02:05.510> get<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> good<00:02:06.050> idea<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.380> how

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
so you can just get a good idea of how

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.850 
so you can just get a good idea of how
both<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.460> them<00:02:07.730> compare<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.360> there's<00:02:09.260> about

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
both of them compare and there's about

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.070 
both of them compare and there's about
us<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:10.940> I'm<00:02:11.090> know<00:02:11.270> there's<00:02:11.810> about<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
us what I'm know there's about a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
us what I'm know there's about a
thousand<00:02:12.770> difference<00:02:13.280> between<00:02:13.610> them<00:02:13.790> which

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
thousand difference between them which

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.950 
thousand difference between them which
isn't<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:14.990> much<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:17.600> it's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
isn't that much it's kind of but it's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.150 
isn't that much it's kind of but it's
not<00:02:18.080> really<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.500> much<00:02:18.560> when<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:18.980> think

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
not really that much when you think

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.060 
not really that much when you think
about<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.460> basically<00:02:20.450> both<00:02:20.900> devices<00:02:21.230> are<00:02:21.650> more

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
about it basically both devices are more

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.550 
about it basically both devices are more
or<00:02:22.130> less<00:02:22.480> give<00:02:23.480> around<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> same<00:02:24.110> score<00:02:24.440> by

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
or less give around the same score by

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.820 
or less give around the same score by
the<00:02:24.620> s3<00:02:25.010> s4<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.390> slightly<00:02:26.690> higher<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.710> we're

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the s3 s4 is slightly higher now we're

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.780 
the s3 s4 is slightly higher now we're
going<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:27.980> be<00:02:28.070> jumping<00:02:28.340> into<00:02:28.520> another

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
going to be jumping into another

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.190 
going to be jumping into another
application<00:02:29.180> we're<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.780> be<00:02:29.870> jumping

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
application we're going to be jumping

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.690 
application we're going to be jumping
into<00:02:30.320> everybody's<00:02:30.860> favorite<00:02:31.250> quadrant

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
into everybody's favorite quadrant

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.570 
into everybody's favorite quadrant
standard<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.620> we're<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:33.950> gonna<00:02:34.130> run<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> full

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
standard and we're just gonna run a full

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.070 
standard and we're just gonna run a full
bunch<00:02:34.820> more<00:02:35.030> punch<00:02:35.270> park<00:02:35.540> when<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> trial<00:02:35.960> run

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
bunch more punch park when the trial run

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.760 
bunch more punch park when the trial run
is<00:02:36.110> exactly<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.800> same<00:02:36.950> time<00:02:38.410> there<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.560> go

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
is exactly at the same time there you go

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.070 
is exactly at the same time there you go
and<00:02:40.040> never<00:02:40.160> go<00:02:40.430> fast<00:02:40.700> forward<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.420> see

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
and never go fast forward and just see

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.690 
and never go fast forward and just see
what<00:02:42.410> results<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.860> get

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.630 

and<00:02:53.290> bench<00:02:54.290> powers<00:02:54.620> also<00:02:54.830> finished<00:02:55.430> we're

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and bench powers also finished we're

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.729 
and bench powers also finished we're
going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.849> click<00:02:56.180> yes<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.390> proceed<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:59.680> ok<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
going to click yes to proceed and ok so

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.780 
going to click yes to proceed and ok so
the<00:03:01.610> HTC<00:03:02.269> one<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.800> can<00:03:03.890> see<00:03:04.069> me<00:03:04.250> focus<00:03:04.670> on

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the HTC one if you can see me focus on

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.350 
the HTC one if you can see me focus on
ebay<00:03:05.030> HTC<00:03:05.629> One<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.989> 12,000<00:03:07.900> 388<00:03:08.900> which<00:03:09.560> is<00:03:10.360> all

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
ebay HTC One is 12,000 388 which is all

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.360 
ebay HTC One is 12,000 388 which is all
right<00:03:11.660> it's<00:03:12.019> pretty<00:03:12.319> good<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.760> HTC<00:03:14.330> but

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
right it's pretty good the HTC but

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.860 
right it's pretty good the HTC but
samsung<00:03:16.370> galaxy<00:03:16.700> s4<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:18.069> 12,000<00:03:19.569> 259<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
samsung galaxy s4 is 12,000 259 so the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.500 
samsung galaxy s4 is 12,000 259 so the
HTC<00:03:24.739> One<00:03:24.950> actually<00:03:25.340> did<00:03:25.519> score<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> lil<00:03:26.360> bit

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
HTC One actually did score a lil bit

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.320 
HTC One actually did score a lil bit
higher<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.140> test<00:03:27.819> which<00:03:28.819> is<00:03:28.970> strange<00:03:29.209> to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
higher in this test which is strange to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.819 
higher in this test which is strange to
my<00:03:29.540> foot<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:29.900> for<00:03:30.200> would<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.500> been<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.650> bit

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
my foot this for would have been a bit

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.839 
my foot this for would have been a bit
higher<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.340> HTC<00:03:32.120> 11<00:03:33.049> this<00:03:33.200> run<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.860> those<00:03:34.700> are

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
higher but HTC 11 this run so those are

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.190 
higher but HTC 11 this run so those are
the<00:03:34.880> results<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.480> get<00:03:35.630> with<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.959> one

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
the results that you get with this one

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.250 
the results that you get with this one
quadrant<00:03:36.709> standard<00:03:37.930> hopefully<00:03:38.930> they'll<00:03:39.079> give

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
quadrant standard hopefully they'll give

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.440 
quadrant standard hopefully they'll give
you<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.410> good<00:03:39.620> idea<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:41.060> we're<00:03:41.239> just<00:03:41.269> going

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
you a good idea so now we're just going

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.900 
you a good idea so now we're just going
to<00:03:41.630> jump<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.079> last<00:03:42.290> one<00:03:42.590> 3d<00:03:43.250> mark

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.180 

this<00:03:50.870> one<00:03:51.080> I'm<00:03:51.230> not<00:03:51.380> gonna<00:03:51.500> miss<00:03:51.680> about<00:03:51.860> we're

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
this one I'm not gonna miss about we're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.740 
this one I'm not gonna miss about we're
just<00:03:52.340> gonna<00:03:52.460> run<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.790> extreme<00:03:53.210> one<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.600> see

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
just gonna run the extreme one and see

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.140 
just gonna run the extreme one and see
what<00:03:53.780> kind<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.200> results<00:03:54.650> will<00:03:55.010> get<00:03:55.190> touched

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
what kind of results will get touched

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.660 
what kind of results will get touched
another<00:03:56.450> roughly<00:03:57.110> about<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.290> same<00:03:57.350> time<00:03:57.670> and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
another roughly about the same time and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.480 
another roughly about the same time and
as<00:03:59.060> usual<00:03:59.240> fast<00:04:00.050> fully<00:04:00.290> do<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.740> see<00:04:01.370> what

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
as usual fast fully do it and see what

00:04:01.490 --> 00:05:10.100 
as usual fast fully do it and see what
kind<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.700> results<00:04:01.820> we<00:04:02.120> get

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.890 

and<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:12.030> finished<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:12.630> an<00:05:12.930> s4<00:05:13.620> because<00:05:14.900> 6530

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
and just finished so an s4 because 6530

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.770 
and just finished so an s4 because 6530
and<00:05:16.620> on<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.550> HTC<00:05:18.120> One<00:05:18.330> because<00:05:18.630> 6000<00:05:19.880> 499<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.720> you

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
and on a HTC One because 6000 499 so you

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.140 
and on a HTC One because 6000 499 so you
can<00:05:21.960> see<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.200> HTC<00:05:22.740> One<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.130> some<00:05:23.400> benchmark

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
can see the HTC One in some benchmark

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.200 
can see the HTC One in some benchmark
test<00:05:24.450> is<00:05:24.630> right<00:05:24.870> behind<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.650> some<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.640> HTC

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
test is right behind it and some the HTC

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.630 
test is right behind it and some the HTC
One<00:05:27.420> is<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.630> little<00:05:27.930> bit<00:05:28.020> better<00:05:28.140> but<00:05:29.070> hopefully

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
One is a little bit better but hopefully

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.130 
One is a little bit better but hopefully
that<00:05:29.790> gives<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.060> a<00:05:30.090> rough<00:05:30.210> idea<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.600> what<00:05:30.870> kind

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
that gives you a rough idea of what kind

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.990 
that gives you a rough idea of what kind
of<00:05:31.230> speed<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.980> should<00:05:32.160> expect<00:05:32.520> from<00:05:32.670> both<00:05:32.970> of

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
of speed you should expect from both of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.550 
of speed you should expect from both of
these<00:05:33.180> devices<00:05:33.540> and<00:05:33.900> how<00:05:34.050> both<00:05:34.290> of<00:05:34.470> them

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
these devices and how both of them

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.070 
these devices and how both of them
compare<00:05:34.800> when<00:05:35.550> you<00:05:35.640> put<00:05:35.820> them<00:05:35.910> head-to-head

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
compare when you put them head-to-head

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
compare when you put them head-to-head
and<00:05:37.080> yeah<00:05:37.260> that's<00:05:37.440> about<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:37.710> for<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.980> video

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
and yeah that's about it for the video

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.440 
and yeah that's about it for the video
