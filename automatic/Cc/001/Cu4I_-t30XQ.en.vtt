actually an extra small just because I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.479 
actually an extra small just because I
feel<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.050> sizing<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.070> different

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
feel like the sizing is so different

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.340 
feel like the sizing is so different
like<00:03:15.060> these<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.690> much<00:03:15.840> bigger<00:03:16.080> than<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
like these are so much bigger than that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.199 
like these are so much bigger than that
extra<00:03:16.800> small<00:03:17.070> ones<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.730> maybe<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.120> just

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
extra small ones and maybe it's just

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.940

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.810 
but it's just like Hawaiian flowers and
they<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> whole<00:04:43.920> bunch<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.190> colors<00:04:44.490> in<00:04:44.670> it

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
they have a whole bunch of colors in it

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.390 
they have a whole bunch of colors in it
so<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.200> basically<00:04:46.380> go<00:04:46.740> with<00:04:46.890> any<00:04:47.100> top

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
so this can basically go with any top

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.670 
so this can basically go with any top
and<00:04:47.760> then<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.420> have<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:48.840> other<00:04:49.020> one<00:04:49.260> from<00:04:49.470> Rip

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
and then I have this other one from Rip

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.700 
and then I have this other one from Rip
Curl<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.480> this<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.690> triangle<00:04:52.200> bathing<00:04:52.500> suit

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
Curl and this is a triangle bathing suit

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.190 
Curl and this is a triangle bathing suit
but<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.340> strap<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.300> here<00:04:54.360> is<00:04:54.660> super<00:04:54.960> thick

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
but the strap right here is super thick

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.860 
but the strap right here is super thick
so<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.740> gives<00:04:55.920> you<00:04:56.070> like<00:04:56.630> really<00:04:57.630> full

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
so it gives you like really full

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.900 
so it gives you like really full
coverage<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.620> then<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.370> just<00:04:59.550> says<00:04:59.670> Rip<00:04:59.880> Curl

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
coverage and then it just says Rip Curl

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.160 
coverage and then it just says Rip Curl
right<00:05:00.210> there<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.510> there's<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.690> girl<00:05:00.930> like

surfing so that's pretty cool and then

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.520 
surfing so that's pretty cool and then
again<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.450> straps<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:03.990> back<00:05:04.140> are<00:05:04.320> thick

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.760 
again the straps in the back are thick
