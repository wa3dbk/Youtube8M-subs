00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
underneath there we've got this graphite

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
underneath there we've got this graphite
seal<00:00:28.800> system<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.369> they've<00:00:29.519> included

it's a highly rubberized material that
kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.900> sticks<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.470> skin<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.640> creates<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
kind of sticks to the skin and creates a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
kind of sticks to the skin and creates a
seal<00:00:36.690> against<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> water<00:00:38.000> even<00:00:39.000> across<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
seal against the water even across the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020 
seal against the water even across the
shoulders<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.680> highly<00:00:41.100> almost

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
shoulders we have this highly almost

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
shoulders we have this highly almost
like<00:00:42.120> abrasive<00:00:42.420> material<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.230> just

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like abrasive material this just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.810 
like abrasive material this just
prevents<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.449> BCD<00:00:45.449> straps<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.110> slipping

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
keeps in a nice comfortable position

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.250 
keeps in a nice comfortable position
really<00:00:49.739> good<00:00:49.859> idea<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.390> if<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> move<00:00:51.719> further

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
really good idea that if we move further

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
really good idea that if we move further
down<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.859> across<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> chest<00:00:53.870> area<00:00:54.870> we've

towards the cuffs we have this
elliptical<00:01:11.850> seal<00:01:12.570> system<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.229> sorry<00:01:13.590> stitch

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
elliptical seal system of sorry stitch

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
elliptical seal system of sorry stitch
system<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> cuffs<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
system that they put on the cuffs this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
system that they put on the cuffs this
is<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.189> when<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:17.369> putting

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

the suit on with this elliptical stitch

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
the suit on with this elliptical stitch
increases<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> amount<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> surface<00:01:22.680> area

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
increases the amount of surface area

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.469 
increases the amount of surface area
that<00:01:23.130> they've<00:01:23.340> stitched<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.299> the

to make you a bit more visible in the
water<00:02:17.730> let's<00:02:18.730> take<00:02:18.819> another<00:02:18.910> look<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.300> these

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
water let's take another look at these

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.340 
water let's take another look at these
the<00:02:19.810> pre-shaped<00:02:20.200> legs<00:02:21.840> okay<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.230> these

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
the pre-shaped legs okay so then these

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.670 
the pre-shaped legs okay so then these
pre-shaped<00:02:23.920> erm<00:02:24.220> sections<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.000> leg<00:02:25.180> then

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
pre-shaped erm sections on the leg then

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.800 
pre-shaped erm sections on the leg then
these<00:02:26.680> panels<00:02:27.040> are<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.520> behind<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.090> knee

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
these panels are just behind the knee

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.620 
these panels are just behind the knee
specifically<00:02:29.709> cuts<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.310> create<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.850> natural

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
specifically cuts to create a natural

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.870 
specifically cuts to create a natural
curve<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> leg<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.430> wet<00:02:33.580> so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
curve in the in the leg of the wet so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.910 
curve in the in the leg of the wet so
this<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.720> prevents<00:02:35.050> any<00:02:35.200> creasing<00:02:35.770> where

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
this just prevents any creasing where

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.090 
this just prevents any creasing where
obviously<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.340> bend<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.260> obviously<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> no

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
obviously you bend and obviously the no

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.800 
obviously you bend and obviously the no
creases<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> neoprene<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.630> just

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
creases in the in the neoprene is just

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.330 
creases in the in the neoprene is just
going<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.020> increase<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> longevity<00:02:41.950> of

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
going to increase the the longevity of

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.440 
going to increase the the longevity of
the<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:44.430> also<00:02:45.430> included<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> suit<00:02:46.330> as
