00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.289 

and<00:00:06.640> the<00:00:07.640> thing<00:00:07.790> about<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.360> ACOG<00:00:08.780> is<00:00:09.110> that<00:00:10.299> it

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
and the thing about the ACOG is that it

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.090 
and the thing about the ACOG is that it
really<00:00:11.629> hinders<00:00:12.230> your<00:00:13.119> cqb<00:00:14.119> ability<00:00:15.100> because

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
really hinders your cqb ability because

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.609 
really hinders your cqb ability because
it<00:00:16.369> takes<00:00:16.550> so<00:00:16.670> long<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.090> scope<00:00:17.420> in<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.529> you

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
it takes so long the scope in so you

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.130 
it takes so long the scope in so you
really<00:00:18.949> want<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.460> just<00:00:20.240> limit<00:00:20.570> yourself<00:00:20.720> to

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
really want to just limit yourself to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.759 
really want to just limit yourself to
long<00:00:21.470> range<00:00:21.769> encounter<00:00:22.369> as<00:00:22.460> if<00:00:22.580> possible<00:00:23.769> and

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
long range encounter as if possible and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.310 
long range encounter as if possible and
as<00:00:25.640> far<00:00:25.849> as<00:00:25.910> other<00:00:26.240> guns<00:00:26.539> i<00:00:26.839> would<00:00:26.960> recommend

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
as far as other guns i would recommend

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.950 
as far as other guns i would recommend
using<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.769> cog<00:00:28.070> on<00:00:28.329> i<00:00:29.329> definitely<00:00:30.320> use<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.279> on

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
using a cog on i definitely use it on

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.810 
using a cog on i definitely use it on
this<00:00:32.960> gun<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.380> course<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.920> import<00:00:34.370> carbine

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
this gun of course the import carbine

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.810 
this gun of course the import carbine
the<00:00:35.239> m16<00:00:35.810> ak-47<00:00:38.289> liam<00:00:39.289> 60<00:00:39.859> if<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.340> like<00:00:40.520> that

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.529 

being<00:00:43.820> 40<00:00:44.390> of<00:00:44.600> course<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:46.269> that's<00:00:47.269> really

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
being 40 of course and that's really

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.720 
being 40 of course and that's really
about<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.989> there's<00:00:48.859> a<00:00:48.920> few<00:00:49.160> more<00:00:49.370> amount<00:00:49.640> of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
about it there's a few more amount of

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.939 
about it there's a few more amount of
Miss<00:00:49.910> there<00:00:50.210> but<00:00:50.570> that's<00:00:51.140> really<00:00:51.320> all<00:00:51.469> I<00:00:51.559> would

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
Miss there but that's really all I would

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.970 
Miss there but that's really all I would
use<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.219> cog<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:54.579> its<00:00:55.579> really<00:00:55.910> good<00:00:56.059> theme<00:00:56.329> for

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
use a cog for its really good theme for

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.709 
use a cog for its really good theme for
even<00:00:57.980> better<00:00:58.129> than<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.429> g36c<00:00:59.149> even<00:00:59.629> though

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
even better than the g36c even though

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.079 
even better than the g36c even though
its<00:00:59.870> ways<00:01:00.140> more<00:01:00.410> because<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.949> import<00:01:01.339> keeps

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
its ways more because the import keeps

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.590 
its ways more because the import keeps
the<00:01:02.269> same<00:01:02.510> sway<00:01:02.899> as<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.949> 8's<00:01:04.489> with<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.210> ACOG

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the same sway as the 8's with the ACOG

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.789 
the same sway as the 8's with the ACOG
as<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:06.050> does<00:01:06.230> the<00:01:06.260> red<00:01:06.650> dot<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:08.560> but<00:01:09.560> I'm<00:01:09.650> out<00:01:09.770> of

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
as it does the red dot so but I'm out of

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.440 
as it does the red dot so but I'm out of
ammo<00:01:10.040> for<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:10.549> thing<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.090> I'm<00:01:11.210> going<00:01:11.390> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
ammo for that thing so I'm going to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.940 
ammo for that thing so I'm going to
switch<00:01:12.259> it<00:01:12.380> out<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.740> mp5<00:01:13.189> here<00:01:13.810> naked<00:01:14.810> mp5

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950

there's so much cover around here and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560 
there's so much cover around here and
it's<00:01:20.079> hard<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.409> shoot<00:01:20.619> people<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.270> I'm<00:01:22.420> just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
it's hard to shoot people so I'm just

mean it really suffers in flagler games
this<00:02:15.480> wasn't<00:02:15.690> too<00:02:15.989> bad<00:02:16.230> though

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.660 

I<00:02:21.290> was<00:02:21.680> able<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.980> kill<00:02:22.190> people<00:02:22.340> pretty

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
I was able to kill people pretty

I was able to kill people pretty
effectively<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:25.220> see<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> key<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.879> bursting

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
effectively you see the key is bursting

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.339 
effectively you see the key is bursting
with<00:02:28.920> stopping<00:02:29.219> power<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.819> g36c<00:02:30.450> will<00:02:31.140> kill

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
with stopping power the g36c will kill

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.319 
with stopping power the g36c will kill
in<00:02:31.530> three<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.950> four<00:02:32.099> bullets<00:02:32.549> so<00:02:32.849> just<00:02:33.120> fire
