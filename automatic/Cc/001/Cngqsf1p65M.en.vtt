00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and just lay waste to them now this this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.149 
and just lay waste to them now this this
gun<00:02:16.599> as<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.019> see<00:02:17.140> very<00:02:17.500> high<00:02:17.709> or<00:02:17.950> very

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
gun as you can see very high or very

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.130 
gun as you can see very high or very
high<00:02:18.909> fire<00:02:19.239> rate<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.629> a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
high fire rate is a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.860 
high fire rate is a
flat<00:02:20.290> off<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.830> that's<00:02:21.190> expected<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> has<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
flat off so that's expected but it has a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.710 
flat off so that's expected but it has a
better<00:02:23.440> fire<00:02:24.400> rate<00:02:24.670> than<00:02:24.880> most<00:02:25.090> assemblies

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
better fire rate than most assemblies

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.390 
better fire rate than most assemblies
and<00:02:25.990> most<00:02:26.319> rifles<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.750> puts<00:02:29.620> temp<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:30.010> sickly

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and most rifles so it puts temp a sickly

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.090 
and most rifles so it puts temp a sickly
to<00:02:30.580> shame<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.140> thing<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.680> may<00:02:32.890> have

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
to shame but the thing is this may have

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.060 
to shame but the thing is this may have
a<00:02:33.450> bigger<00:02:34.450> clip<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.220> as<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.180> see<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:38.070> go

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
a bigger clip but as you can see you go

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.850 
a bigger clip but as you can see you go
through<00:02:39.100> ammo<00:02:39.610> very<00:02:40.300> very<00:02:40.570> quickly<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.590> if

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
through ammo very very quickly so if

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
through ammo very very quickly so if
you're<00:02:42.100> gonna<00:02:42.160> use<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.780> should<00:02:43.959> have

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
you're gonna use this you should have

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.530 
you're gonna use this you should have
you<00:02:44.709> could<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.160> if<00:02:45.400> your<00:02:45.670> guns<00:02:45.850> or<00:02:46.000> get<00:02:46.420> like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you could like if your guns or get like

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
element or if he does a regular version

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.120 
element or if he does a regular version
then<00:03:35.140> that'll<00:03:35.410> work<00:03:35.500> too<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.989> did<00:03:41.950> have

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
then that'll work too but I I did have

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.330 
then that'll work too but I I did have
another<00:03:42.400> version<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.060> stalker<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.930> was<00:03:44.140> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
another version of the stalker it was a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.979 
another version of the stalker it was a
you<00:03:45.340> know<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> double<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.120> called<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.660> diva

for loaders so I came here to the
friendship<00:04:34.070> gulag<00:04:34.460> usually<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:35.450> would<00:04:35.540> go<00:04:35.750> to

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
friendship gulag usually I would go to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.480 
friendship gulag usually I would go to
fraught<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:37.180> washburn<00:04:38.919> but<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.160> don't<00:04:40.400> have

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
that I'm his character yet so I would

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.159 
that I'm his character yet so I would
normally<00:04:43.220> then<00:04:43.820> go<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.150> opportunity<00:04:44.840> which<00:04:45.020> I

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169

quarters<00:04:54.860> as<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.100> washburn<00:04:55.760> would<00:04:55.970> have<00:04:56.060> been

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
quarters as a washburn would have been

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.969
