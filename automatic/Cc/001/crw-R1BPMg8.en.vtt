hi<00:00:08.849> everyone<00:00:09.120> its<00:00:09.480> Danny<00:00:09.719> all<00:00:10.050> right<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:10.650> today

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
hi everyone its Danny all right so today

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.039 
hi everyone its Danny all right so today
we're<00:00:11.130> gonna<00:00:11.280> discuss<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.940> orchid<00:00:12.570> inertia

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
we're gonna discuss about orchid inertia

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.560 
we're gonna discuss about orchid inertia
now<00:00:13.590> if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> look<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.759> term<00:00:14.969> up<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
now if you look at this term up on the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.120 
now if you look at this term up on the
internet<00:00:15.960> you'll<00:00:16.170> most<00:00:16.379> probably<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.770> find

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
internet you'll most probably not find

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
internet you'll most probably not find
anything<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.150> simply<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.320> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
anything about it simply because this is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.279 
anything about it simply because this is
just<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.490> most<00:00:20.670> suited<00:00:21.060> word<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.900> found

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
just the most suited word that I found

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
just the most suited word that I found
to<00:00:22.949> describe<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> phenomena<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.539> gonna

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to describe the phenomena that I'm gonna

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.779 
to describe the phenomena that I'm gonna
show<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> today<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.550> mean<00:00:26.580> by

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
show you today so what do I mean by

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
show you today so what do I mean by
orchid<00:00:27.449> inertia<00:00:27.720> hope<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
orchid inertia hope you know the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.410 
orchid inertia hope you know the
definition<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.849> inertia

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
definition of inertia

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.110 
definition of inertia
if<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:31.050> I'll<00:00:31.289> post<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.920> link<00:00:32.250> down<00:00:32.550> below

if you don't I'll post a link down below

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
if you don't I'll post a link down below
probably<00:00:33.450> from<00:00:33.600> Wikipedia<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.380> explains

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
probably from Wikipedia which explains

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.729 
probably from Wikipedia which explains
what<00:00:35.219> inertia<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.450> physics<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
what inertia is in physics have you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.740 
what inertia is in physics have you
noticed<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> sometimes<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.210> seem<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> buy<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
noticed that sometimes you seem to buy a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680 
noticed that sometimes you seem to buy a
perfectly<00:00:40.559> healthy<00:00:40.860> orchid<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
perfectly healthy orchid but when you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.470 
perfectly healthy orchid but when you
get<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.020> home<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.829> start<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> very

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
get at home you start to get very

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
get at home you start to get very
shriveled<00:00:45.559> pseudobulbs<00:00:46.559> even<00:00:47.100> though<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
shriveled pseudobulbs even though you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
shriveled pseudobulbs even though you
water<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> hydrate<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> orchid

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
water it and you hydrate the orchid

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
water it and you hydrate the orchid
nothing<00:00:49.590> happens<00:00:49.980> pseudobulbs<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.239> start

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
nothing happens pseudobulbs really start

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
nothing happens pseudobulbs really start
to<00:00:51.570> shrivel<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.469> nothing<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> can

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
to shrivel and there's nothing you can

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
to shrivel and there's nothing you can
do<00:00:53.250> about<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.539> potted

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
do about it and then when you are potted

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
do about it and then when you are potted
you<00:00:55.199> discover<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> roots<00:00:56.430> are

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you discover that all the roots are

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.430 
you discover that all the roots are
actually<00:00:56.699> dead<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.809> wondering<00:00:58.230> how

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
actually dead and you're wondering how

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually dead and you're wondering how
could<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.370> happened<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.359> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
could this have happened because when I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
could this have happened because when I
bought<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.109> week<00:01:01.710> ago<00:01:01.770> two<00:01:02.100> weeks<00:01:02.309> ago<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
bought it a week ago two weeks ago it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.719 
bought it a week ago two weeks ago it
looked<00:01:03.090> perfectly<00:01:03.989> fine<00:01:04.290> did<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.129> something

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
looked perfectly fine did I do something

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.090 
looked perfectly fine did I do something
wrong<00:01:05.760> did<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.299> kill<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.049> am<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.470> killing<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
wrong did I kill it or am i killing it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.609 
wrong did I kill it or am i killing it
in<00:01:08.189> any<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.600> answer<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.049> no<00:01:10.350> you're

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
in any way well the answer is no you're

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
in any way well the answer is no you're
not<00:01:10.770> killing<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
not killing it I think I know it's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.410 
not killing it I think I know it's
happening<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> order<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.970> orchid

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
happening so when you order an orchid

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
happening so when you order an orchid
from<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> store<00:01:16.140> most<00:01:16.590> probably<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.070> orchid

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
from the store most probably that orchid

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
from the store most probably that orchid
spend<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.570> transport<00:01:19.409> depending

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
spend some time in transport depending

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.810 
spend some time in transport depending
where<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.189> came<00:01:20.400> from

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
where it came from

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
where it came from
also<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.509> might<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.049> spent<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.590> time<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
also it might have spent some time in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.270 
also it might have spent some time in
deposits<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> store<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.590> sometimes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
deposits or in the store now sometimes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
deposits or in the store now sometimes
people<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:27.240> water<00:01:27.840> orchids<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
people don't water orchids and the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
people don't water orchids and the
result<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.750> drying<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
result of that is actually drying up of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039 
result of that is actually drying up of
the<00:01:31.920> roots<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> eventually<00:01:33.119> dying<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the roots and eventually dying of the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.770 
the roots and eventually dying of the
roots<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.640> Ora<00:01:35.909> kids<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.479> an

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
roots but because Ora kids have an

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260 
roots but because Ora kids have an
inertia<00:01:37.200> especially<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.820> ones<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> have

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
inertia especially the ones that have

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.840 
inertia especially the ones that have
pseudobulbs<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.350> retain<00:01:40.799> moisture<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pseudobulbs which retain moisture you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
pseudobulbs which retain moisture you
cannot<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> right<00:01:43.649> away

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
cannot really see this right away

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
cannot really see this right away
so<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> orchid<00:01:45.390> has<00:01:45.509> multiple

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so because the orchid has multiple

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.920 
so because the orchid has multiple
pseudobulbs<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.280> feed<00:01:47.700> each<00:01:47.939> other<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pseudobulbs that feed each other that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.109 
pseudobulbs that feed each other that
pass<00:01:49.320> energy<00:01:49.950> from<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> another<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
pass energy from one to another to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
pass energy from one to another to
support<00:01:51.659> flower<00:01:51.960> spikes<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.680> other<00:01:53.310> things

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
support flower spikes or other things

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
support flower spikes or other things
you<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> shriveling

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you don't really see the shriveling

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.249 
you don't really see the shriveling
right<00:01:56.340> away<00:01:56.729> even<00:01:57.450> though<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> roots<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.170> an

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
right away even though the roots of an

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.560 
right away even though the roots of an
orchid<00:01:58.590> might<00:01:58.829> already<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.399> dying<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
orchid might already be dying or it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.450 
orchid might already be dying or it
might<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.140> already<00:02:01.469> dead<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
might be already dead so when you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
might be already dead so when you
purchase<00:02:02.850> an<00:02:02.969> orchid<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.540> might<00:02:03.869> look

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
purchase an orchid it might look

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.410 
purchase an orchid it might look
perfectly<00:02:04.860> fine<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> home

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
perfectly fine and when you get it home

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.449 
perfectly fine and when you get it home
after<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> few<00:02:07.079> days<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> week<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.829> two<00:02:08.039> weeks<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
after a few days a week or two weeks it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.729 
after a few days a week or two weeks it
starts<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> look<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
starts to look like this I don't know if

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559 
starts to look like this I don't know if
you<00:02:10.920> remember<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> circuit<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you remember but the circuit when I

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.470 
you remember but the circuit when I
received<00:02:13.049> it<00:02:13.230> looked<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.219> good<00:02:14.549> I'll<00:02:14.790> post<00:02:15.329> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
received it looked so good I'll post a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420 
received it looked so good I'll post a
picture<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.019> here<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.799> ever<00:02:17.010> since<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.400> got

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
picture right here but ever since I got

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
picture right here but ever since I got
it<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.030> started<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.629> shrivel<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.290> crazy

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it it started to shrivel up like crazy

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.830 
it it started to shrivel up like crazy
no<00:02:20.010> matter<00:02:20.189> how<00:02:20.340> much<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.700> water<00:02:20.939> it<00:02:21.030> things

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
no matter how much I water it things

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.449 
no matter how much I water it things
don't<00:02:22.170> look<00:02:22.379> better<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.159> my<00:02:23.310> only

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
don't look better and my only

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.209 
don't look better and my only
explanation<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.629> roots<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.079> dead<00:02:25.499> but

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
explanation is the roots are dead but

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.369 
explanation is the roots are dead but
because<00:02:26.549> of<00:02:26.579> this<00:02:26.939> inertia<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.079> orchid

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
because of this inertia the orchid

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.459 
because of this inertia the orchid
didn't<00:02:28.620> show<00:02:28.859> signs<00:02:29.189> right<00:02:29.519> away<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:29.849> when<00:02:30.269> I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
didn't show signs right away so when I

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.990 
didn't show signs right away so when I
when<00:02:31.469> you<00:02:31.560> purchase<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.129> regulate<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.670> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
when you purchase and regulate this you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.899 
when you purchase and regulate this you
think<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.780> roots<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.379> perfectly<00:02:34.950> fine<00:02:35.250> when

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
think the roots are perfectly fine when

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.659 
think the roots are perfectly fine when
in<00:02:36.060> fact<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.930> might<00:02:37.319> actually<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.889> very<00:02:38.340> dead

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:38.669 
in fact they might actually be very dead

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.089 
in fact they might actually be very dead
and<00:02:38.939> you<00:02:39.329> cannot<00:02:39.659> see<00:02:39.900> through<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.260> pot<00:02:40.469> so

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
and you cannot see through the pot so

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.429 
and you cannot see through the pot so
the<00:02:41.250> bottom<00:02:41.489> line<00:02:41.669> of<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.120> video<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.749> that<00:02:43.169> if

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
the bottom line of this video is that if

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.740 
the bottom line of this video is that if
something<00:02:43.859> like<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.129> happens<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.060> then

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
something like this happens to you then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.990 
something like this happens to you then
this<00:02:46.109> might<00:02:46.319> be<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.650> explanation<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.519> don't

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
this might be an explanation I don't

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.550 
this might be an explanation I don't
think<00:02:48.209> you're<00:02:48.299> doing<00:02:48.480> anything<00:02:48.719> wrong<00:02:49.290> in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
think you're doing anything wrong in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.520 
think you're doing anything wrong in
most<00:02:49.829> cases<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.819> not<00:02:51.030> gonna<00:02:51.209> generalize<00:02:51.599> but

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
most cases I'm not gonna generalize but

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.520 
most cases I'm not gonna generalize but
in<00:02:52.650> some<00:02:52.980> cases<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:54.359> might<00:02:54.599> have<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.379> deal

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
in some cases you might have to deal

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.470 
in some cases you might have to deal
with<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.769> market<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.280> simply<00:02:57.030> had<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> rough

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
with a market that simply had a rough

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.270 
with a market that simply had a rough
time<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:57.989> transport<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.799> didn't<00:02:59.099> show

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
time on transport and it didn't show

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.670 
time on transport and it didn't show
signs<00:02:59.639> right<00:03:00.000> away<00:03:00.299> most<00:03:00.719> orchids<00:03:01.290> will<00:03:01.439> not

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
signs right away most orchids will not

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.679 
signs right away most orchids will not
show<00:03:01.980> signs<00:03:02.280> right<00:03:02.639> away<00:03:02.849> because<00:03:03.449> they<00:03:03.599> are

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
show signs right away because they are

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.289 
show signs right away because they are
so<00:03:03.870> adapted<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.530> withstand<00:03:04.680> droughts<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:05.969> a

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
so adapted to withstand droughts for a

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.179 
so adapted to withstand droughts for a
period<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.989> time<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:07.859> will<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.159> show

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
period of time that they will not show

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.179 
period of time that they will not show
signs<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:09.120> day<00:03:09.510> prior<00:03:10.199> to<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.799> problem

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
signs a day prior to the problem

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.360 
signs a day prior to the problem
occurring<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:12.269> maybe<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:12.840> week<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.409> two<00:03:14.069> after

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
occurring so maybe a week or two after

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.550 
occurring so maybe a week or two after
all<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.209> roots<00:03:15.389> die<00:03:15.629> you'll<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.290> something

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
all the roots die you'll have something

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.240 
all the roots die you'll have something
like<00:03:16.829> this

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
like this

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.129 
like this
now<00:03:17.699> this<00:03:18.000> doesn't<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.540> mean<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.870> you

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
now this doesn't really mean that you

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.589 
now this doesn't really mean that you
cannot<00:03:19.709> trust<00:03:20.040> orchids<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.699> buy<00:03:20.879> in<00:03:21.180> most

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
cannot trust orchids you buy in most

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.330 
cannot trust orchids you buy in most
cases<00:03:21.989> when<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.409> buy<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.799> very<00:03:23.099> good-looking

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
cases when you buy a very good-looking

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.149 
cases when you buy a very good-looking
orchid<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.870> good<00:03:25.109> sign<00:03:25.409> and<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.829> should

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
orchid it is a good sign and you should

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.490 
orchid it is a good sign and you should
buy<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.599> not<00:03:27.840> one<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.290> has

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
buy that one and not one that has

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.379 
buy that one and not one that has
wrinkly<00:03:28.949> suitable<00:03:29.340> because<00:03:29.699> if<00:03:29.819> you<00:03:29.939> buy<00:03:30.150> one

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
wrinkly suitable because if you buy one

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.929 
wrinkly suitable because if you buy one
that's<00:03:30.659> already<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> stage<00:03:31.799> things<00:03:32.699> are

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
that's already in this stage things are

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.729 
that's already in this stage things are
worse<00:03:33.239> than<00:03:33.269> they<00:03:33.840> were<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.169> beginning

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
worse than they were in the beginning

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.280 
worse than they were in the beginning
let's<00:03:35.069> say<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.879> right<00:03:35.909> now<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.419> path<00:03:36.810> for<00:03:37.139> this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
let's say so right now the path for this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.229 
let's say so right now the path for this
orchid<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.189> cut<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.549> beautiful<00:03:38.970> flower

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
orchid is to cut the beautiful flower

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.110 
orchid is to cut the beautiful flower
spikes<00:03:39.659> and<00:03:39.930> that's<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.849> repotted<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.939> see

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
spikes and that's that repotted to see

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.699 
spikes and that's that repotted to see
what's<00:03:42.299> happening<00:03:42.689> with<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.139> root<00:03:43.319> system

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
what's happening with the root system

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.589 
what's happening with the root system
and<00:03:43.889> go<00:03:44.129> from<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:44.669> try<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> give<00:03:45.479> the

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
and go from there try to give the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.899 
and go from there try to give the
surrogate<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.139> fresh<00:03:46.500> start<00:03:46.859> try<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> remove

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
surrogate a fresh start try to remove

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.149 
surrogate a fresh start try to remove
the<00:03:48.060> flowers<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.689> they<00:03:48.870> don't<00:03:49.229> drain<00:03:49.560> extra

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
the flowers so they don't drain extra

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.849 
the flowers so they don't drain extra
energy<00:03:50.609> from<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.180> already<00:03:51.859> draining

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
energy from the already draining

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.429 
energy from the already draining
pseudobulbs<00:03:53.699> and<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.540> latest<00:03:54.900> video<00:03:55.079> of

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
pseudobulbs and in the latest video of

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.469 
pseudobulbs and in the latest video of
how<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> choose<00:03:56.159> a<00:03:56.370> calla<00:03:56.729> orchid<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.419> do

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
how to choose a calla orchid I do

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.659 
how to choose a calla orchid I do
discuss<00:03:58.019> about<00:03:58.259> this<00:03:58.439> thing<00:03:58.620> with<00:03:59.219> inertia

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
discuss about this thing with inertia

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.909 
discuss about this thing with inertia
with<00:04:00.090> orchids<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.989> doesn't<00:04:01.409> happen<00:04:01.590> all<00:04:01.889> the

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
with orchids it doesn't happen all the

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.219 
with orchids it doesn't happen all the
time<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:02.609> sometimes<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.509> does<00:04:03.719> seem<00:04:04.019> like

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
time but sometimes it does seem like

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.530 
time but sometimes it does seem like
it's<00:04:04.409> happening<00:04:04.889> so<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.639> my<00:04:05.819> explanation

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
it's happening so that is my explanation

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.959 
it's happening so that is my explanation
on<00:04:06.659> things<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.169> is<00:04:07.349> why<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.560> think<00:04:07.879> stuff<00:04:08.879> like

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
on things this is why I think stuff like

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.819 
on things this is why I think stuff like
this<00:04:09.269> happens<00:04:09.689> if<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.169> to<00:04:10.349> deal<00:04:10.500> with<00:04:10.560> an

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
this happens if you have to deal with an

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.259 
this happens if you have to deal with an
orchid<00:04:11.159> like<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.669> best<00:04:11.819> thing<00:04:11.969> you<00:04:12.090> can

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
orchid like this the best thing you can

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.899 
orchid like this the best thing you can
do<00:04:12.419> is<00:04:12.599> remove<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.349> drainage<00:04:13.889> source<00:04:14.219> which

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
do is remove the drainage source which

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.990 
do is remove the drainage source which
are<00:04:15.090> flower<00:04:15.359> spikes<00:04:15.840> cut<00:04:16.620> them<00:04:16.859> from<00:04:17.219> from<00:04:17.849> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
are flower spikes cut them from from the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.759 
are flower spikes cut them from from the
base<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> orchid<00:04:18.750> repot<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.409> orchid

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
base of the orchid repot the orchid

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.140 
base of the orchid repot the orchid
because<00:04:20.070> maybe<00:04:20.280> it's<00:04:20.519> something<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
because maybe it's something in the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.520 
because maybe it's something in the
media

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
media

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.410 
media
that's<00:04:21.980> really<00:04:22.340> killing<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.790> orchid<00:04:23.270> of

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
that's really killing the orchid of

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.210 
that's really killing the orchid of
course<00:04:23.870> if<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.230> roots<00:04:24.440> are<00:04:24.590> dead<00:04:24.830> they<00:04:25.070> will

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
course if the roots are dead they will

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.710 
course if the roots are dead they will
start<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.550> decompose

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
start to decompose

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.510 
start to decompose
they're<00:04:27.020> already<00:04:27.260> decomposing<00:04:27.950> in<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> media

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
they're already decomposing in the media

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.950 
they're already decomposing in the media
it's<00:04:28.760> not<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> good<00:04:29.210> idea<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.630> leave<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
it's not a good idea to leave the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.410 
it's not a good idea to leave the
circuit<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.560> media<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.100> longer<00:04:31.460> remove

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
circuit in this media and longer remove

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.480 
circuit in this media and longer remove
the<00:04:32.630> old<00:04:32.780> media<00:04:33.020> cut<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.620> dead<00:04:33.800> roots<00:04:34.070> give<00:04:34.400> it

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
the old media cut the dead roots give it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.940 
the old media cut the dead roots give it
a<00:04:34.550> fresh<00:04:34.700> start<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.390> you're<00:04:35.930> good<00:04:36.140> to<00:04:36.260> go<00:04:36.290> keep

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
a fresh start and you're good to go keep

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.680 
a fresh start and you're good to go keep
in<00:04:37.100> mind<00:04:37.280> as<00:04:37.430> well<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.760> more<00:04:37.910> suitable<00:04:38.450> you

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
in mind as well the more suitable you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.300 
in mind as well the more suitable you
have<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.020> more<00:04:39.170> energy<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.830> orchid<00:04:40.130> has

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
have the more energy the orchid has

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.730 
have the more energy the orchid has
stopped<00:04:40.910> up<00:04:41.120> removing<00:04:41.810> flowers<00:04:42.260> fights<00:04:42.500> will

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
stopped up removing flowers fights will

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.500 
stopped up removing flowers fights will
save<00:04:42.980> up<00:04:43.130> energy<00:04:43.550> as<00:04:43.670> well<00:04:43.880> mmm

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
save up energy as well mmm

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.930 
save up energy as well mmm
energy<00:04:44.900> management<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.860> that's<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.760> best

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
energy management so that's the best

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.880 
energy management so that's the best
thing<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.270> do<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.660> this<00:04:47.840> type<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.230> orchid

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
thing you can do to this type of orchid

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.860 
thing you can do to this type of orchid
which<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.310> suffering<00:04:49.730> from<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.270> lack<00:04:50.450> of<00:04:50.510> roots

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
which is suffering from a lack of roots

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.980 
which is suffering from a lack of roots
which<00:04:51.170> did<00:04:52.160> not<00:04:52.340> show<00:04:52.640> in<00:04:52.880> time<00:04:53.150> all<00:04:53.600> right<00:04:53.780> so

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990
