00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
because today is the last day we have to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.500 
because today is the last day we have to
work<00:00:09.620> on<00:00:09.800> it<00:00:09.980> so<00:00:10.310> what<00:00:10.520> you've<00:00:10.700> seen<00:00:10.850> so<00:00:11.090> far<00:00:11.120> is

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
work on it so what you've seen so far is

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.150 
work on it so what you've seen so far is
well<00:00:12.260> essentially<00:00:12.620> an<00:00:12.950> entire

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
well essentially an entire

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.820 
well essentially an entire
transformation<00:00:13.700> of<00:00:14.300> tan<00:00:14.780> interior<00:00:14.960> to<00:00:15.620> black

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
transformation of tan interior to black

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.400 
transformation of tan interior to black
interior<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.600> all<00:00:17.600> we're<00:00:17.810> doing<00:00:18.020> today<00:00:18.140> is

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
interior and all we're doing today is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.500 
interior and all we're doing today is
putting<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.950> the<00:00:19.610> black<00:00:19.940> seats<00:00:20.210> because

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
putting in the black seats because

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.940 
putting in the black seats because
that's<00:00:20.840> literally<00:00:21.140> all<00:00:21.260> that<00:00:21.500> we've<00:00:21.590> got<00:00:21.770> left

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
that's literally all that we've got left

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.029 
that's literally all that we've got left
everything<00:00:22.550> tan<00:00:22.880> has<00:00:23.180> either<00:00:23.360> been<00:00:23.480> redone<00:00:24.140> or

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
everything tan has either been redone or

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.160 
everything tan has either been redone or
been<00:00:25.400> taken<00:00:25.760> out<00:00:25.850> and<00:00:26.240> versus<00:00:26.690> breaking<00:00:26.990> stuff

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
been taken out and versus breaking stuff

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.700 
been taken out and versus breaking stuff
over<00:00:27.320> there

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
over there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.490 
over there
so<00:00:27.830> yeah<00:00:28.100> let's<00:00:28.460> go<00:00:28.580> ahead<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.820> get<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.030> it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
so yeah let's go ahead and get to it

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.860 
so yeah let's go ahead and get to it
okay<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:30.560> we're<00:00:31.100> gonna<00:00:31.369> go<00:00:31.580> ahead<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:31.940> put<00:00:32.450> the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
okay so we're gonna go ahead and put the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.580 
okay so we're gonna go ahead and put the
driver<00:00:33.170> seat<00:00:33.470> in<00:00:34.450> these<00:00:35.450> actually<00:00:35.870> were<00:00:36.140> from

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
driver seat in these actually were from

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.380 
driver seat in these actually were from
originally<00:00:37.220> we<00:00:37.340> at<00:00:37.579> least<00:00:37.730> originally<00:00:38.149> from

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
originally we at least originally from

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.540 
originally we at least originally from
an<00:00:38.540> auto<00:00:38.720> sex<00:00:38.989> yes<00:00:39.770> but<00:00:40.070> there<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.520> a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
an auto sex yes but there was to a

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.729 
an auto sex yes but there was to a
Nietzsche<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.360> all<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.690> got<00:00:41.810> to<00:00:41.899> do<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.320> we<00:00:42.590> got

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
Nietzsche so all you got to do is we got

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.590 
Nietzsche so all you got to do is we got
to<00:00:42.770> unbolt<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.430> eg<00:00:43.760> harness<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.329> then<00:00:44.420> put

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
to unbolt the eg harness and then put

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.960 
to unbolt the eg harness and then put
the<00:00:44.720> original<00:00:44.930> harness<00:00:45.530> that's<00:00:45.710> from<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.550> RSX

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
the original harness that's from the RSX

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.299 
the original harness that's from the RSX
and<00:00:47.270> that's<00:00:47.510> Western<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.230> cradle<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.220> know

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
and that's Western a cradle you know

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:02.290 
and that's Western a cradle you know
he's<00:00:49.579> just<00:00:49.700> at<00:00:50.000> least<00:00:50.180> it's<00:00:50.420> not<00:01:00.730> okay<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:01.760> what

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
he's just at least it's not okay so what

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.389 
he's just at least it's not okay so what
we've<00:01:02.450> been<00:01:02.629> doing<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.170> we've<00:01:03.860> been<00:01:03.890> altering

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
we've been doing is we've been altering

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.069 
we've been doing is we've been altering
these<00:01:04.549> because<00:01:04.999> this<00:01:05.179> came<00:01:05.389> out<00:01:05.539> of<00:01:05.659> an<00:01:05.749> eg

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
these because this came out of an eg

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.859 
these because this came out of an eg
like<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.380> said<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.039> what<00:01:07.939> we<00:01:08.030> had<00:01:08.179> to<00:01:08.270> do<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:08.749> we

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
like I said so what we had to do was we

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.580 
like I said so what we had to do was we
had<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.079> take<00:01:09.319> the<00:01:09.729> other<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:11.719> eg<00:01:12.079> harness<00:01:12.409> out

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
had to take the other the eg harness out

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.649 
had to take the other the eg harness out
because<00:01:12.920> well<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.340> had<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.520> fit<00:01:13.759> an<00:01:14.389> EEG

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
because well it had to fit an EEG

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.800 
because well it had to fit an EEG
specifically<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:17.149> then<00:01:17.299> we<00:01:17.479> ended<00:01:17.659> up

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
specifically and then we ended up

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.889 
specifically and then we ended up
modifying<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.529> and<00:01:18.560> putting<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.950> RSX<00:01:19.899> factory

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
modifying it and putting the RSX factory

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.569 
modifying it and putting the RSX factory
you<00:01:21.229> know<00:01:21.259> seat<00:01:21.649> harness<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:22.159> buckle<00:01:22.429> on

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
you know seat harness and buckle on

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.370 
you know seat harness and buckle on
there<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:22.999> we<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:23.509> got<00:01:23.779> a<00:01:23.810> new<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> little

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
there so we just got a new so a little

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.410 
there so we just got a new so a little
bit<00:01:24.529> of<00:01:24.709> modification<00:01:25.279> on<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.939> driver's<00:01:26.270> seat

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
bit of modification on the driver's seat

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.449 
bit of modification on the driver's seat
that's<00:01:26.749> okay<00:01:27.049> we<00:01:27.679> should<00:01:27.859> never<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:28.310> should

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
that's okay we should never we should

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.730 
that's okay we should never we should
never<00:01:28.609> ever<00:01:28.909> say<00:01:29.450> something<00:01:30.200> has<00:01:30.409> been<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.590> bit

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
never ever say something has been a bit

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.279 
never ever say something has been a bit
easy<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:31.999> makes<00:01:32.270> everything<00:01:32.599> terrible

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
easy that just makes everything terrible

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.230

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.389 

do<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.759> little<00:01:47.270> bit<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.539> fabrication<00:01:48.399> that's

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
do a little bit of fabrication that's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.839 
do a little bit of fabrication that's
okay

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
okay

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.359

I did the front first I know you did the
back<00:01:56.029> I'm<00:01:56.840> saying<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.200> undid<00:01:57.529> the<00:01:57.649> Front's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
back I'm saying you undid the Front's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.190 
back I'm saying you undid the Front's
first<00:01:58.159> no<00:01:58.489> I<00:01:58.549> did<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.969> back<00:01:59.149> first<00:01:59.509> then<00:02:00.049> why

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
first no I did the back first then why

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.749 
first no I did the back first then why
was<00:02:00.349> it<00:02:00.380> sitting<00:02:00.679> like<00:02:00.919> this<00:02:01.219> whenever<00:02:01.520> we
