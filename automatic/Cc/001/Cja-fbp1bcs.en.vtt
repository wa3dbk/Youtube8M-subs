00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.130 
around three plan but it's obviously
going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.040> red<00:02:21.190> wings<00:02:21.400> i<00:02:21.550> hope<00:02:21.760> i<00:02:22.140> really

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
going to be red wings i hope i really

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.360 
going to be red wings i hope i really
like<00:02:23.350> Chicago<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:25.590> Detroit<00:02:26.590> might<00:02:27.160> actually

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
like Chicago that Detroit might actually

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.540 
like Chicago that Detroit might actually
win<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> twice<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> row<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:30.130> Hurricanes

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
win it twice in a row and the Hurricanes

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.040 
win it twice in a row and the Hurricanes
are<00:02:30.730> doing<00:02:30.940> pretty<00:02:31.120> good<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.630> predict

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
are doing pretty good so I predict

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.150 
are doing pretty good so I predict
hurricanes<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.150> Detroit<00:02:34.150> round<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:36.070> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
