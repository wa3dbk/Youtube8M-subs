about<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> multi<00:00:13.139> voltage

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
about this is that it's a multi voltage

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.230 
about this is that it's a multi voltage
charger<00:00:13.950> as<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.790> change<00:00:15.150> it
