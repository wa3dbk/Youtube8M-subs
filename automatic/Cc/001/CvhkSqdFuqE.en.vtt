00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
going to show you how to install jelly

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.840 
going to show you how to install jelly
beans<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.080> raspberry<00:00:22.080> pi<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.490> thing

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
beans on a raspberry pi the first thing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.710 
beans on a raspberry pi the first thing
we<00:00:24.359> need<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.680> course<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:28.070> raspberry<00:00:29.070> pi<00:00:29.720> okay

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
we need is of course a raspberry pi okay

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
we need is of course a raspberry pi okay
that's<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.349> bright<00:00:31.769> no<00:00:32.130> sir<00:00:32.430> oh<00:00:32.550> yeah<00:00:32.940> yeah

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that's a bit bright no sir oh yeah yeah

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.680 
that's a bit bright no sir oh yeah yeah
that's<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> necessary<00:00:34.829> hardware<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
that's the necessary hardware a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.170 
that's the necessary hardware a
raspberry<00:00:36.690> pi<00:00:36.750> arm<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
raspberry pi arm and now we want to have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.940 
raspberry pi arm and now we want to have
some<00:00:39.600> jelly<00:00:40.379> bean<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.940> raspberry<00:00:42.210> pi

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
some jelly bean on this raspberry pi

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.139 
some jelly bean on this raspberry pi
fortunately<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:43.980> raspberry<00:00:44.670> pi<00:00:44.700> already

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
fortunately the raspberry pi already

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.869 
fortunately the raspberry pi already
comes<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> convenient<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.879> mounting

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
comes with this convenient a mounting

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.709 
comes with this convenient a mounting
bar<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.899> jelly<00:00:52.379> beans<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.910> next<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bar for jelly beans so the next thing we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.400 
bar for jelly beans so the next thing we
need<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:56.629> actually<00:00:57.770> jelly<00:00:58.770> beans<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:01.289> do

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
need is actually jelly beans so what do

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
need is actually jelly beans so what do
we<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.039> take<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> couple<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.539> jelly

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
we do we take a couple of these jelly

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.560 
we do we take a couple of these jelly
beans<00:01:04.110> oops<00:01:04.769> nearly<00:01:05.159> oh<00:01:05.400> um<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.340> yes<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
beans oops nearly oh um and yes they the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.760 
beans oops nearly oh um and yes they the
mount<00:01:09.780> parts<00:01:10.400> for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.670> jelly<00:01:11.909> beans<00:01:12.180> ie<00:01:13.580> this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
mount parts for the jelly beans ie this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
mount parts for the jelly beans ie this
ok<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.220> life<00:01:17.490> problem<00:01:17.939> yeah<00:01:18.210> it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
ok that's a good life problem yeah it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
ok that's a good life problem yeah it's
a<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.600> tough<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.350> eventually<00:01:20.220> work<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a bit tough to do but eventually work so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.249 
a bit tough to do but eventually work so
see<00:01:21.390> first<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:23.150> they<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.810> second

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
see first one they here we go the second

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
see first one they here we go the second
one<00:01:28.640> uh<00:01:29.640> mainly<00:01:30.299> take<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> clean<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
one uh mainly take a clean one is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
one uh mainly take a clean one is
something<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> red<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.729> comes<00:01:33.030> where

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
something or a red one right comes where

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.429 
something or a red one right comes where
it<00:01:33.780> goes<00:01:33.960> oh<00:01:34.729> here<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.240> blue<00:01:36.659> blue<00:01:37.049> blue

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
goes well with the yellow one ah so yeah

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
goes well with the yellow one ah so yeah
you<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.640> well<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.720> mounted<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> couple<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you see well we mounted a couple of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.530 
you see well we mounted a couple of
these<00:01:48.020> jelly<00:01:49.020> beans<00:01:49.140> are<00:01:50.149> onto<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> jelly

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
these jelly beans are onto the jelly

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
these jelly beans are onto the jelly
bean<00:01:51.780> mount<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.860> Raspberry<00:01:53.250> Pi<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.790> now

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
bean mount of the Raspberry Pi and now

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.450 
bean mount of the Raspberry Pi and now
we<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> jellybeans<00:01:54.840> frequent<00:01:55.320> Oh<00:01:55.460> exactly

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
we have jellybeans frequent Oh exactly

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740 
we have jellybeans frequent Oh exactly
and<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.840> Raspberry<00:01:58.799> Pi<00:01:59.750> supplied

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and now we got a Raspberry Pi supplied

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.649 
and now we got a Raspberry Pi supplied
with<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> couple<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.890> jelly<00:02:02.250> beans<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
with a couple of jelly beans and this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
with a couple of jelly beans and this
concludes<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.439> tutorial<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.340> to
