00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
two things I want to talk about today

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589 
two things I want to talk about today
the<00:00:06.870> first<00:00:07.049> thing<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.950> new<00:00:08.490> Xbox<00:00:09.000> one<00:00:09.330> bundle

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the first thing is a new Xbox one bundle

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.080 
the first thing is a new Xbox one bundle
this<00:00:09.960> bundle<00:00:10.469> comes<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.550> terabyte

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this bundle comes with the one terabyte

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.189 
this bundle comes with the one terabyte
sshd<00:00:13.019> um<00:00:13.969> even<00:00:14.969> though<00:00:15.120> larry<00:00:15.599> herb<00:00:15.929> has

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
sshd um even though larry herb has

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160 
sshd um even though larry herb has
tweeted<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.130> an<00:00:17.279> SSD<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.810> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
tweeted that it's an SSD which it is not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250 
tweeted that it's an SSD which it is not
so<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> comes<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.760> terabyte<00:00:21.260> sshd

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
so it comes with a one terabyte sshd

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
so it comes with a one terabyte sshd
which<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> solid-state<00:00:23.760> hybrid<00:00:24.330> drive

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
which is a solid-state hybrid drive

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
which is a solid-state hybrid drive
we'll<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.260> later<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.490> also

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we'll get into that later and it also

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210 
we'll get into that later and it also
comes<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.449> elite<00:00:27.869> controller<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
comes with the elite controller and this

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
comes with the elite controller and this
bundle<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.240> five<00:00:30.480> hundred<00:00:30.929> dollars

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
bundle is going for five hundred dollars

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
bundle is going for five hundred dollars
now<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.399> price<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:32.910> elite

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
now if you look at the price of an elite

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299 
now if you look at the price of an elite
controller<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> price<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.559> Xbox<00:00:34.800> one

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
controller in the price of an Xbox one

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.340 
controller in the price of an Xbox one
it<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.090> adds<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:37.170> getting

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it kind of adds up and you're getting

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.310 
it kind of adds up and you're getting
the<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:37.829> terabyte<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> storage<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the one terabyte of storage so I think I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
the one terabyte of storage so I think I
mean<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.160> deal<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.300> could

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
mean it's a good deal I think they could

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.500 
mean it's a good deal I think they could
have<00:00:42.600> went<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.440> fifty<00:00:44.120> instead<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> five

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have went for fifty instead of five

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
have went for fifty instead of five
hundred<00:00:45.719> dollars<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
hundred dollars on this and it would be

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
hundred dollars on this and it would be
a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.730> more<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.390> value<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
a little bit more of a value for your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
a little bit more of a value for your
money<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.039> there's<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
money but there's a little bit of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
money but there's a little bit of
confusion<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.870> Larry<00:00:52.620> herb<00:00:52.920> tweeted

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
confusion going on Larry herb tweeted

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
confusion going on Larry herb tweeted
out<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.059> SSD<00:00:54.570> inside<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
out that it's an SSD inside of there and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.119 
out that it's an SSD inside of there and
it<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> solid-state<00:00:58.410> hybrid

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it is not it's it's a solid-state hybrid

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.510 
it is not it's it's a solid-state hybrid
drive<00:00:59.430> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> solid-state<00:01:01.440> drive

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
drive which is not a solid-state drive

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
drive which is not a solid-state drive
so<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> difference<00:01:02.969> between<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.300> solid-state

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so the difference between a solid-state

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
so the difference between a solid-state
drive<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.739> regular<00:01:05.129> hard<00:01:05.369> drive<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
drive and a regular hard drive is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.929 
drive and a regular hard drive is
basically<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> solid-state<00:01:07.409> drive<00:01:07.439> has<00:01:08.430> no

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
basically a solid-state drive has no

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
basically a solid-state drive has no
moving<00:01:09.210> parts<00:01:09.470> storage<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.710> provided<00:01:11.220> by

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
moving parts storage is provided by

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300 
moving parts storage is provided by
memory<00:01:11.700> chips<00:01:11.930> instead<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.110> spinning<00:01:13.650> magnets

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
memory chips instead of spinning magnets

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.230 
memory chips instead of spinning magnets
and<00:01:14.580> things<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and things like that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.590 
and things like that
that<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.930> inside<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.530> hard<00:01:16.740> drive<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.939> use

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that are inside of a hard drive so I use

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
that are inside of a hard drive so I use
an<00:01:18.840> SSD<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.799> operating<00:01:20.310> system<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> few

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
an SSD for my operating system and a few

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020 
an SSD for my operating system and a few
other<00:01:21.299> things<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.960> PC<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.310> insanely

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
other things on my PC and it's insanely

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
other things on my PC and it's insanely
fast<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.720> that's<00:01:24.869> why<00:01:25.080> people<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.860> SSDs

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
fast and that's why people get SSDs

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.780 
fast and that's why people get SSDs
which<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.509> crazy<00:01:27.810> expensive<00:01:28.280> it's<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.520> two

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
which are crazy expensive it's like two

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.100 
which are crazy expensive it's like two
hundred<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> fifty<00:01:30.479> three<00:01:30.720> hundred<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
hundred and fifty three hundred and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.249 
hundred and fifty three hundred and
fifty<00:01:31.470> dollars<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.159> good<00:01:32.490> SSD<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.630> good<00:01:33.930> 500

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
fifty dollars for a good SSD a good 500

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.340 
fifty dollars for a good SSD a good 500
gigabyte<00:01:35.250> SSD<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> other<00:01:36.869> hand<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
gigabyte SSD and on the other hand you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.710 
gigabyte SSD and on the other hand you
can<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.310> terabyte<00:01:38.640> regular<00:01:39.420> hard

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
can get a one terabyte regular hard

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.460 
can get a one terabyte regular hard
drive<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.650> easily<00:01:41.189> under<00:01:41.549> $100<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.229> see

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
drive for easily under $100 so you see

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
drive for easily under $100 so you see
the<00:01:43.649> difference<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:45.060> SSD

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the difference and that's because an SSD

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.859 
the difference and that's because an SSD
is<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.200> faster<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> performs<00:01:47.430> better<00:01:47.869> they

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is much faster it performs better they

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.800 
is much faster it performs better they
last<00:01:49.229> longer<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:51.030> OS<00:01:51.479> my

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
last longer when I have my OS my

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.560 
last longer when I have my OS my

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
PC literally boots up in about five

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
PC literally boots up in about five
seconds<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> installed<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
seconds when I have it installed on a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.700 
seconds when I have it installed on a
hard<00:01:59.009> drive<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.520> takes<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.119> 30<00:02:00.570> seconds<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
hard drive it takes about 30 seconds so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.880 
hard drive it takes about 30 seconds so
the<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.430> speed<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.030> crazy<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.560> games

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the the speed is crazy if you have games

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
the the speed is crazy if you have games
installed<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:05.969> SSD<00:02:06.390> loading<00:02:07.079> screens<00:02:07.439> are

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
installed on an SSD loading screens are

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
installed on an SSD loading screens are
faster<00:02:07.710> everything<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.030> runs<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.810> lot<00:02:10.020> faster

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
faster everything just runs a lot faster

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
faster everything just runs a lot faster
I'm<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> game<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.670> game<00:02:11.849> still<00:02:12.150> performs

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
I'm not the game the game still performs

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
I'm not the game the game still performs
the<00:02:13.830> hardware<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.460> but<00:02:15.270> anything<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the hardware you have but anything that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.010 
the hardware you have but anything that
accesses<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.980> SSD<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.240> loading<00:02:18.690> screens

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
accesses the SSD like loading screens

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.680 
accesses the SSD like loading screens
and<00:02:19.260> stuff<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.800> will<00:02:20.100> go<00:02:20.400> faster<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.660> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and stuff like that will go faster so I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420 
and stuff like that will go faster so I
think<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.050> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.350> shady<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.950> Larry<00:02:23.220> herb

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
think it's kind of shady that Larry herb

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
think it's kind of shady that Larry herb
tweeted<00:02:23.820> out<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.210> comes<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.570> an<00:02:24.690> SSD<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
tweeted out that it comes with an SSD I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
tweeted out that it comes with an SSD I
think<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> people<00:02:26.550> are<00:02:26.760> too

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
think they think that people are too

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.310 
think they think that people are too
stupid<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> difference<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
stupid to know the difference and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320 
stupid to know the difference and
basically<00:02:29.310> an<00:02:29.400> sshd

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
basically an sshd

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.080 
basically an sshd
which<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.260> what<00:02:31.620> comes<00:02:31.980> with<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.490> 1<00:02:32.700> terabyte

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
which is what comes with this 1 terabyte

which is what comes with this 1 terabyte

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
little bit of solid-state storage but

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000 
little bit of solid-state storage but
other<00:02:39.630> than<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.260> still<00:02:40.530> your<00:02:40.680> normal

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
other than that it's still your normal

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.920 
other than that it's still your normal
hard<00:02:41.190> disk<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.640> still<00:02:41.880> needs<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.270> spin<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
hard disk it still needs to spin up to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
hard disk it still needs to spin up to
access<00:02:43.410> things<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.010> stuff<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.000> guys

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
access things and stuff like that guys

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.370 
access things and stuff like that guys
so<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:47.360> SSD<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.990> other<00:02:49.140> than

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so it's really not SSD but other than

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.590 
so it's really not SSD but other than
that<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.770> think<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.490> good<00:02:50.670> bundle<00:02:51.330> like

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that I do think it's a good bundle like

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.210 
that I do think it's a good bundle like
I<00:02:51.780> said<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.020> think<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.410> could<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.650> been<00:02:52.770> 50

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
I said I think it could have been 50

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.070 
I said I think it could have been 50
dollars<00:02:53.550> cheaper<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.270> would<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.810> be

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
dollars cheaper and you would really be

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.650 
dollars cheaper and you would really be
getting<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> good<00:02:55.530> value<00:02:55.740> here<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.090> 500

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
getting a good value here but it's 500

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.180 
getting a good value here but it's 500
dollars<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> comes<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.890> elite

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
dollars and it comes with the elite

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.430 
dollars and it comes with the elite
