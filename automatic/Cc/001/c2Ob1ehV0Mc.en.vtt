00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 good morning dolls today I'm going 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 to teach how to make this invitation 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 of a recipe thanks now I'm going to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.530
 explain that in order to perform this 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.019
 standardization must be taken into account 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.780
 many points this standardization is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.900
 adjusts to your own needs 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.000
 that be something uniform the end result 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 it has to be the same is to say that the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 flavor always be the same has to go 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 explicit the name of the recipe in the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400
 top down you have to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 specify a number of servings to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 right side should go the the weight by 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 Europlaza portion and the recipe fish in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.320
 the lower part of life written the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 amount of food that we are going to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 use to his right side to live 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 unit of measure beside ingredients 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.399
 new procedure new critical point 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 puntocom point against the critic and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 finally cost of the recipe is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.190
 It is necessary for the unit of measurement to be 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.170
 find grams with fire meters 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.350
 cubic which equals the same as in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.079
 grams so remember if you do not have 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 in grams it performs conversions so that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.070
 the time to prepare your dish 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.909
 food is much easier when 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 you have placed 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.450
 and there the brand unit is transformed 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.679
 the metric system that suits you the most 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.060
 preferably grams has to 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.609
 write the procedure with words 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 clear you do not have to write everything a 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.959
 single word is understood and a point 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.789
 of control you must place the temperature 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.709
 I wanted her to reach the point of 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.920
 critical control is that it can damage the 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.290
 product of this temperature 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.390
 now how do you know the number of 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.210
 positions 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 and the question here is how to get the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.470
 weight of the recipe then simple add up 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.630
 all the ingredients that are going to be 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 used in the preparation and that are 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.590
 groceries 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.780
 then with this amount you can already 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.970
 develop the other operations and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.340
 take out a number that must be integer not 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.460
 with decimals as the costs stand out 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.979
 in the standard recipe only goes to 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.380
 use 500 grams and it will effect a 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.710
 rule of three all costs are added 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 and get a total cost and cost per 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.280
 portion is divided the total cost of the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 recipe by the number of servings of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.360
 equals in two formulas these two 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 formulas will help you replace the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.810
 number of portions in the event that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.060
 someone wants more portions can be 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.560
 place emplazar in the formula and this 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.720
 number has to be multiplied to 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.590
 all the amounts so I can have 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.590
 a new price 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.210
 no no
