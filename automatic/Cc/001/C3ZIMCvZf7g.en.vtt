00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.650
 shocked and a half thousand rubles but for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.500
 This I do not know just give money 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.590
 sorry and read a lot on the Internet such 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.840
 articles there pages and how can I clean 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.160
 someone cleans the can there but I decided 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 make a nozzle cleaning stand 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.800
 here he is my beauty is going to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 and I want to tell you that if someone 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 also wants the same stand to assemble a stand 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.960
 consists of tens of tubes itself 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.030
 frame here is sheet iron 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 simple iron which was even 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 suspension we used simple 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 normal road sign painted all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:11.640
 this is a good red to warm well and myself 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.689
 device on the tramp was bought stuffy 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.119
 for 500 rubles and bought along with these 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.390
 nozzles 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:27.180
 on avito ramp 16 clap on dozens 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.259
 fuel filter in my rubles two hundred 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.490
 fifty or one hundred fifty incomplete 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.369
 hoses 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 washer fluid reservoir 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.860
 nozzles in the six from the classics and all 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 it will be powered by this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.540
 transformer buck it from 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:55.159
 of some kind of TV here is the fuel pump itself 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.890
 also 500 rubles worth a filter 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.960
 tee hoses from lange were and and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 pressure regulator here are the priors 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.819
 but this is so got a lie 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.050
 here we are rocking of course everything is bad 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:18.700
 did he come it come narrow he 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.370
 and here is the scheme itself here is the scheme itself here 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.830
 here we have a simple one 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 relyushka 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.280
 gasoline pump to gasoline pump 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.360
 radiators scheme itself spent stock finding 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.920
 and do 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.980
 LEDs so here it is inserted 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.440
 nozzle we have inserted all four pieces 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.930
 and volumetric flasks on the Internet 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.930
 but here I am inserted now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:03.670
 made as clearly visible everything is visible 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.879
 even up to 71 max and yes you can see 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.120
 here is the dimension measuring cup such 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:17.230
 measuring cylinder and it's all standing here 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:18.250
 so everyone and everything seems to be good for us who else 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.970
 in the process 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.349
 muslin and another video where it will be 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.959
 precision piece together in a bunch will collect and 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:33.280
 let's go tell me to show more precisely 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.099
 And about the size of a very long thought with 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.290
 friend about sizes like anything at all 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.720
 I do not know to do well, and basically we 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.989
 It turned out so here we have 50 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.849
 centimeters is the width of the stand here 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:53.590
 we have a height of 35 width here this mouse 20 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.110
 parts and widths of this part here 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:03.460
 It turned out 30 centimeters that is 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:06.960
 out 50 cm 50 55 well, in principle, this 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.910
 a box that's enough for everything 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.920
 even a big one seems to me possible 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.590
 would do without it decided well as the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.590
 will make how the service cost such 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:27.100
 these will be up to you no flasks 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.460
 turned out to be very expensive bought for a thousand 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.750
 rubles almost with delivery cost thousands 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.840
 rubles but I think that's all 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.620
 pays off because so if the price is such 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 auto repair it gathered for one 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.290
 familiar 2 yes and about the video video will 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.740
 three is that is this is the first second we 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.320
 we'll shoot everything when we collect 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.140
 and tell you how everything is where the system comes from 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.410
 more detailed assembly time and in the third 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.229
 the video will be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.660
 my friend will come and we will shoot and 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.940
 clean the nozzles it was all people themselves 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.940
 the very first of the West everything is like in principle 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.470
 the whole process she priori wanted 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:20.140
 clean now not in our garage 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.060
 the end left but basically everything is now 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.840
 We will collect and type news to shoot 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.840
 until
