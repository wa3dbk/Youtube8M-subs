our mission for the gen 5 Viper was to
build<00:00:06.059> the<00:00:06.269> best<00:00:06.479> Viper<00:00:06.779> yet<00:00:08.090> that's<00:00:09.090> easy<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
build the best Viper yet that's easy to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.780 
build the best Viper yet that's easy to
say<00:00:09.599> but<00:00:09.809> that's<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.320> real<00:00:10.530> challenge<00:00:10.640> from<00:00:11.640> an

that's been asked a lot is is the new

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.319 
that's been asked a lot is is the new
Viper<00:00:39.310> based<00:00:39.790> on<00:00:40.650> Fyodor<00:00:41.650> Maserati<00:00:42.610> or<00:00:42.790> an

Alfa<00:00:43.750> 8c<00:00:43.930> was<00:00:44.650> speculated<00:00:45.460> early<00:00:45.760> on<00:00:46.079> well<00:00:47.079> the

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
Alfa 8c was speculated early on well the

Alfa 8c was speculated early on well the
truth<00:00:47.859> is<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.550> course<00:00:49.210> we<00:00:49.870> looked<00:00:50.079> at<00:00:50.199> some<00:00:50.379> of

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
truth is of course we looked at some of

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.369 
truth is of course we looked at some of
those<00:00:50.559> options<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:52.329> always<00:00:52.539> been<00:00:52.719> a<00:00:52.930> front

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
those options it's always been a front

mid-engine v10 and and it's had a
certain<00:00:57.100> classic<00:00:57.730> proportion<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.390> was

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
certain classic proportion that was

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.900 
certain classic proportion that was
essential<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.410> car<00:00:59.620> right<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.129> long<00:01:00.370> hood

small cockpit appearances is a key part

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.780 
small cockpit appearances is a key part
of<00:01:04.239> what<00:01:04.390> Viper<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.900> Viper<00:01:05.560> also<00:01:06.100> has<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.400> very

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
of what Viper is Viper also has a very

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.180 
of what Viper is Viper also has a very
low<00:01:07.090> cowell<00:01:07.690> height<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.800> windshield

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
low cowell height so that the windshield

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.770 
low cowell height so that the windshield
sits<00:01:09.460> very<00:01:09.640> low<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.240> overall<00:01:10.480> height<00:01:10.690> of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
sits very low and the overall height of

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.830 
sits very low and the overall height of
the<00:01:10.840> vehicle<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.230> very<00:01:11.440> low<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.090> frankly<00:01:13.090> when

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the vehicle is very low and frankly when

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.210 
the vehicle is very low and frankly when
we<00:01:13.960> looked<00:01:14.110> at<00:01:14.230> some<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.500> other<00:01:14.530> platforms

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
we looked at some of the other platforms

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.790 
we looked at some of the other platforms
they<00:01:15.400> they<00:01:15.820> wouldn't<00:01:16.180> work<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:16.720> for<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.560> Viper

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
they they wouldn't work with for a Viper

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.520 
they they wouldn't work with for a Viper
so<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:18.759> at<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.090> end<00:01:19.119> of<00:01:19.390> those<00:01:19.540> studies<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
so so at the end of those studies the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
so so at the end of those studies the
team<00:01:20.770> realized<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.700> need<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.119> keep<00:01:22.390> our<00:01:22.540> unique

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
team realized we need to keep our unique

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.640 
team realized we need to keep our unique
space<00:01:24.939> frame<00:01:25.299> architecture<00:01:26.079> underneath<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
space frame architecture underneath the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.160 
space frame architecture underneath the
Viper<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.939> it's<00:01:28.090> lighter<00:01:28.360> it's<00:01:28.600> stiffer

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
Viper because it's lighter it's stiffer

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.190 
Viper because it's lighter it's stiffer
and<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.890> achieves<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.970> essence<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.990> Viper

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and it achieves the essence of the Viper

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.870 
and it achieves the essence of the Viper
proportions<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.280> always<00:01:33.490> been<00:01:33.640> there

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
proportions that have always been there

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.819 
proportions that have always been there
and<00:01:34.060> were<00:01:34.149> essential<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.409> looks

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
and were essential to the to the looks

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.990 
and were essential to the to the looks
of<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.100> Viper<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:37.590> key<00:01:38.590> objective<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:39.340> building

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
lightest Viper ever how did we do this

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.920 
lightest Viper ever how did we do this
well<00:01:45.670> first<00:01:45.939> well<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.299> outside<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
car we've we've designed and added a

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.289 
car we've we've designed and added a
bunch<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.229> new<00:01:50.380> carbon<00:01:50.829> fiber<00:01:51.100> pieces<00:01:51.670> the

bunch of new carbon fiber pieces the

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
bunch of new carbon fiber pieces the
biggest<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.049> most<00:01:53.079> visible<00:01:53.560> piece<00:01:53.920> is

biggest and the most visible piece is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.560 
biggest and the most visible piece is
we've<00:01:55.299> added<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:56.079> carbon<00:01:56.619> fiber<00:01:56.890> hood<00:01:57.340> which<00:01:58.329> is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
we've added a carbon fiber hood which is

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.240 
we've added a carbon fiber hood which is
probably<00:01:59.049> one<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.530> biggest<00:01:59.770> carbon

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.250 
extruded aluminum and cast magnesium
components<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:23.220> create<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.730> frame<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.690> 30

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
components to create a frame that is 30

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.339 
components to create a frame that is 30
pounds<00:02:25.800> lighter<00:02:26.099> than<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> old<00:02:26.730> frame<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
pounds lighter than the old frame and

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.110 
pounds lighter than the old frame and
fifty<00:02:28.349> percent<00:02:28.530> stiffer<00:02:29.099> than<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.670> old<00:02:29.790> frame

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
fifty percent stiffer than the old frame

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.720 
fifty percent stiffer than the old frame
so<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.690> gives<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> lighter<00:02:31.890> faster<00:02:32.280> car

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
so that gives you a lighter faster car

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.820 
so that gives you a lighter faster car
but<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.000> also<00:02:33.150> gives<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> car<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.380> more

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
but it also gives you a car with more

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280 
but it also gives you a car with more
with<00:02:35.400> its<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.849> stiffer<00:02:36.269> platform<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.170> have

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
with its a stiffer platform so you have

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
with its a stiffer platform so you have
more<00:02:37.530> confidence<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> handling<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
more confidence in the handling and and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.300 
more confidence in the handling and and
we<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:40.110> most<00:02:40.440> buyers<00:02:40.709> will<00:02:41.040> immediately
