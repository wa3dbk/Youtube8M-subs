you hold a to fly up and you press the
right<00:01:45.170> joystick<00:01:45.650> in<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:47.060> fly<00:01:47.210> down<00:01:47.330> you

the right joystick you press it in to go
down<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.900> that's<00:01:54.080> very<00:01:54.170> annoying<00:01:54.650> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.250 
down I think that's very annoying to
Pratap<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.580> press<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> right<00:01:56.180> joystick<00:01:56.510> but

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
Pratap to press the right joystick but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.219 
Pratap to press the right joystick but
it<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.070> works<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.360> last<00:01:59.540> thing<00:01:59.720> to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
it it but it works so the last thing to

it it but it works so the last thing to
fly<00:02:00.710> really<00:02:01.010> fast<00:02:01.159> instead<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.060> slow<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.810> do
