and<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.420> surprised<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.290> how<00:00:49.620> much

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and I was actually surprised on how much

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.860 
and I was actually surprised on how much
stuff<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.790> was<00:00:50.940> getting<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> how

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
stuff I was getting from them and how

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
stuff I was getting from them and how
quickly<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> decided<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
quickly it was so I decided to do this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
quickly it was so I decided to do this
video<00:00:54.890> you're<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.070> gonna<00:00:56.220> run<00:00:56.460> back<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
video you're just gonna run back and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.959 
video you're just gonna run back and
forth<00:00:57.329> along<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> bridge<00:00:57.989> killing<00:00:58.469> these

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
forth along the bridge killing these

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
forth along the bridge killing these
slimes<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:01.200> uh<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.920> can't<00:01:02.790> remember

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
slimes and these uh I can't remember

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.639 
slimes and these uh I can't remember
what<00:01:03.090> they're<00:01:03.210> called<00:01:03.440> whatever<00:01:04.440> these

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
what they're called whatever these

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.520 
what they're called whatever these
little<00:01:04.979> ender<00:01:05.729> dragon<00:01:06.240> type<00:01:06.390> things<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
little ender dragon type things are just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.139 
little ender dragon type things are just
keep<00:01:07.680> killing<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.040> they're<00:01:08.759> gonna<00:01:08.880> drop

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
keep killing them they're gonna drop

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.630 
keep killing them they're gonna drop
iron<00:01:09.450> loot<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.440> got<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.950> diamond

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
iron loot and I even got a diamond

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
iron loot and I even got a diamond
chestplate<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.300> this<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:13.500> never

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
chestplate from this one I had never

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.139 
chestplate from this one I had never
gotten<00:01:13.890> diamond<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.640> before<00:01:14.940> but<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
gotten diamond from here before but I

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.850 
gotten diamond from here before but I
guess<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.509> possible<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.140> its<00:01:16.350> low-level

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
guess it's possible with its low-level

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.370 
guess it's possible with its low-level
diamond<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.510> what<00:01:18.659> I'm<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.350> now

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
diamond so what I'm gonna do right now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
diamond so what I'm gonna do right now
is<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.610> ahead<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
is I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.000 
is I'm going to go ahead and
fast-forward<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.659> collect<00:01:24.659> some<00:01:24.780> stuff

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
fast-forward this and collect some stuff

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.550 
fast-forward this and collect some stuff
once<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.520> full<00:01:26.970> inventory<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:28.170> gonna<00:01:28.409> go

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
once I get a full inventory I'm gonna go

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.320 
once I get a full inventory I'm gonna go
and<00:01:28.650> sell<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.010> and<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:29.700> much<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.060> get

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
and sell it and see how much I get

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.140 
and sell it and see how much I get
I'm<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:31.049> timing<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.010> you'll<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.850> able<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I'm also timing it so you'll be able to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
I'm also timing it so you'll be able to
know<00:01:33.380> exactly<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:34.470> long<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> took<00:01:35.070> me<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> get

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
know exactly how long it took me to get

00:01:35.460 --> 00:02:21.580 
know exactly how long it took me to get
all<00:01:35.610> that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.840 

so<00:02:22.590> while<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> speeding<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.580> wanted<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
so while this is speeding up I wanted to

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.550 
so while this is speeding up I wanted to
talk<00:02:23.970> real<00:02:24.330> quick<00:02:24.570> about<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.900> contest<00:02:25.380> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
talk real quick about the contest that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.130 
talk real quick about the contest that
we<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> channel<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.870> rules

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
we have going for the channel the rules

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.130 
we have going for the channel the rules
to<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.400> guess<00:02:30.060> how<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.420> doing<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.900> far

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
to it and I guess how it's doing so far

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
to it and I guess how it's doing so far
so<00:02:32.090> basically<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> rules<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.920> need

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
so basically just the rules are you need

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.950 
so basically just the rules are you need
to<00:02:35.310> get<00:02:35.460> people<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.000> subscribe<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
to get people to subscribe to the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.460 
to get people to subscribe to the
channel

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
channel

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.260 
channel
they<00:02:37.620> can't<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.160> comment<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.760> username

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
they can't just comment you username

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.750 
they can't just comment you username
they<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.900> actually<00:02:40.620> subscribe<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
they have to actually subscribe for it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.780 
they have to actually subscribe for it
to<00:02:41.880> count<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:44.030> once<00:02:45.030> they<00:02:45.210> do<00:02:45.270> subscribe<00:02:46.050> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
to count and once they do subscribe and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.610 
to count and once they do subscribe and
