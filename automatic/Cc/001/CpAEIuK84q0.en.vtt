there are a few panels that just make me
stop<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:00.930> my<00:05:00.960> tracks<00:05:01.110> while<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.040> try<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.370> find

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
stop in my tracks while I try to find

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.580 
stop in my tracks while I try to find
all<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.240> references<00:05:03.870> jokes<00:05:04.320> and

all of the little references jokes and

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.830 
all of the little references jokes and
characters<00:05:05.250> for<00:05:05.940> some<00:05:06.090> readers<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.660> might

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
characters for some readers this might

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.629 
characters for some readers this might
be<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:06.990> downside<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.650> can<00:05:08.070> see<00:05:08.190> how<00:05:08.310> something

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
be a downside I can see how something

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.890 
be a downside I can see how something
like<00:05:08.760> this<00:05:08.820> would<00:05:09.180> pull<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.540> out<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.780> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
like this would pull you out of the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.320 
like this would pull you out of the
story<00:05:10.139> but<00:05:10.590> for<00:05:10.830> me<00:05:10.979> these<00:05:11.400> comics<00:05:11.820> are<00:05:11.970> always

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
story but for me these comics are always

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330 
story but for me these comics are always
way<00:05:12.540> too<00:05:12.570> short<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.410> this<00:05:13.560> serves<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.950> lengthen

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
way too short so this serves to lengthen

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.760 
way too short so this serves to lengthen
the<00:05:14.490> experience<00:05:15.090> just<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.419> tiny<00:05:15.630> bit<00:05:15.750> more<00:05:16.110> so
