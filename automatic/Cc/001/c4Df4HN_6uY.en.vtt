one like that okay then add another
keyframe<00:01:50.119> drop

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
keyframe drop

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.249 
keyframe drop
okay<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.200> create<00:01:52.979> another<00:01:53.509> one<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:54.810> going

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
another one and one Brits squished

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.360 
another one and one Brits squished
because<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.870> technique<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:43.220> it's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
because it's a technique because it's

like<00:02:43.520> bouncing<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.270> make<00:02:50.510> its

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
like bouncing then just just make its

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:18.860 
like bouncing then just just make its
altitude<00:02:52.160> low<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:56.660> like

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.479 

and<00:03:19.200> there<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.819> can<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:22.190> file<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and there now you can go to file and
