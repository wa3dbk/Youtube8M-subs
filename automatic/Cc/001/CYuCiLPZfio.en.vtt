00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.690
 Loquendo and if any error is found

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.000
 comments how can I improve good in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 this video will show you several series 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.790
 short films and videos of the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.830
 cartoons that until now for me are 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.090
 the most disturbing and partly 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.090
 Mysterious I've seen 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.790
 number 1 salad fingers salad fingers is 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.220
 a series of surrealistic animation of 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.980
 psychological terror made in flash created 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.070
 by David Cirt in the year 2004 and it was made 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.050
 popular on the internet in the year 2005 goes 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.910
 of the day to day of an unusual type with 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.489
 disturbing aspect which has some 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.710
 quite rare tastes like caressing 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.559
 rusty objects on all spoons 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.199
 rusted and their friends are nothing but their 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.510
 long, hairy fingers he put to each 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.100
 one of his fingers a name to me 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.900
 it seems that this one has had many 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.390
 psychological problems which makes it 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.799
 one of the darkest caricatures and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.799
 mysterious that I have seen 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 number 2 play with me play with me is a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.580
 short film made by bs tries to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 a very peculiar story about a child 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
 corrupted and trapped by his mother in his 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.149
 room just for the fact of being 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.280
 protected the child comes out to play with 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.960
 a girl hiding from her mother and she 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.299
 find something that leaves him 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.039
 unconscious and wakes him up in his room 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
 again but this time they have mutilated him 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.780
 arms and legs his mother opens 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 the door and leaves the girl who saw in a 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.759
 corner of his room this short film 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.920
 has a kind of moral what gives 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 that disturbing touch is the music of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.789
 background and the development of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.590
 I'll leave the link of the video in 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.590
 the description so you can see it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.020
 number 3 hour of adventure I do not say that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.719
 it's a bad series but if you watch your 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 chapters will see that at certain times 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.939
 dark characters appear and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310
 dreary it could be said that they are something like 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.619
 like animated demons that leave a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.650
 feeling of ignorance and fear of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.510
 see them and many of the scenarios have 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.690
 certain aspect of horror movie 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.489
 but childish caricature version hour 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.500
 adventure represents the life of two 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.290
 friends who go through many situations 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.290
 in which they give off that feeling of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.629
 the unknown and unusual do not seem to me 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.480
 that these demon-possessed dolls are 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.940
 Suitable for children and has an appearance 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 of subliminal message that through the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.700
 joy of his characters hide something 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.700
 disturbing 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.490
 number 4 suicide mouse I know is a pancake 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.870
 and no pasta but it counts as a caricature 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.240
 suicide mouse is an animation that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.090
 represents the pancake and pasta mickey mouse 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.370
 which claims to be a forbidden chapter or 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.830
 missed walt disney but it does not 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.200
 it's still necessary to explain how disturbing 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.180
 be this video I will leave you in the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.070
 description the link of the video and the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.600
 creepy pasta can easily 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.600
 get on youtube 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.390
 number 5 of pit farmer this caricature 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 does not go much into the concept of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.310
 terrifying but still contains 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.070
 disturbing determination created by 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.190
 nick cross of pi farmer is an animation 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.260
 chronic representing the story of a 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.990
 pig farmer who at the end of his life ended 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.180
 in a disruptive misfortune the 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.580
 story is that the pig begins its day 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.070
 happy and doing typical things 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.080
 farmer until he comes to the part of 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.360
 enter and check the chicken coop the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.160
 which was totally absent from 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.800
 chickens and wrapped in a stage 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.630
 bloody of showing the pig 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.540
 farmer that the foxes had been 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.840
 there the farmer frustrated by the theft of 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.640
 his chickens go out fox hunting 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.580
 when you find the foxes these are 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.440
 in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.630
 appeasing the farmer's wrath the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.610
 foxes had set him a trap in 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.890
 which the farmer pig out does not 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.530
 intentionally drugged by the smoke of 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.990
 marijuana in the environment already by the fact 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.270
 that the farmer pig was in 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.699
 a state of hallucination when 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.009
 work the knowledge this is responsible 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.710
 of a massacre that he had caused in 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.930
 state of drug tion because in the end it was 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.389
 summoned to court to receive a trial 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.030
 where the assistance had the foxes 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.159
 and the pig ends up being accused as 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.229
 guilty how disturbing this 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.470
 animation is its graphic representation 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.580
 which is very explicit and unusual 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.580
 not suitable for children 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.540
 well this is so far what I have 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.830
 I could see if I can do 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.110
