00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.310
 and decided to upgrade the old 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.679
 soviet conditioner as 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.929
 thermostat ordered just such a fee from 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.980
 China according to the manufacturer this 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.079
 the device can work like 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.360
 heating devices so in 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.519
 chilling has sensitivity in 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.840
 one tenth of a degree and the possibility 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.050
 temperature sensor calibration 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.789
 maximum load current 10 amperes also 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.449
 There are delay hysteresis settings 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.609
 inclusions 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.589
 over temperature indication and 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.110
 upper and lower limit restrictions 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.210
 temperature settings to ensure 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.920
 correct operation of the device at the first 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 switching on it is necessary to reset 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.020
 settings on the factory for this 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 we press the buttons plus and minus 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.780
 at the same time supplying 12 volts to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 confirmation of reset to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.109
 the indicator will display three eights a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.410
 in a few seconds 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.550
 the current sensor temperature is displayed 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.280
 Now we are going to configure the device 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.440
 to fit your needs to enter the menu 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.480
 need to press the set button and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.309
 hold it for five seconds with 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
 using the plus and minus buttons 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.270
 you can move between settings and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.140
 change the value and so point pe 0 choice 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.320
 operating mode 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.040
 sea ​​for cooling devices oven for 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.170
 heating devices 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.000
 p1 hysteresis setting then the value 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.650
 temperature difference from the set 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.619
 values ​​at which the system 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 will change its state for example if i 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.970
 set the temperature of the air conditioner 25 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.430
 degrees and hysteresis set equal 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.740
 one degree then the air conditioner will 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 turn on at 25 degrees and turn off 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 at 24 degrees ne-2 we set the maximum 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 Petri temperature adjustment scale 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.250
 minimum p4 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 if necessary, you can hold 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.270
 temperature sensor calibration for this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.969
 mix ice water 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.000
 the substance thus obtained has 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.009
 temperature 0 degrees Celsius plunging 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.490
 temperature sensor in the water and wait a few 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.490
 minutes 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.659
 and so we see that the temperature is on 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.159
 indicator stopped on value plus 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:31.510
 0 4 degrees let's go through the menu item 4 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:33.670
 enter a value of minus 0.4 hold 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.370
 set button 3 seconds to save 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.909
 changes and exit the menu and on 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.400
 the indicator is exactly zero degrees in point 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.109
 5 you can adjust the delay before 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.299
 switching on load in minutes 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.060
 This item is especially relevant for 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.349
 compressor cooling systems so 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.810
 how the compressor may not start 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.760
 immediately after shutdown and fail 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.409
 and for correct start it is necessary 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 wait a few minutes for 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.780
 pressure balancing in circuits 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.629
 systems 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 point p6 you can set the value 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.239
 temperature when reached on 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.370
 indicator 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.219
 2 minuses will be displayed that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.049
 signals exceeding after 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.069
 how we set up the device can it 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.949
 check in action 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.239
 we press the set button we expose 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:23.680
 required temperature 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:27.099
 example will give and degrees Celsius heat 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.560
 sensor at 25 degrees relay operates 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.810
 LED does not light up indicating 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.849
 that load is included since we 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.939
 set the hysteresis value to 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.239
 one degree of fuel cooling 24 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.009
 degrees load off on this 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.870
 all who were interested put huskies 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.870
