00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Romanian Subbed by me! 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Before the show begins 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.000
 the meeting place was filled with fans from all over Asia. 

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.999
 They came to meet them 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I really like Junsu! 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.000
 Yoochun fighting! 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.000
 Oh. I like everyone. What should I do? 

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.000
 Eventually the show started with the voices of the fans 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 JYJ made their entry really great. 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.000
 Jaejoong, 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.000
 Junsu, 

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.000
 and Yoochun. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.999
 Showing different parts of them, displaying a cool picture. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 The first time on stage, they gave the fans a strong performance on the song Empty. 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
 Attracting the crowd with their powerful performance. 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.000
 Good ~! 

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:36.000
 Actually, today I got the album "The Beginning" around 17.30. 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
 Can you describe the album in a word? 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.000
 The best! 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:55.000
 The album "The Beginning" was made with world-renowned producers such as Kanye West and Rodney Jerkins, who are participating in the production. 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:02.000
 They sing the songs in English; worthy of being an album like the ones sold around the world. 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.000
 While you worked in America, what was different? 

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:15.000
 I did not use the customs duties there. 

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.000
 Because I have been doing business in Japan for a very long time ... 

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.999
 Oh Jaejoong ... are you confident in Japan? 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 No .. it's not about self-confidence, but .. 

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:28.000
 Since there are a lot of fans coming from Japan today. Please, say something in Japanese. 

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.000
 Thank you all! [Minna arigatou!] 

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.000
 In Korean ... 

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.000
 Thank you all! 

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.000
 Everybody thank you !! [Cuteee] 

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:02.000
 Yoochun playing Lee Seon Jun in the SungKyunK Scandal drama has made fans' hearts beat fast. 

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:10.000
 Yoochun has to swing a show schedule. It has to be tedious. 

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:16.000
 He gave fans a great show. Yoochun is incredible! &lt;3 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 I wanted to hold the microphone and sit on the stage. 

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:24.000
 I really like the fact that I've been busy these days. 

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:28.000
 It was very hard for me .. not having anything to do .. 

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.000
 Jaejoong, do you not appear in a drama? 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.799
 Compared to him, I had nothing to do ... 

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.000
 This is not because you have nothing to do. Is it because you did not have time to do something? 

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:40.000
 I wanted to go on stage quickly. I just want to be on stage ... 

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:48.000
 I wanted to get a lot of love, I wanted to work hard to get love. 

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:52.000
 During this world album, my resolution seems to have started. Please give us a lot of love. 

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:02.000
 Now we will sing "Found You" in the SKK Scandal drama. 

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.000
 Song from OST from SKK Scandal where the star is Yoochun member. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 I'm very happy to be able to breathe with everyone again. 

00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:39.001
 Thank you sincerely. 

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.002
 The 3 members will go to 6 countries (9 cities) to meet their fans around the world. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 It was the best performance! : D 

00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:55.001
 oh ... because it's been a while since they had been doing business in Korea, I was warmed up and rejoiced in myself. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.002
 JYJ will continue to show their cool image in Korea.
