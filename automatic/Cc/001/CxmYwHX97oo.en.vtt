00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 show new video of me today how to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:19.109
 a vice ps my rack server touches down 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.520
 because it's this video especially for craft 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 and played because I just 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.119
 and then I get exactly 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.650
 and thus a bush line I have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 that all done you have to me there 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 also have an accompaniment as it comes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 has defined it, I have it all 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.440
 down right now you have to feed like that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.579
 going 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 and there my escort pulls 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.800
 continue and then into the gate server and that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 Select minecraft and then because 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.489
 as I said my idea that gets 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.710
 he so a file you have to then 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.820
 unpack or and then I packed 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.640
 easy and then escape somewhere 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 this is just my vice beast you have 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.340
 already done on minecraft 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.750
 switch 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 yes you have mine too 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 change body and therefore now 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 I do not even extra that now 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880
 Just take it with me 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.610
 Stop that a bit 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.259
 that probably lasts with everyone 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.509
 so there I am again now has that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.090
 slammed and the commission as 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.210
 background picture so that's how you get that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.700
 server set up now says the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.460
 file goes down then I have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 unpacked so thanks there only then starts 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.790
 you take these servers instead and beate 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.050
 but you can do that before you start 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.800
 change that by default here now 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.810
 on 512 that is the four megabyte ram 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.320
 really turns 1024 so actually 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.880
 work rambert used exactly then stop 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 Increase in perpetrators takes between 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.820
 row a little bit 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.370
 that's all you already are 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.620
 make with the server file the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.990
 server properties I think will be concrete 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.620
 the house makes it behind and he knows it 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.030
 already determined by the x server 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.440
 then you download channel down that is 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 the program here 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 if we want to play together accurate 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.600
 beautiful side alsmann mustang 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.860
 Download interpret then down 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.440
 is installed there is also offered 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.780
 that one desktop widget needs and thus can 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.430
 All this can easily be deselected 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.239
 because you see that holder you have to 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.730
 the brand on the tara website on the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.709
 screen then you can either one 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.160
 own network quickly what i tell you 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:05.840
 would also recommend would recommend 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.360
 because right network will stop you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.450
 other server another but in one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.780
 other player friend or not 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.459
 it seems when he goes out and she stops 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.400
 theoretically though and even 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.170
 that's why economics are missing 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.230
 network to make your own and right there 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.390
 I do that is the area and you 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.640
 now actually gc out of business 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.620
 you both have to network if he wants you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:42.260
 have logged 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.260
 at the same time, not everything is possible 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.150
 minecraft de and yes then please 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.350
 then change as web 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.260
 is complete and so now are yes 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.570
 a few people in it you can see her 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.180
 Law 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:10.350
 and then you chose user name 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.900
 has been logged in and the culprit 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.470
 daniel is and if there is a cross before it 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.600
 I'm not scared because then 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.160
 no connection 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.270
 if he is not a cross but here 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.530
 just a connection there is everything 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.750
 okay but I assume ours 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.110
 Connection is where I did not play 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.060
 have 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.120
 cruiser before where I should play and 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.840
 if you can do it then 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.540
 refueling 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.370
 then you can go here for the summer 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:57.240
 start 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:59.730
 the stop of the file then at the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.070
 mother server runs on it 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.070
 computer that can easily be localhost 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:20.870
 hearty and buttersÃ¤ure not on 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.520
 computer is running there your day and the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.720
 I assume that the 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.440
 congress but that will run on the pc 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.140
 but it contrasts the ip of 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.450
 you and then you have under unplayed 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.410
 later with others 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:43.290
 so enter 75 50 30 it at the 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.380
 secular bed and is with you 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:52.880
 probably it's like that too 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:56.070
 and then you have to stop 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.410
 and I will make a pass as it says 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.380
 to music 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.770
 laughed and how to see who massive 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.770
 blocked 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.790
 that was my video and a lot of fun 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.860
 try it and I just hope 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.860
 that I can provide this offer 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.160
 sit up server and that soon 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:32.690
 you're ready to start playing again 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:32.690
 could yes to six times and bye
