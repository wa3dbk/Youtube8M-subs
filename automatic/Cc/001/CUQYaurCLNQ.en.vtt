00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hi friends, it gives me pleasure again 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.290
 greet them in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.290
 present 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.210
 a circuit that is a clock in time 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.439
 real 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.140
 good this circuit was elaborated 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.730
 with the integrated one help from 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.130
 integrated s 1307 which is a clock in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.899
 real time 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.669
 that is basically helped by a stack 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.730
 that keeps it activated when not 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.130
 there is current at the peak that is the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.160
 that displays the data in this case in 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.309
 a good lcd the circuit that we observe 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 here is the copy of lcd has a 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.690
 potentiometer can regulate let's say that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.289
 the intensity of the characters in the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.570
 screen we have these cables that are 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.210
 those of communication of the pique with a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.489
 lcd 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.780
 in this case we are using in this 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.110
 case rather use peak 16 f 8 87 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.990
 with a quartz crystal of 4 megahertz 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.220
 we observe here the capacitors that 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.740
 use 22 peak for god to be able to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.130
 these are part of the support will swing to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.130
 crystal 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.830
 well the clock is very accurate the truth 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.020
 since it has a quartz crystal 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.960
 where the clocks let's say more 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.320
 more accurate because of the crystal we have 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.290
 here a switch to configure 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 The time on the clock 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.580
 the communication protocol that uses 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.530
 this integrated is 12 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.530
 we have two communication cables 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.820
 let's say that basically a 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.970
 communication 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.430
 between the peak between the peak and this 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.620
 integrated to send the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.420
 information from the peak to the integrated 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.100
 of or in this case when we are 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 visualizing in the now we are seeing 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.580
 directly attract the data you have 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 the integrated to be able to visualize them in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.220
 the lcd are processed at the peak and then 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.970
 we send them to the lcd obviously 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.860
 us when making a data entry 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.330
 a is integrated have to be passed or 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.790
 process at the peak and then send them 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.230
 we use three buttons one is for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.120
 activate configuration mode and 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 visualization of now let's say that at 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.440
 moment to pass it here we activate the mode 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 of setting the time we have in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.600
 the button to change what 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.070
 we want to change, let's say 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.280
 values that we want to change if they are 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.580
 hours minutes hour the day the year 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 one of your to upload the data and another 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 to lower them good basically this is 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 programming was done in micro it 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.300
 obviously in the language c 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.049
 because nothing of the clock then counts of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.049
 year 2000 the 2000 99 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.440
 and let's say that watch is very accurate 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.010
 identifies to some extent 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.740
 at the time of the days the years change 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.540
 automatically 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.740
 you have to be careful if at the moment of 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 enter the values because if we 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.880
 entering him we enter a 90 days 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.710
 obviously it appears on 90 and there yes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.750
 the clock will be unconfigured because I know that 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.070
 only take care internally 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.570
 when the clock is working 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.140
 there is no problem because 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.110
 example we were 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.870
 in hours it reaches 23 then it restarts 0 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.400
 hours work in 24 hour mode 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.700
 or 12 hours depending on the configuration 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.709
 in this case we have configured in 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.299
 24 hours I will not turn on this 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.950
 moment clock is already set and is 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.109
 working at this time of the eye 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.680
 because it has the battery I'm going to 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.480
 turn on 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.530
 my power source 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.180
 and let's see how it works 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.599
 we hope here we have 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.209
 13 hours 27 minutes at this time 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.000
 started with 2 seconds at this time 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.930
 Friday is the data that pulls me here 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.930
 but it's 30/11 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.930
 2013 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.289
 is the configuration that you have in this 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.639
 obviously we can change it from 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.060
 this configuration was the last one that 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.190
 We put a time of testing I 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.289
 to change at this moment I'm going to activate 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.180
 here this button to perform this 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.360
 switch to be able to enter the mode of 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.440
 configuration if we observe here I would 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.910
 I'm going to give a little more intensity 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 so that it causes us to do well because 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.270
 we are making a deadline 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.110
 if we observe 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.110
 we have 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.319
 let's go to intensity 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.569
 unless it exists if we reach 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.870
 observed we have hours that we have to 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.090
 13 hours now 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.470
 and then I'm going to press the button 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.860
 black that was the one that told him 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.290
 modality let's see how it changes hours 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.830
 now we have minutes that are 28 minutes 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.880
 we have 28 seconds on day 6 which is 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.290
 Friday 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.810
 I am going to change the day at this moment 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.449
 on day 1 on sunday tuesday wednesday 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.699
 let's leave Wednesday 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.630
 I'm going to change let's see what gives you two 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.720
 data the date 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.580
 today we are going to put him first 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.580
 we will set a date 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.330
 let's put it first November 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:40.110
 until November of the year 2012 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.830
 until 2013 we are going to put it in 2000 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.610
 12 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.740
 very well 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.129
 it's already 13 o'clock, I'm going to put 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.129
 eleven 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.910
 good because I'm going up I'm going down 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.910
 they are safe 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.590
 29 minutes is fine seconds is fine 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.880
 I'm going to come back here with the little button 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.270
 to be able to visualize what we have changed 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.770
 I put it on Tuesday and I 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.600
 I stay on Tuesday we will observe 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:14.500
 here I will return to see what day 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.270
 configure let's see Sunday is 1 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.670
 let's make that record to be able 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.560
 observe 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.860
 There is Sunday 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.000
 Monday Tuesday Wednesday to balance the 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.780
 Wednesday of 4 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.110
 Wednesday , November 1st, 2012 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:37.280
 we are 11 with 29 with 38 if 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:40.390
 we observe at this moment we have 45 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:47.280
 seconds I turn off my source 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:52.180
 and at this time I could go on 50 51 52 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.590
 53 54 55 out there is pretty much I'm going to 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.740
 turn on and for you to see that the 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.120
 clock is still working there we have already 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.240
 came to 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.840
 we were already the nvidia that are going 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.590
 if we count the second and good this is 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.320
 the operation of our watch 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.970
 and good for here I'm going to leave them at the foot 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.650
 of the video the code that we have used 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.670
 so that you can use it in 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.090
 your projects 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.790
 I have uploaded this code and this video 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.560
 because on the internet there is very very 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.580
 little material for door balconies to 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.980
 we the truth has cost us 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.620
 enough work can make one 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.990
 rather, it has taken us 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.620
 Research time I hope you serve them 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:38.560
 analyze the code and well there 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.390
 to say hello to the most beautiful field 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.390
 dry because here always to order
