00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.450
 Tomorrow wanted to be here I declare today 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.910
 in a garden guide the meaningful 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.009
 use of grenades first three 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.650
 various whitening techniques of garnets 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.240
 Once the sharks are allowed to be easy 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.669
 high jumps and it hits completely 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.740
 high on explodes right on the floor 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.390
 popped no chance to respond because 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.550
 the grenade exactly and there comes opponent 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.370
 is and he can not avoid it anymore 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.840
 Then there are the bounces off the grenade 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.030
 it just comes to where it otherwise 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 can not reach with your fÃ¼ssen against 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.470
 wales side of the wall will be standing now 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 threatens and simply normal 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:52.370
 Grenades here in our rooms on 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.449
 true ground and goes in overdue I 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.979
 have a battlefield until relatively late 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.659
 Note that grenades are really useful 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.979
 can be with the right one 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.750
 basic knowledge and the right one 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.710
 Wound engineering you can with true miracles 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.449
 accomplish 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.180
 so here are my tips and tricks 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.220
 video for grenades once I show 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 the little mobile little wall 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.250
 hackers are 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.140
 I do not really know if your opponent 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.240
 is simply a grenade pure 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 and I listen because now again 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 play with increased sound so that you 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.780
 now also good on youtube video 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.040
 here I have the opponent clear 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.390
 and clearly heard and I could even 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.190
 exactly through the wall hung like she was in 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.570
 have enemies heard if you 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.330
 powerful headset and the right one 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.830
 higher structure works the net was 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.510
 not to kill because just prefer 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.160
 because I hear or is an opponent 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.810
 the hit like simple but nice 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.450
 by-products opponent ever wounded 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 The next tip with the garden park too 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.890
 do and I believe that some of you 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.900
 The 120 usually has four 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.730
 committees magazine now grenades burger 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.620
 you have bombarded them 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.229
 It is just a grenade grenade 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.240
 perfect here both more normal who on 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.360
 grenades one more than three 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.800
 more grenades for grenade launcher more 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.659
 so after the blunt theory now the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.090
 practice here are some practical examples 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.430
 I with my victim jonas 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.580
 I have taken this is for 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.690
 example, an application of the high end 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.069
 So far, that's exactly what they are 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.299
 then when she comes to the ground 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.440
 explodes and the opponents behind the 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.190
 cover firmly true abyssal is in 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.400
 In this case, I use one 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.590
 Contractor his bounced 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.810
 I know his in it is safe in the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.090
 testify if the opponent runs out of 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.819
 panic that is the opponent piece with 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.140
 personal energies or me, of course 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.310
 you can just suspect your network in 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.079
 throw a room and then for example 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.579
 no matter if you fight back, but in 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.750
 this case, since the debate out 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.989
 I know that he is an enemy 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.730
 One hundred percent is in there but I have 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.170
 the secure data kill another one 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.299
 week I sent out very often apply 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.989
 is just the security council before the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.790
 reloaded 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.170
 Assuming you meet your opponent 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.540
 just not and you know why 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.099
 It just does not hit me if I do 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.760
 just before reloading grenade 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.720
 throw down, then load and wait 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.099
 after that load that means she makes sure 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.079
 that the opponent is either tacked on 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.639
 dies or is pressed and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.700
 Meanwhile, you can only load what 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.889
 a next example for the sharks or 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.709
 also longbow grenade is the archway 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.689
 tastes here is now magna is very 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.859
 difficult kind therefore really behind 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.780
 to get the stone 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.819
 but if I'm supposed to get one 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.319
 your safe kill and me today 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.000
 on the other hand, it would usually just be dead 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.949
 it is important that they are over 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.599
 the archway out of the cover the 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.690
 Grenade throws the expected of the opponent 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.010
 Usually I should not give him enough 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.690
 Exercise with the grenades have that 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.160
 you can have the right way out 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.379
 also such professional height 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.750
 try this is a perfect one 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.099
 timed harakiri simply the opponent 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.599
 behind the cover brings and perfect 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.209
 explodes without the opponent badge 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.159
 you can also do two-week 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.260
 connect with each other here, for example 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.459
 again a slightly bounced aid too 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.979
 thrown up slightly that one 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.349
 I blew up a little earlier here 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:59.769
 a short explanation by jonas ak 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.919
 physically, and he means 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.260
 to garnets that you use the environment 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.810
 should and almost minigolf with grenades 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.340
 play is a mini golf has played in 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.250
 Do you know what I mean by that or 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.669
 version as meaning meaningful 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.930
 use of the map in order is the 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.630
 Grenades flight clock was just easy 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.909
 a parable and the must of rolf 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.639
 angle and bounce angle the advancement 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.009
 order 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.169
 It sounds like it's complicated to compute 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.270
 not always that could be intuitive inside 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.689
 lost and then at which 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.020
 a lot more fun to clips from the 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.710
 now out of 200 scott gration dsl 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.349
 taken simply 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.260
 january and against played and 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:52.870
 meanwhile , these are patients 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.870
 I have him 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:33.729
 I do not go banana 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.729
 on the house 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.770
 that's just practical examples 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.730
 now really on walls in 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.620
 right play 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.850
 I would advise you that too 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.680
 expression who takes you just that 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.270
 grenade park times in the squad with you 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.730
 if no other what also at the spot and 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.780
 exercise to try it yourself eject 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.120
 make the master of that now 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.070
 true just because really have fun while 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.810
 spam until the next video and me 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.210
 I hope I could help you as always 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.630
 comments below the video and thanks 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.630
 for watching 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.500
 thought sweet but this is 0 percent 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.500
 real
