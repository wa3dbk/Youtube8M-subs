done okay guys so here is the finished
product<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.480> wish<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.660> would<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:09.020> chopped<00:03:09.319> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
product I wish I would have chopped the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.410 
product I wish I would have chopped the
sweet<00:03:09.680> potatoes<00:03:10.069> down<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> little<00:03:10.880> bit<00:03:11.000> smaller

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
sweet potatoes down a little bit smaller

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.690 
sweet potatoes down a little bit smaller
I<00:03:11.920> kind<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:12.950> thought<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.130> they<00:03:13.370> would<00:03:13.520> break

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
I kind of thought that they would break

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.410 
I kind of thought that they would break
down<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:14.360> they<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.720> didn't<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.300> was

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
down but they really didn't and I was

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.240 
down but they really didn't and I was
hoping<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.810> would<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.989> thicker<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:19.040> that's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
hoping it would be thicker but that's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.550 
hoping it would be thicker but that's
okay

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
okay

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.430 
okay
so<00:03:21.560> yeah<00:03:21.920> tastes<00:03:22.910> pretty<00:03:23.180> good<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:26.440> can

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209

portioned<00:03:41.989> out<00:03:42.140> into<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.830> muffin<00:03:43.250> tin<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
portioned out into a muffin tin it's a

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.910 
portioned out into a muffin tin it's a
little<00:03:45.230> bit<00:03:45.350> under<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.800> half<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.220> cup<00:03:46.370> portion<00:03:47.920> so

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
little bit under a half a cup portion so

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.949 
little bit under a half a cup portion so
I'd<00:03:49.310> probably<00:03:49.489> see<00:03:49.760> maybe<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.060> third<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.810> cup

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
I'd probably see maybe a third of a cup

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:51.610 
I'd probably see maybe a third of a cup
or<00:03:51.140> so

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
or so

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.000 
or so
and<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:53.239> once<00:03:53.570> those<00:03:53.840> are<00:03:53.870> frozen<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.769> will

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and so once those are frozen then I will

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.970 
and so once those are frozen then I will
pop<00:03:55.400> them<00:03:55.579> into<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:56.269> bag<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.140> cover<00:03:57.709> them<00:03:57.890> in

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
pop them into a bag and cover them in

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.250 
pop them into a bag and cover them in
foil<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.310> prevent<00:03:58.640> freezer<00:03:59.180> burn<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.720> they're

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
foil to prevent freezer burn and they're

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.130
