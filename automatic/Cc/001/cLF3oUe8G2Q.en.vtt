00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I pub stomping is something that I did a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.999 
I pub stomping is something that I did a
lot<00:00:12.450> more<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.750> backups<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.650> always<00:00:13.860> like

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
lot more in backups to I was always like

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.129 
lot more in backups to I was always like
playing<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.519> trying<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.420> those<00:00:15.599> highest

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
playing it trying to get those highest

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.810 
playing it trying to get those highest
scores<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.580> enjoyed<00:00:17.789> doing

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
scores and I really really enjoyed doing

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.099 
scores and I really really enjoyed doing
that<00:00:18.060> black<00:00:18.270> ops<00:00:18.420> 2<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.630> finally<00:00:18.869> managed<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that black ops 2 and finally managed to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.480 
that black ops 2 and finally managed to
get<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.770> pinnacle<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.369> me

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
get like the kind of pinnacle for me

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.300 
get like the kind of pinnacle for me
which<00:00:20.699> was<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> 300-plus<00:00:21.600> gameplay

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
which was like the 300-plus gameplay

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.019 
which was like the 300-plus gameplay
towards<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.369> end<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.970> was

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
towards the end of it I think it was

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.580 
towards the end of it I think it was
like<00:00:24.150> June<00:00:24.420> last<00:00:24.660> year<00:00:24.810> which<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> currently<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
like June last year which is currently a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460 
like June last year which is currently a
