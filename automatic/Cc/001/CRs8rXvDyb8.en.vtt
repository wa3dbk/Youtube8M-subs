00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.650
 on civil online skills 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.829
 the main ones are seven resistance mi 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:36.809
 stealth guide table guide was 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:39.430
 mental I don't touch the first is the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.260
 Hunt also rode my mom I 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.790
 you will have to go to the precise point of the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.770
 map as you surely already have 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.210
 seen the previous video 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.870
 you will have to go to this point where 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.090
 you will climb the wall you will have to approach it 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 at the wall click square take a 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.360
 rifle and aim somewhere e 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.110
 follow on a wall click watched 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.840
 you will go mag 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:10.299
 activate the police and get 3 you will have to 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 do more and 18 and killings possible for 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.060
 increase but not a second is the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.950
 resistance 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 you will have to do the American bg race that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.850
 it is good to bind the hosting business 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.690
 activity races created by rockstar three 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.710
 American races and dg 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.780
 this activity is recommended that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.909
 they do resistance many times 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.610
 main and no the principle to fuck e 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.290
 it serves more than all the others the aim and the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 resistance are at the same pace you put 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.759
 abkhazi various things in the settings 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 put so right to make you understand the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.799
 video for video in proceedings 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.799
 settings confirmations 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.680
 I advise you to put the presence 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.140
 collisions likely if you do two though 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.410
 I believe you will do it yourself is a bit 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.410
 better 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.320
 The inspection councils are the enduro 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 the endurona recycle and the whippet I have 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 took the tricycle himself because aesthetics a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.060
 I like it better ok, started cut 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.080
 the race because I crashed 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.040
 absurd and because of this bike that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.990
 he is not dead ie these bikes are not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:52.050
 very maneuverable you can tell them 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.910
 left i finished it all i put you 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.210
 minute you should letter me 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.390
 definitely cut it more than half 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.210
 oh well it arrived at the finish line and so on 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.050
 I would have existed it has not diminished 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.740
 I already have the maximum, the second is the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.550
 guide 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.420
 the guide is done by going to the mission 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:22.350
 previous criminal convictions that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.220
 unlocks at rank one seems to me against 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.430
 to the rank of this mission of mission 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.540
 is the shortest and gt gtl interest tender 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.239
 to the goal of 35 a type a round between one 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.200
 thirty seconds the net plays every 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.709
 13 turns turns but what the fuck I say every 13 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.660
 laps of this race will be others 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.140
 statistics will increase by 20 percent 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.140
 of the guide has already turned around you know 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.140
 let's begin 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 ok we start going to start 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.650
 put in the car 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 the machine makes no difference is the same 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.930
 I could even go with a panda that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.890
 there is no criminal record game 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.049
 that I already finished one from above 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.329
 thirty seconds 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.049
 you should do it here I did a nice day 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.049
 if I remember correctly 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.540
 expect a thirty asked 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.330
 second 7 Jan 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.070
 well these will be the second on 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.250
 force you have to take a car 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.960
 any you should get help from a 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.139
 your friend put it in the car 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.690
 and you should kick and punch in 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.060
 this machine until you there 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.570
 annoyed of course because a little 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.280
 boring and a good new york this 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.530
 however this trick this sort of 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.630
 grays can be said to increase more 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.940
 easily the force will only work with 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.690
 the friend in the car and if not dicks 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.740
 your 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.900
 and what makes the second is flight 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.690
 you should take an eros in the track 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.010
 which you prefer to do up and down up to 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.950
 when it does not increase the skill itself on 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.570
 and down until I'm okay 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:27.889
 repeating the second time that second 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:36.979
 I suffer from alzheimer I should cut 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:39.200
 laundered the second and stealth 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.300
 you'll have to go to a garage because more 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.870
 quiet press for three and turn 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:49.250
 this species these indoors 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.220
 makeup can be said is very long long 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.590
 to increase it to maximum range 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.099
 ball breaker found a method with cartons 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.620
 tags to get ready to have 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.060
 summit but tria cheats nor suggest you is 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.129
 normal that you should let go down for 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.229
 finished the oxygen and come back up 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.279
 I checked from all rubber parts 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:20.239
 controlled by all parties and I have not 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:24.459
 found nothing out of nothing about itself 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:24.459
 for today it's all nice guys
