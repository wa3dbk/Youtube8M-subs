00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
personally have not even cared about the

personally have not even cared about the
iOS<00:01:02.820> YouTube<00:01:03.300> app<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.719> never<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.350> used<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
iOS YouTube app I never really used it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.359 
iOS YouTube app I never really used it
because<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> mobile<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.369> far

because I actually use a mobile one far
much<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.299> than<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> actual<00:01:11.850> stock

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

much more than just the actual stock
YouTube<00:01:12.630> app<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.939> nicer<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and all that good stuff so YouTube app

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.570 
and all that good stuff so YouTube app
on<00:01:23.119> iOS<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> honestly

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
on iOS it kind of actually it honestly

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.230 
on iOS it kind of actually it honestly
it<00:01:27.030> sucks<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.630> opinion<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.909> many<00:01:29.909> have

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it sucks in my opinion and many have

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
it sucks in my opinion and many have
been<00:01:30.390> saying<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> Google<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.560> making<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
been saying that Google will be making a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
been saying that Google will be making a
youtube<00:01:32.549> app<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.119> iOS<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> future<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
youtube app for iOS in the future and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
youtube app for iOS in the future and
that<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.729> able<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.390> be

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that will be actually able to be

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.590 
that will be actually able to be
downloaded<00:01:37.320> straight<00:01:38.040> from<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> app<00:01:38.430> store

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
downloaded straight from the app store

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
downloaded straight from the app store
so<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> route<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.189> mean

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so if they do go that route I mean

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
so if they do go that route I mean
Google<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.119> mean<00:01:42.270> they're<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.229> Apple

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
Google I mean they're not with Apple

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
Google I mean they're not with Apple
anymore<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.240> whatever<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.689> want

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
anymore so I can do whatever they want

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
anymore so I can do whatever they want
with<00:01:46.049> their<00:01:46.649> YouTube<00:01:47.100> app<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:47.670> release

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
with their YouTube app and then release

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.710 
with their YouTube app and then release
it<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.750> iOS<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.520> guess<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.180> would<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> lot

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it on iOS so I guess that would be a lot

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.520 
it on iOS so I guess that would be a lot
better<00:01:52.020> because<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> youtube<00:01:54.659> stock<00:01:55.290> app

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
better because the youtube stock app

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.520 
better because the youtube stock app
that<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.689> iOS<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.649> plain-out<00:01:59.250> sucked

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
that was on iOS it just plain-out sucked

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
that was on iOS it just plain-out sucked
now<00:02:01.530> what<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> guys<00:02:02.939> is
