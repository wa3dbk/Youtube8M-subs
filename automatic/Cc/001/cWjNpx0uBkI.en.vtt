puppy hammer I'll show you in a minute
first<00:00:35.450> let's<00:00:35.570> talk<00:00:35.690> about<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.960> anatomy<00:00:36.290> of

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
first let's talk about the anatomy of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.890 
first let's talk about the anatomy of
the<00:00:37.040> basic<00:00:37.700> puppy<00:00:38.000> hammer<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:38.540> essentially

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
the basic puppy hammer it's essentially

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.960 
the basic puppy hammer it's essentially
a<00:00:39.260> really<00:00:39.800> long<00:00:40.040> meteor<00:00:40.400> it's<00:00:40.580> about<00:00:40.730> nine

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
a really long meteor it's about nine

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.870 
a really long meteor it's about nine
feet<00:00:41.000> long<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:43.040> only<00:00:43.250> thing<00:00:43.400> that<00:00:43.550> really

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
feet long and the only thing that really

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.880 
feet long and the only thing that really
sort<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.510> sets<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.840> apart<00:00:44.930> from<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.410> standard

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
sort of sets it apart from a standard

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.940 
sort of sets it apart from a standard
meteor<00:00:46.220> is<00:00:46.490> its<00:00:47.030> length<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.620> that<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.770> has

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
meteor is its length and that it has

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.510 
meteor is its length and that it has
these<00:00:49.430> knots<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.950> then<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.160> course<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
these knots in it and then of course the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.700 
these knots in it and then of course the
way<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:53.030> wear<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.480> sort<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.290> puppy<00:00:54.560> hammer

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
way you wear it sort of the puppy hammer

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.950 
way you wear it sort of the puppy hammer
thing<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.820> can<00:00:56.150> see<00:00:56.300> I've<00:00:56.420> got<00:00:56.600> boy<00:00:57.290> and

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
thing so you can see I've got boy and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.020 
thing so you can see I've got boy and
and<00:00:59.960> then<00:01:00.590> these<00:01:00.770> knots<00:01:01.399> which<00:01:01.670> service

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
and then these knots which service

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.980 
and then these knots which service
handles<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:03.430> then<00:01:04.430> there's<00:01:05.239> two<00:01:05.479> knots<00:01:05.690> here

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
handles and then there's two knots here

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.240 
handles and then there's two knots here
which<00:01:06.320> hold<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.310> bandana<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
which hold this bandana on and the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.310 
which hold this bandana on and the
bandana<00:01:11.060> axe<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.510> sort<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:11.900> an<00:01:12.050> anti

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
bandana axe is sort of like an anti

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.590 
bandana axe is sort of like an anti
cheap<00:01:12.590> mechanism<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.820> knots<00:01:14.000> are<00:01:14.210> all<00:01:14.390> so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
cheap mechanism but the knots are all so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.940 
cheap mechanism but the knots are all so
that<00:01:15.170> there's<00:01:15.740> sort<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:17.470> component<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
that there's sort of a component of the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.770 
that there's sort of a component of the
crop<00:01:19.190> like<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.549> can<00:01:19.700> see<00:01:19.850> there<00:01:20.060> they're

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
crop like you can see there they're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.039 
crop like you can see there they're
about<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.200> same<00:01:21.549> length<00:01:22.549> as<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:23.360> POI<00:01:23.600> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
about the same length as a POI and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.200 
about the same length as a POI and
that's<00:01:24.409> because<00:01:24.830> these<00:01:25.400> two<00:01:25.460> knots<00:01:25.850> are<00:01:26.030> used

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
that's because these two knots are used

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.320 
that's because these two knots are used
for<00:01:26.450> escapes<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.140> captures<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.060> also<00:01:29.060> for

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
for escapes and captures and also for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.510 
for escapes and captures and also for
one-handed<00:01:29.990> meteor<00:01:30.500> kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.799> stuff<00:01:31.010> it's

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
one-handed meteor kind of stuff it's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.980 
one-handed meteor kind of stuff it's
sort<00:01:31.760> of<00:01:31.820> like<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> marker<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.840> know

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
sort of like a marker so that you know

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.080 
sort of like a marker so that you know
how<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> get<00:01:33.740> back<00:01:33.860> into<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:34.520> get<00:01:34.700> out<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.970> it

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
how to get back into it or get out of it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.060 
how to get back into it or get out of it
you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:36.140> kind<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.350> think<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.590> them<00:01:36.710> as<00:01:36.890> like

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
you can kind of think of them as like

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.160 
you can kind of think of them as like
the<00:01:37.430> dots<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> fret<00:01:38.420> board<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.780> guitar

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the dots on the fret board on a guitar

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.850 
the dots on the fret board on a guitar
that's<00:01:39.650> sort<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.010> same<00:01:40.220> deal<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.650> now<00:01:42.650> how

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that's sort of the same deal so now how

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.160 
that's sort of the same deal so now how
do<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.280> wear<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.820> puppy<00:01:44.060> hammer<00:01:44.270> there's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
do you wear the puppy hammer there's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.020 
do you wear the puppy hammer there's
lots<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.710> ways<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:45.979> do<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.580> I'm<00:01:46.640> sure<00:01:46.790> many

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
lots of ways to do it and I'm sure many

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.060 
lots of ways to do it and I'm sure many
of<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.299> will<00:01:47.420> come<00:01:47.570> up<00:01:47.689> with<00:01:47.810> lots<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.439> other

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
of you will come up with lots of other

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.230 
of you will come up with lots of other
ways<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.400> do<00:01:49.700> it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
ways to do it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.940 
ways to do it
the<00:01:50.540> main<00:01:50.720> one<00:01:50.960> though<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.350> put<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.560> on<00:01:51.830> your

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
neck like this and then

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.010 
neck like this and then

knuckles like that or whatever but I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.000 
knuckles like that or whatever but I
prefer<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.869> hold<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.410> between<00:02:11.560> my<00:02:11.739> thumb<00:02:11.890> and

prefer to hold it between my thumb and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.210 
prefer to hold it between my thumb and
forefinger<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:13.410> aside<00:02:14.410> from<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.680> the

forefinger like this aside from that the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.059 
forefinger like this aside from that the
the<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.450> important<00:02:16.989> thing<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
the really important thing if are the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.640 
the really important thing if are the
the<00:02:18.459> exact<00:02:18.849> dimensions<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.750> puppy<00:02:20.440> hammer

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
the exact dimensions of the puppy hammer

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.820 
the exact dimensions of the puppy hammer
they're<00:02:21.310> they're<00:02:21.610> sort<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> pretty<00:02:23.110> unique<00:02:23.440> to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
they're they're sort of pretty unique to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.620 
they're they're sort of pretty unique to
every<00:02:24.340> individual<00:02:24.970> spinner<00:02:25.360> you're<00:02:25.540> gonna

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
every individual spinner you're gonna

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.050 
every individual spinner you're gonna
have<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.900> sort<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.140> tail<00:02:26.380> or<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:27.760> puppy

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
have to sort of tail or make your puppy

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.350 
have to sort of tail or make your puppy
hammer<00:02:28.239> for<00:02:28.480> yourself<00:02:30.030> because<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
hammer for yourself because the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.420 
hammer for yourself because the
dimensions<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.110> specific<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.280> way

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
dimensions are so specific so the way

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.340 
dimensions are so specific so the way
the<00:02:33.790> way<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.910> work<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> dimensions<00:02:34.660> is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
the way you work out the dimensions is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.770 
the way you work out the dimensions is
you<00:02:35.709> put<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.880> puppy<00:02:37.150> hammer<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.569> this

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
you put on the puppy hammer like this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.530 
you put on the puppy hammer like this
and<00:02:38.250> when<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.280> out<00:02:39.519> stretch<00:02:39.880> your<00:02:40.060> arms<00:02:42.540> there

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and when you out stretch your arms there

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.449 
and when you out stretch your arms there
should<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:43.989> slight<00:02:44.560> tension<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.280> can

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
should be this slight tension so you can

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.520 
should be this slight tension so you can
sort<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.760> cinch<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.390> rope<00:02:46.630> with<00:02:46.989> your<00:02:47.110> fingers

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
sort of cinch the rope with your fingers

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.559 
sort of cinch the rope with your fingers
outward<00:02:47.769> until<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.730> feel<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.180> slight

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
outward until you feel this slight

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.050 
outward until you feel this slight
pressure<00:02:50.160> throughout<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.310> entire<00:02:51.640> length<00:02:51.910> of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
pressure throughout the entire length of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.610 
pressure throughout the entire length of
the<00:02:52.209> rope<00:02:52.360> across<00:02:52.540> your<00:02:52.930> arms<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.319> your<00:02:53.470> neck

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the rope across your arms and your neck

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.500 
the rope across your arms and your neck
and<00:02:53.799> your<00:02:53.890> shoulders<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:55.180> sort<00:02:55.450> of

and your shoulders and that sort of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.800 
and your shoulders and that sort of
indicates<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.030> right<00:02:58.030> length

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
indicates that you have the right length

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.539 
indicates that you have the right length
between<00:02:59.769> your<00:03:00.370> two<00:03:00.670> hands<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:02.140> there<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:03.220> you

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
between your two hands from there if you

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.789 
between your two hands from there if you
hold<00:03:04.329> again<00:03:05.019> between<00:03:05.230> your<00:03:05.500> thumb<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.680> your

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
hold again between your thumb and your

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.699 
hold again between your thumb and your
forefinger<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.510> raise<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.200> point<00:03:08.440> part

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
forefinger and you raise the point part

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.960 
forefinger and you raise the point part
up<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:10.090> should<00:03:10.420> hang<00:03:10.890> down<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.700> level

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
up it should hang down to just level

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.270 
up it should hang down to just level
with<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.329> elbow<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.930> that's<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:15.100> really

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
with your elbow and that's a really

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.770 
with your elbow and that's a really
important<00:03:15.730> part<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:17.220> when<00:03:18.780> you're

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
important part of it because when you're

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.020 
important part of it because when you're
in<00:03:20.109> shoulder<00:03:20.859> mode<00:03:21.100> or<00:03:21.670> neck<00:03:22.600> mode<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:24.190> puppy

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
in shoulder mode or neck mode the puppy

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.430 
in shoulder mode or neck mode the puppy
hammer<00:03:25.209> gets<00:03:25.450> really<00:03:25.660> close<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.230> ground

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
hammer gets really close to the ground

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.000 
hammer gets really close to the ground
and<00:03:26.970> any<00:03:27.970> any<00:03:28.480> longer<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.470> starts<00:03:29.829> to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and any any longer and it starts to

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.340 
and any any longer and it starts to
really<00:03:30.280> become<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.970> an<00:03:31.389> issue<00:03:31.569> with<00:03:31.870> surface

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
really become a an issue with surface

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.050 
really become a an issue with surface
grade<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:32.829> raising<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.549> ground<00:03:33.760> or<00:03:33.970> just

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
grade like raising the ground or just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.300 
grade like raising the ground or just
hitting<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> ground<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.139> lot<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> time

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
hitting the ground and a lot of the time

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.830 
hitting the ground and a lot of the time
you'll<00:03:36.459> hit<00:03:36.579> your<00:03:36.639> feet<00:03:37.030> if<00:03:37.299> you're<00:03:37.450> wearing

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
you'll hit your feet if you're wearing

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.379 
you'll hit your feet if you're wearing
like<00:03:37.959> boots<00:03:38.260> or<00:03:38.470> something<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.060> I

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
like boots or something like that so I

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.910 
like boots or something like that so I
would<00:03:40.569> definitely<00:03:41.019> recommend<00:03:41.139> at<00:03:41.680> least

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
would definitely recommend at least

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.120 
would definitely recommend at least
start<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:43.260> having<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.350> hang<00:03:44.590> down<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.010> your

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
start with having it hang down to your

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.979 
start with having it hang down to your
elbow<00:03:45.519> on<00:03:45.760> either<00:03:46.090> side<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.989> also

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
elbow on either side like this I also

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.360 
elbow on either side like this I also
have<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.819> this<00:03:51.819> modular<00:03:52.660> fire<00:03:52.959> one<00:03:53.370> right

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
have this this modular fire one right

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.210 
have this this modular fire one right
here<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:56.170> way<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.410> works<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:56.829> exactly

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
here and the way this works it's exactly

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.449 
here and the way this works it's exactly
the<00:03:57.400> same<00:03:57.639> as<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.180> other<00:03:58.299> one

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the same as the other one

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.759 
the same as the other one
it<00:04:01.060> doesn't<00:04:01.510> have<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.840> pointy<00:04:02.140> part<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.590> you

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
it doesn't have the pointy part so you

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.500 
it doesn't have the pointy part so you
can<00:04:02.980> see<00:04:03.129> here<00:04:03.340> like<00:04:03.459> if<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.730> hold<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:06.510> see

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
can see here like if I hold it I see

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.140 
can see here like if I hold it I see
with<00:04:07.659> my<00:04:07.689> hands<00:04:08.200> stretched<00:04:09.040> out<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.549> just<00:04:09.999> have

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
with my hands stretched out I just have

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.530 
with my hands stretched out I just have
ends<00:04:10.659> but<00:04:11.439> if<00:04:11.560> I've<00:04:12.459> tied<00:04:12.849> these<00:04:13.030> little<00:04:13.329> quick

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
ends but if I've tied these little quick

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.409 
ends but if I've tied these little quick
links<00:04:13.900> on<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.709> ends<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:17.500> can<00:04:17.680> see<00:04:17.859> here

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
links on to the ends you can see here

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.950 
links on to the ends you can see here
little<00:04:19.419> quick<00:04:19.599> links<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.720> these<00:04:22.870> quick<00:04:23.199> links

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
little quick links so these quick links

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.110

enable me to attach glow and fire heads
to<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> ends<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.940> pair<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.240> fire<00:04:32.110> poi

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
to the ends so I have a pair of fire poi

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.339 
to the ends so I have a pair of fire poi
and<00:04:33.150> some<00:04:34.150> low<00:04:34.690> heads<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.970> are<00:04:37.240> exactly<00:04:38.169> the

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
and some low heads that are exactly the

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.230 
and some low heads that are exactly the
same<00:04:38.380> length<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:39.160> have<00:04:39.190> my<00:04:39.430> handles<00:04:39.820> on<00:04:39.910> my<00:04:40.030> fire

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
same length I have my handles on my fire

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.580 
same length I have my handles on my fire
poi<00:04:40.509> right<00:04:40.720> now<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:40.990> if<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.139> would<00:04:41.199> take<00:04:41.440> them

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
poi right now but if I would take them

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.370 
poi right now but if I would take them
off<00:04:41.740> for<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.310> puppy<00:04:42.880> hammer<00:04:43.090> part<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:44.020> you

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
off for the puppy hammer part but you

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.570 
off for the puppy hammer part but you
can<00:04:44.470> see<00:04:44.560> they're<00:04:44.680> exactly<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.099> same<00:04:45.190> length

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
can see they're exactly the same length

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
can see they're exactly the same length
and<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:48.039> I<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:50.800> just<00:04:51.180> slip<00:04:52.180> these<00:04:52.830> these

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
and so I can just slip these these

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.219 
and so I can just slip these these
attachment<00:04:54.370> points<00:04:54.400> on<00:04:54.789> to<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.750> quick<00:04:55.930> links

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
attachment points on to the quick links

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.930 
attachment points on to the quick links
and<00:04:56.380> then<00:04:56.470> screw<00:04:56.770> them<00:04:56.919> tight<00:04:57.099> make<00:04:57.729> sure<00:04:57.759> to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
and then screw them tight make sure to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.640 
and then screw them tight make sure to
check<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.270> quick<00:04:58.780> links<00:04:59.080> because<00:04:59.259> they<00:04:59.380> tend

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
check the quick links because they tend

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:09.020 
check the quick links because they tend
to<00:04:59.770> undo<00:05:01.110> sometimes<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:03.520> fire<00:05:03.729> head<00:05:06.930> so

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
to undo sometimes the fire head so

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.870 
to undo sometimes the fire head so
that's<00:05:10.030> pretty<00:05:10.210> much<00:05:10.300> it

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.910 

Oh
