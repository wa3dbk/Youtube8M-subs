00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.380
 So from Moses and the prophets 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.040
 Everyone who has pointed to himself will explain to them. 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.520
 (Luke 24:27) 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.556
 What is the Bible about? 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.060
 The Bible is basically about me and what should I do? 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.140
 Still about Jesus and what has He done? 

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.727
 When you read Luke and Acts 

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.947
 Forty days before Jesus ascended to heaven 

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:34.087
 When God is with the disciples 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.040
 What did He do? 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.360
 Basically He said: Everything in the Old Testament is about me! 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.040
 This is why you don’t understand and don’t know who I am. 

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.350
 Everything in the Prophets, Psalms, and Law books points to me! 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.316
 Do you believe that the Bible is basically about you? 

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.401
 Or is it basically about Him? 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.120
 The story of David Stone is about you and how you are like David. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.260
 Still basically about him 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.000
 The one who really took away the sins we committed, the only one who can kill us. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.800
 Then give us his victory? 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.660
 Who are these narratives of the Bible? This is the fundamental problem! 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960
 When I read the Bible again 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 Jesus is a true and better Adam. He passed the test of the Garden of Eden. 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 And attribute His obedience to us 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.440
 Jesus is a real and better Abel 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.640
 Passing his blood through a sinless victim (Gen. 4:10) 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.900
 Not to condemn us but to pronounce us innocent 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.060
 Jesus is a real and better Abraham 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.300
 He responded to the call of God 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 Leave all the comfort and familiar things 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.980
 Go to the unknown wilderness to respond to the call of God 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.340
 Jesus is true and better Isaac 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.460
 Not only being brought to the mountain by his father to sacrifice 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 And also truly sacrifice for us 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.980
 So God said to Abraham: "Now I know that you love me. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.520
 Because you have not left the beloved son you have obtained from me. (Genesis 22:12) 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.080
 Now that we have a cross, we can say to God: 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.280
 "Now we know that you love me because you don't have a lonely child." 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.500
 Jesus is a real and better Jacob 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 Wrestle with God and bear the blow of justice we deserve 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.100
 So we are like Jacob. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.280
 Only receive the wounds of grace, wake up and discipline us. 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.480
 Jesus is a real and better Joseph 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.180
 Forgive those who betrayed and sold Him on the right side of the king 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 Also use His new power to save them 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.756
 Jesus is a real and better Moses 

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.349
 Standing in the gap between man and God and introducing the New Testament 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.869
 Jesus is a real and better meteor (called by Moses) 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.388
 When he was beaten by the rod of God's righteousness, he gave us living water in the desert. 

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.868
 Jesus is a real and better Job 

00:02:37.868 --> 00:02:41.748
 The true sinless victim also prays for and saves their friends 

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:43.548
 Jesus is a true and better David 

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:45.748
 Turning his own victory into the victory of His people 

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.748
 Even though the people have never done anything for victory. 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.188
 Jesus is a real and better Esther 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.720
 Not just risking the loss of a worldly palace 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.673
 Is risking the loss of the ultimate palace in heaven 

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.173
 It is not just risking the loss of one's own life but also giving His life to save His people. 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.280
 Not just saying, "If I die, I will die (S 4:16) 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.880
 It is to say that when I die, to save them - my people die. " 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.640
 Jesus is a real and better Jonah 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 Being thrown into the storm so that we can enter the kingdom of heaven 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.780
 He is the true Lamb of Passover 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 He is the true true pastor of the true temple, the true king 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.340
 True sacrifice, true lamb, true light and true spiritual food 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.280
 The Bible is not about you! 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.185
 Mainly about Jesus 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:38.560
 The meaning of ministry: The core of each sermon must revolve around who Jesus is and what He does.
