00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
link and if you're watching this right

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.540 
link and if you're watching this right
now<00:00:17.760> then<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.660> believe<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> reason<00:00:20.279> why

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
now then I believe that the reason why

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.040 
now then I believe that the reason why
it's<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:20.880> working<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:24.050> uploaded

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it's not working is because I uploaded

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.200 
it's not working is because I uploaded
this<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> Mac<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> are<00:00:26.609> using<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.000> Dell

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
this in a Mac and you are using a Dell

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
this in a Mac and you are using a Dell
computer<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> reason<00:00:29.250> why<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
computer I think that's the reason why I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.479 
computer I think that's the reason why I
tried<00:00:30.500> downloading<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:31.890> Dell<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
tried downloading this on my Dell and it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.819 
tried downloading this on my Dell and it
does<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> Mac

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this clip goes up if it doesn't and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140 
this clip goes up if it doesn't and
would<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.900> pretty<00:01:40.200> disappointing<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.340> well

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
would be pretty disappointing but well

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.889 
would be pretty disappointing but well
actually<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.729> Mac<00:01:45.000> then

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
actually just I if you have a Mac then

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.130 
actually just I if you have a Mac then
that<00:01:46.170> would<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.290> great<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.479> yeah<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that would be great that yeah that's the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
that would be great that yeah that's the
reason<00:01:49.259> why<00:01:51.320> yeah<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.649> megaupload<00:01:53.070> thing

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
reason why yeah the megaupload thing
