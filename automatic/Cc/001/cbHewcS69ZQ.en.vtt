 Finally, there is a gift voucher 3 that said earlier that is not ideal at 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.249
 own field 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.189
 this just a little when you first see the common man more in the room 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.460
 what in the cupboard 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.489
 I've had it since the mat 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.869
 I have learned everything in the room in the room when everything is behind me 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.480
 if you have it 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.180
 well should not say what it says I can now be anp next Monday 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.749

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 if I am not allowed 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.330
 well on that not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 fallen into the water 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 I know what I can do 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.880
 Denmark 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.150
 die 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 people what is important and add but it seems even more important 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.040
 well rights watch yes I understand 3 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.250
 it really doesn't make me 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.050
 the left back sambeek mark zuckerberg 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.520
 we try we look if you don't know 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 he runs the risk 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.160
 this clinic on me with links 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.760
 meters away 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.430
 considering the leg 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.890
 but the fast 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 her name is on it but they did not come 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.960
 the supermarkets 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.050
 not at all 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.930
 also more for questioning 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.270
 how much brussels it must do 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 dpa afp 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 Yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 it is obvious 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 the start I have not seen filipo pozzato 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.179
 I thought I read 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.819
 hasselt the other three points 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.009

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.799
 there a garden 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.799
 but I think essential recordings are really strong 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.659
 I see you 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.659
 bielefeld 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.079
