00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
on g2 226 da recently installed it into

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.269 
on g2 226 da recently installed it into
my<00:00:10.800> stager<00:00:14.179> have<00:00:15.179> Japanese<00:00:15.780> spec<00:00:16.279> carrozzeria

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
my stager have Japanese spec carrozzeria

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.720 
my stager have Japanese spec carrozzeria
in<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:17.970> which<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:19.460> impossible<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.640> me<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
in there which was impossible for me to

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340 
in there which was impossible for me to
operate<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.390> limited<00:00:21.810> Japanese

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
operate with my limited Japanese

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.509 
operate with my limited Japanese
knowledge<00:00:22.769> side<00:00:24.470> yeah<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.830> I've<00:00:26.220> installed

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
knowledge side yeah so I've installed

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.169 
knowledge side yeah so I've installed
this<00:00:26.760> everything<00:00:27.630> works<00:00:27.840> except<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
this everything works except for the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
this everything works except for the
reverse<00:00:30.179> camera<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:31.230> there's<00:00:32.070> something

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
reverse camera I think there's something

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.810 
reverse camera I think there's something
up<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.910> arm<00:00:33.680> power<00:00:34.680> source<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
up with my arm power source for that so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.100 
up with my arm power source for that so
need<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> investigate<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.710> anyway<00:00:38.840> here's<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
need to investigate so anyway here's the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.270 
need to investigate so anyway here's the
main<00:00:40.620> interface<00:00:42.559> scroll<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.800> forth

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
main interface scroll back and forth

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.319 
main interface scroll back and forth
it's<00:00:45.149> very<00:00:45.329> nice<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.710> update<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.329> have

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's very nice you can update it to have

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
it's very nice you can update it to have
a<00:00:48.420> different<00:00:48.629> way<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.399> this<00:00:52.309> too<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:54.090> scroll

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a different way so this too can scroll

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.340 
a different way so this too can scroll

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
signal you'd have to specify a baud rate

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.810 
signal you'd have to specify a baud rate
of<00:01:46.259> 4800<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> after<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> worked<00:01:49.470> fine
