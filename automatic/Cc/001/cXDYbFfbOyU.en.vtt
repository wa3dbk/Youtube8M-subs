00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
effective eyeliner so this is basically

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.409

what<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.770> dark<00:04:48.010> eyeshadow<00:04:48.250> will<00:04:48.730> do<00:04:48.910> for<00:04:49.240> you

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
what the dark eyeshadow will do for you

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.380 
what the dark eyeshadow will do for you
just<00:04:50.200> like<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:51.520> next<00:04:51.820> step<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.180> go

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
just like that the next step is to go

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.720 
just like that the next step is to go
into<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.960> bronzy<00:04:53.500> color<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.830> use<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.340> my<00:04:54.370> lid

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
into that bronzy color I use in my lid

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.370 
into that bronzy color I use in my lid
and<00:04:54.970> think<00:04:55.210> apply<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.600> all<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:55.990> my<00:04:56.140> lower

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
and think apply that all on my lower

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:05.460 
and think apply that all on my lower
lash<00:04:56.680> line<00:04:56.980> so<00:04:57.880> right<00:04:58.330> below<00:04:59.310> my<00:05:00.310> lashes

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.570 

wouldn't<00:05:06.470> be<00:05:06.530> applying<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.040> top<00:05:07.310> color

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
wouldn't be applying the top color

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.170 
wouldn't be applying the top color
shadow<00:05:07.910> on<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:09.170> outer<00:05:09.320> third<00:05:11.500> can<00:05:12.500> really

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
shadow on the outer third can really

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:21.169 
shadow on the outer third can really
emphasize<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.210> outer<00:05:14.870> corner<00:05:15.320> color

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:21.179 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:23.579 

so<00:05:22.179> the<00:05:22.299> next<00:05:22.449> step<00:05:22.569> is<00:05:22.749> really<00:05:22.989> super<00:05:23.289> simple

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:23.589 
so the next step is really super simple

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.859 
so the next step is really super simple
kernel<00:05:24.009> lashes<00:05:24.459> and<00:05:24.759> apply<00:05:24.849> your<00:05:25.479> favorite

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:25.869 
kernel lashes and apply your favorite

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:40.570 
kernel lashes and apply your favorite
mascara

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.550 

in<00:05:40.819> this<00:05:41.300> stuff<00:05:41.509> I<00:05:41.599> also<00:05:41.780> like<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.080> emphasize

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
in this stuff I also like to emphasize

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.749 
in this stuff I also like to emphasize
my<00:05:42.740> lower<00:05:43.009> lash<00:05:43.310> line<00:05:45.370> so<00:05:46.370> I'm<00:05:46.520> going<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.669> be

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759
