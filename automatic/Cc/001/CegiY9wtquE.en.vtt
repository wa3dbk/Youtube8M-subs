00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
I'm also going to add a good tablespoon

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.719

know<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> fork<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.220> why<00:01:41.400> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
know just with a fork and this is why I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.740 
know just with a fork and this is why I
let<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.360> soft<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.680> becomes<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.220> easier

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
let it get soft this becomes much easier

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
let it get soft this becomes much easier
I<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> mix<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.159> together<00:01:47.310> mash

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I just kind of mix it all together mash

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840
