galaxy note 3 okay so the first rumour
sucks<00:00:19.920> point<00:00:20.250> 6<00:00:20.609> inches<00:00:20.970> well<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.199> seems

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
sucks point 6 inches well that seems

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.370 
sucks point 6 inches well that seems
pretty<00:00:22.769> big<00:00:23.010> doesn't<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.369> bet<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:24.420> let's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pretty big doesn't it bet actually let's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.779 
pretty big doesn't it bet actually let's
have<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> look<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.130> let's<00:00:26.369> compare<00:00:26.699> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
have a look at it and let's compare it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.230 
have a look at it and let's compare it
to<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> note<00:00:27.090> 1<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.710> purely<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> six<00:00:30.000> point

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to the note 1 it is purely a six point

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
to the note 1 it is purely a six point
three<00:00:30.390> inch<00:00:30.779> display<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.769> that's<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
three inch display so that's from the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.880 
three inch display so that's from the
edge<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.669> display<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> diagonal<00:00:34.559> other

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
edge of display to the diagonal other

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.000 
edge of display to the diagonal other
each<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> display<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
each of the display right now is this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
each of the display right now is this
possible<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> huge

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
possible is this going to be a huge

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.799 
possible is this going to be a huge
device<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> old<00:00:41.809> metric

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
device so I got the old metric

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
device so I got the old metric
centimeter<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.500> about<00:00:43.680> sorry<00:00:43.980> Americans<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
centimeter all about sorry Americans is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
centimeter all about sorry Americans is
not<00:00:44.820> inches<00:00:46.460> six<00:00:47.460> point<00:00:47.700> three<00:00:47.730> inches<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> 16

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
not inches six point three inches is 16

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.290 
not inches six point three inches is 16
centimeters<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.700> note<00:00:50.969> 1<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.840> exactly

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
centimeters and the note 1 is exactly

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.220 
centimeters and the note 1 is exactly
16.2<00:00:54.530> centimeters<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.660> note<00:00:57.840> 3

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
16.2 centimeters but i think the note 3

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.540 
16.2 centimeters but i think the note 3
will<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.609> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.359> manga<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
will probably be a little bit manga and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
will probably be a little bit manga and
not<00:01:02.550> quite<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.879> wide<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> same

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
not quite as wide so that is the same

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.920 
not quite as wide so that is the same
sort<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> ratio<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> note<00:01:05.460> 2<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> we're

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
sort of ratio as the note 2 so we're

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.210 
sort of ratio as the note 2 so we're
going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> safely<00:01:07.500> assume<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.130> going

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
going to safely assume that it's going

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
going to safely assume that it's going
to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> 1080p<00:01:08.850> display<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
to be a 1080p display and because of the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
to be a 1080p display and because of the
size<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> screen<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> resolution

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
size of the screen and the resolution

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
size of the screen and the resolution
you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.330> safely<00:01:13.260> assume<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you can safely assume it's going to be

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.929 
you can safely assume it's going to be
mid<00:01:14.400> 400<00:01:14.939> dpi<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.220> Korean<00:01:17.670> Times

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mid 400 dpi I think the Korean Times

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.410 
mid 400 dpi I think the Korean Times
quoted<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.780> 441<00:01:19.560> DPO<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> galaxy<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
quoted at 441 DPO for the galaxy is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.950 
quoted at 441 DPO for the galaxy is
fourth<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:23.189> stated<00:01:23.820> three<00:01:24.479> gigs<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.100 
ram and 120 gigabytes of internal
storage<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.939> I'm<00:01:29.939> slightly<00:01:30.270> beefed<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.780> from

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
storage so I'm slightly beefed up from

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.100 
storage so I'm slightly beefed up from
the<00:01:31.350> Galaxy<00:01:32.040> Note<00:01:32.070> 2<00:01:32.540> now<00:01:33.540> I'd<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:33.930> love<00:01:34.049> to

the power button like we do at the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.230 
the power button like we do at the
moment<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> concept<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
moment so yeah this is the concept of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
moment so yeah this is the concept of
where<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.479> could<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.780> we're<00:01:49.320> cool<00:01:49.439> now

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
where it could look like we're cool now
