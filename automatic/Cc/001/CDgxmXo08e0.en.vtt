didn't really capture the first part of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.289 
didn't really capture the first part of
this<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> didn't<00:00:14.610> really<00:00:14.730> miss<00:00:14.940> much<00:00:15.150> on

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
this but you didn't really miss much on

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.480 
this but you didn't really miss much on
anything<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.630> get<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.929> many<00:00:16.109> kills<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:17.250> i'm

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
anything I get that many kills but i'm

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.090 
anything I get that many kills but i'm
using<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.119> pp<00:00:18.810> whatever<00:00:19.199> i<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
using the pp whatever i really like this

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
using the pp whatever i really like this
submachine<00:00:21.029> gun<00:00:21.359> i<00:00:21.449> think<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
submachine gun i think it's one of the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.519 
submachine gun i think it's one of the
best<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.619> i<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:24.000> Infinity<00:00:24.720> Ward<00:00:25.320> did

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
best but i think what Infinity Ward did

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
best but i think what Infinity Ward did
with<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> guns<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.430> did<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.910> really

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
with the guns I think they did a really

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.960 
with the guns I think they did a really
good<00:00:27.689> job<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:28.109> making<00:00:28.710> them<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.789> good

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
good job at making them all really good

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849 
good job at making them all really good
because<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.300> haven't<00:00:30.480> i've<00:00:30.960> used<00:00:31.410> quite<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> lot

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because I haven't i've used quite a lot

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
because I haven't i've used quite a lot
of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> guns<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:32.700> told<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.300> some

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
of the guns like I've told you in some

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
of the guns like I've told you in some
of<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.719> previous<00:00:33.960> videos<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.610> that's

of my previous videos and I think that's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270 
of my previous videos and I think that's

and that is trying to have fun in this
game<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.340> I've<00:00:44.579> there's<00:00:44.940> been<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
game now I've there's been a lot of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.799 
game now I've there's been a lot of
complaining<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.210> know<00:00:48.210> it's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
complaining about this and you know it's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.220 
complaining about this and you know it's
in<00:00:49.289> human<00:00:49.770> nature<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.100> complain<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.329> really

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
in human nature to complain but I really

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
in human nature to complain but I really
think<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.280> better

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
think that this is one of the better

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
think that this is one of the better
better<00:00:54.539> games<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> call<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> duty

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
better games out of the call of duty

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.920 
better games out of the call of duty
series<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> best<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
series and I think that the best way to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.680 
series and I think that the best way to
have<00:00:58.500> fun<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.640> care<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.480> much

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
have fun is just to not care pretty much

to have fun in the game like this is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
to have fun in the game like this is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
just not worry about that i mean there's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
just not worry about that i mean there's
been<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> stressing<00:01:12.630> over<00:01:12.720> stats<00:01:13.439> like

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
been a lot of stressing over stats like

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
been a lot of stressing over stats like
that<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.659> care

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
but then I realized i went to the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.569 
but then I realized i went to the
private<00:03:54.930> lobby<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:55.890> actually<00:03:56.070> looked<00:03:56.459> at

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
all of them and they'll I realized that

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770
