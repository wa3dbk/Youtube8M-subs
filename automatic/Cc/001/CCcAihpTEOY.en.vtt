00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so for instance you know the arm only

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
so for instance you know the arm only
bends<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> mean<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.650> guys

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
here so we can see that so for instance

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
here so we can see that so for instance
don't<00:01:14.760> his<00:01:15.060> arm<00:01:15.240> only<00:01:15.479> bends<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.049> okay

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
it's just really an adult um exercise

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.650 
it's just really an adult um exercise
it's<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:24.070> an<00:03:24.250> individual<00:03:24.820> by<00:03:25.180> individual

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
it's on an individual by individual

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.599 
it's on an individual by individual
basis<00:03:26.079> really<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.709> do<00:03:26.829> this<00:03:26.980> art<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.310> more<00:03:27.549> of

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
basis really to do this art is more of

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.720 
basis really to do this art is more of
an<00:03:27.700> adult<00:03:27.970> art<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:29.019> really<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.280> wouldn't

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
an adult art so really I wouldn't

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.340 
an adult art so really I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:30.970> anybody<00:03:31.510> too<00:03:31.810> much<00:03:31.959> younger<00:03:32.170> than

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
recommend anybody too much younger than

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.319 
recommend anybody too much younger than

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
probably 13 because you have to have a

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.530 
probably 13 because you have to have a
certain<00:03:34.600> level<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.430> concentration<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.030> some
