you had us all worried we have other

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.630 
you had us all worried we have other
things<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.740> worry<00:05:03.010> about

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
things to worry about

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.610 
things to worry about
I<00:05:03.670> picked<00:05:04.270> up<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.540> lot<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:04.720> data<00:05:05.080> while<00:05:05.350> locked

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
I picked up a lot of data while locked

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.010 
I picked up a lot of data while locked
in<00:05:05.800> me<00:05:05.890> orb<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.460> analyze<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.360> with<00:05:07.480> duplex

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
in me orb I analyze it with duplex

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.540 
in me orb I analyze it with duplex
algorithms<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.860> now<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:08.980> think<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:09.400> know<00:05:09.460> just

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
algorithms and now I think I know just

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.670 
algorithms and now I think I know just
