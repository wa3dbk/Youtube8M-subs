00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
much like the other iteration just got

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
much like the other iteration just got
through<00:00:24.689> suspension<00:00:25.109> tweaks<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.310> got<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> bit

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
through suspension tweaks it's got a bit

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.279 
through suspension tweaks it's got a bit
more<00:00:26.820> pair<00:00:27.119> although<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.660> won't<00:00:27.810> tell<00:00:28.109> us

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
more pair although they won't tell us

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.040 
more pair although they won't tell us
like<00:00:28.949> quite<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> power<00:00:30.300> output<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.810> yet

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like quite what the power output is yet

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.220 
like quite what the power output is yet
we're<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:32.540> 545<00:00:33.540> something<00:00:34.110> like

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
we're actually about 545 something like

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430 
we're actually about 545 something like
that<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.110> pretty<00:00:37.110> wet

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that and we're here on a pretty wet

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.940 
that and we're here on a pretty wet
Silverson<00:00:38.160> track<00:00:38.489> trying<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.950> let's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Silverson track trying it out and let's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.330 
Silverson track trying it out and let's
be<00:00:41.070> honest<00:00:42.440> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.530> are<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> drive<00:00:44.040> any

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
car on a wet race track it would be the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.510 
car on a wet race track it would be the
GTR<00:00:47.989> with<00:00:48.989> its<00:00:49.140> all-wheel<00:00:49.410> drive<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
but even now it's super slippy coming

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.599 
but even now it's super slippy coming
into<00:00:59.870> this<00:00:59.989> corner<00:01:00.379> here<00:01:00.530> see<00:01:01.010> how<00:01:01.100> careful<00:01:01.550> I

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
into this corner here see how careful I

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.329 
into this corner here see how careful I
got<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.820> pee<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.269> on<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.199> exit

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
got to pee and on the exit

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.370 
got to pee and on the exit
oh<00:01:05.890> that's<00:01:06.890> control<00:01:07.340> cutting<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:07.990> I'm<00:01:08.990> only<00:01:09.170> on

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.279 
oh that's control cutting in I'm only on
my<00:01:09.469> second<00:01:09.829> lap<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.250> thought<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:10.869> better<00:01:11.869> not

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
my second lap so I thought I better not

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.260 
my second lap so I thought I better not
ruin<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.579> only<00:01:13.670> car<00:01:14.000> here

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
ruin it and this is the only car here

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.539 
ruin it and this is the only car here
today<00:01:14.630> only<00:01:15.500> car<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.950> country<00:01:16.399> at<00:01:16.490> the

today only car in the country at the

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.910 
today only car in the country at the
moment<00:01:16.579> so<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.569> don't<00:01:17.780> have<00:01:17.899> ruin<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.319> in<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
moment so I don't have ruin it in the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.180 
moment so I don't have ruin it in the
first<00:01:19.159> corner

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.070 

can<00:01:27.730> actually<00:01:28.180> feel<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.630> little<00:01:28.900> bit<00:01:29.050> of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
can actually feel that little bit of

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.070 
can actually feel that little bit of
extra<00:01:29.230> power<00:01:29.770> we've<00:01:30.490> also<00:01:30.670> got<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.090> 2011

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
extra power we've also got the 2011

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.690 
extra power we've also got the 2011
model<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:32.770> for<00:01:32.890> comparison<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.490> drove

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
model here just for comparison I drove

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.940 
model here just for comparison I drove
back<00:01:33.910> just<00:01:34.510> a<00:01:34.600> minute<00:01:34.840> ago<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.650> just<00:01:35.830> feels

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
back just a minute ago and it just feels

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.320 
back just a minute ago and it just feels
a<00:01:36.100> little<00:01:36.250> bit<00:01:36.430> more<00:01:36.550> urgent<00:01:37.030> through<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
a little bit more urgent through the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.600 
a little bit more urgent through the
gears<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.720> mean<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.260> tiny<00:01:38.770> margins<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.490> a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
gears I mean it is a tiny margins it's a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.630 
gears I mean it is a tiny margins it's a
seriously<00:01:39.970> fast<00:01:40.210> car<00:01:40.510> anyway<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:42.400> one

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
seriously fast car anyway but this one

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.400 
seriously fast car anyway but this one
really<00:01:42.880> seemed<00:01:43.480> when<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.870> gets<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.230> about

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
really seemed when it gets up to about

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.570 
really seemed when it gets up to about
five<00:01:44.860> since<00:01:45.190> then

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.360 

say<00:01:52.370> it<00:01:53.370> just<00:01:53.610> feels<00:01:54.800> like<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.830> rear-wheel

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
say it just feels like a rear-wheel

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.100 
say it just feels like a rear-wheel
drive<00:01:56.550> car<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.150> these<00:01:57.300> conditions<00:01:57.540> but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
drive car in these conditions but

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.010 
drive car in these conditions but
feel<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.740> power<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:01.150> seems<00:02:01.480> your<00:02:01.690> point<00:02:01.900> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
feel that power it seems your point in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
feel that power it seems your point in
the<00:02:02.290> highway<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.610> floor<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.910> throttle

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the highway and you floor the throttle

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.610 
the highway and you floor the throttle
oh<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.690> takes<00:02:07.080> your<00:02:07.260> breath<00:02:07.320> away

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
oh well it just takes your breath away

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:16.000 
oh well it just takes your breath away
this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.100> sensational<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.910> i<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> say

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
this is sensational but i have to say

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.750 
this is sensational but i have to say
shorter<00:02:17.010> perhaps<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.760> false<00:02:18.090> 911<00:02:18.360> turbo<00:02:19.140> I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
shorter perhaps a false 911 turbo I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.590 
shorter perhaps a false 911 turbo I
can't<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.000> anything<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.450> would

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
can't think of anything that would

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.220 
can't think of anything that would
negotiate<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.560> wet<00:02:23.040> Silsden<00:02:23.640> quicker<00:02:24.170> ok<00:02:25.170> we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
negotiate a wet Silsden quicker ok we
