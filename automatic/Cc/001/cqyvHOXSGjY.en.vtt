factor here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.529 
factor here
it's<00:00:28.670> nothing<00:00:29.670> too<00:00:29.849> fancy<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.300> basically

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's nothing too fancy it's basically

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.030 
it's nothing too fancy it's basically
the<00:00:30.990> most<00:00:31.170> important<00:00:31.470> part<00:00:31.590> that's<00:00:31.769> probably

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the most important part that's probably

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
the most important part that's probably
got<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.309> yeah<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.700> got<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> draw<00:00:33.090> extension<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
got it yeah it's got a draw extension so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
got it yeah it's got a draw extension so
and<00:00:34.200> probably<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> plunger<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.250> sticks<00:00:35.610> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and probably a plunger on sticks in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270 
and probably a plunger on sticks in
further<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.059> usual<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:37.469> didn't<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.129> anything

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
further than usual I didn't do anything

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
further than usual I didn't do anything
too<00:00:38.489> fancy<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.300> simply<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.690> move

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
too fancy to do that I simply just move

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.760 
too fancy to do that I simply just move
plunger<00:00:40.440> tube<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> shell

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
plunger tube up with the in the shell

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.110 
plunger tube up with the in the shell
dremel<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.860> crap<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> front<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
dremel do crap in front right there and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
dremel do crap in front right there and
then<00:00:45.469> basically<00:00:46.820> something<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> ton<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
then basically something like a ton of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
then basically something like a ton of
hot<00:00:48.480> glue<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.140> staple<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.739> tube

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
hot glue in here to staple of your tube

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
hot glue in here to staple of your tube
in<00:00:50.070> place<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.579> stuck<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> coupling<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> end

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in place and stuck a coupling on the end

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
in place and stuck a coupling on the end
here<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:55.699> yeah<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here and there you go so yeah and then I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
here and there you go so yeah and then I
obviously<00:00:57.600> minimized<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.350> well<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
obviously minimized it as well so that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
obviously minimized it as well so that
way<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.550> looks<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.789> cleaner<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> close<00:01:01.649> up

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
way it looks like cleaner and I close up

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.500 
way it looks like cleaner and I close up
the<00:01:01.890> gap<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.270> just

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the gap here you can see that's just

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
the gap here you can see that's just
duct<00:01:03.660> tape<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.739> make

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
duct tape right here so that's to make

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
duct tape right here so that's to make
it<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.159> neater<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.470> overall<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it look a little neater but overall I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
it look a little neater but overall I
think<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.979> looks<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.310> nice<00:01:08.640> because

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think actually looks really nice because

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
think actually looks really nice because
it<00:01:09.659> looks<00:01:09.810> especially<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.920> garage<00:01:11.070> station

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

inch<00:01:41.700> rattle<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.119> I've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> speed

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
inch rattle so I've got like a speed

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.069 
inch rattle so I've got like a speed
loader<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.540> syringes<00:01:45.899> are

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
loader right here and the syringes are

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
loader right here and the syringes are
pretty<00:01:46.590> decent<00:01:46.770> especially<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.670> knife

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
pretty decent especially for a knife

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.359 
pretty decent especially for a knife
line<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.390> probably<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.710> around<00:01:49.890> 75

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
line there it's probably it's around 75

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
line there it's probably it's around 75
feet<00:01:50.549> flat<00:01:50.850> edge<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.270> still<00:01:52.020> sort<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
feet flat edge which is still sort of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
feet flat edge which is still sort of
right<00:01:52.680> around<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> upper<00:01:53.040> threat<00:01:53.460> role<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.080 
right around the upper threat role of a
pistol<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.130> okay<00:01:56.130> well<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> seals<00:01:56.640> quite<00:01:56.909> well

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
pistol so okay well it seals quite well

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.639 
pistol so okay well it seals quite well
as<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.740> see<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.979> yeah<00:02:01.979> dcz<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.909> go

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
is messy sitting here is a lot by jolt

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.320 
is messy sitting here is a lot by jolt
so<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> ever<00:02:15.090> seen<00:02:15.270> this

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
before this is the the Nano Jules mod

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.150 
before this is the the Nano Jules mod
that's<00:02:18.450> leadership<00:02:19.050> revision<00:02:19.650> 5<00:02:22.160> so

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that's leadership revision 5 so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.460 
that's leadership revision 5 so
basically<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> did<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.180> obviously<00:02:24.750> cut

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
basically what I did was obviously cut

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.960 
basically what I did was obviously cut
down<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.160> normal<00:02:26.370> barrel<00:02:26.670> better<00:02:26.790> come

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
down the the normal barrel better come

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.150 
down the the normal barrel better come
out<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> side<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.110> instead<00:02:28.740> made<00:02:29.040> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
out the side here and instead made it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.850 
out the side here and instead made it
sort<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.430> an<00:02:29.490> inline<00:02:29.850> sort<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.860> streamlined

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
sort of an inline sort of streamlined

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740 
sort of an inline sort of streamlined
look<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:33.300> got<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> coupler

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
look and that it's got the coupler

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
look and that it's got the coupler
sticking<00:02:34.020> up<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> barrel<00:02:34.770> right

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
sticking up here in the barrel right

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.350 
sticking up here in the barrel right
here<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.800> trigger<00:02:38.100> setup<00:02:38.520> obviously

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
here and the trigger setup obviously

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.190 
here and the trigger setup obviously
before<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:41.250> sort<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.670> catch<00:02:42.020> some<00:02:43.020> catch

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
before it's the sort of catch some catch

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.660 
before it's the sort of catch some catch
spring<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> catch<00:02:44.070> for<00:02:44.310> sword<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
spring it's like a catch for sword it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.160 
spring it's like a catch for sword it
was<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> piece<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.450> plastic<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.840> bench

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
was like a piece of plastic that bench

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290 
was like a piece of plastic that bench
and<00:02:46.290> allowed<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.680> catch<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.209> I've

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and allowed it to catch so what I've

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.150 
and allowed it to catch so what I've
done<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.780> I've<00:02:49.020> replaced<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> spring<00:02:49.950> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
done is I've replaced with a spring so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.250 
done is I've replaced with a spring so
now<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.400> allows<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.750> still<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.110> gijón

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
now it allows it to it's still in gijón

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.310 
now it allows it to it's still in gijón
the<00:02:52.380> same<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:53.030> bolts<00:02:54.030> or<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:55.080> whatever

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the same little bolts or and whatever

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320 
the same little bolts or and whatever
they<00:02:55.620> put<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.550> it's<00:02:56.700> dead<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.090> uses

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
they put in there but it's dead it uses

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.960 
they put in there but it's dead it uses
a<00:02:57.360> spring<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:58.530> guide<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.790> same<00:02:59.940> way

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
a spring to guide it in the same way

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.420 
a spring to guide it in the same way
sort<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.360> way<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.540> snap<00:03:00.840> works<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:02.100> get<00:03:02.250> close

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
sort of way and snap works you get close

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.460 
sort of way and snap works you get close
I<00:03:02.580> don't<00:03:02.610> even<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.380> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
I don't even see you here but there's a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.380 
I don't even see you here but there's a
spring<00:03:04.890> inside<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.550> which<00:03:05.970> pushes<00:03:06.270> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
spring inside there which pushes the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.620 
spring inside there which pushes the
trigger<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.020> down<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.330> obviously

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
trigger up and down and so obviously

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.760 
trigger up and down and so obviously
it's<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> couple<00:03:10.140> arrow<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.410> stuck<00:03:10.650> on

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's a couple arrow that I stuck on

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's a couple arrow that I stuck on
front<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.160> couldn't<00:03:11.430> black<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> plunger

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
front I couldn't black and the plunger

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.940 
front I couldn't black and the plunger
on<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.200> also<00:03:13.470> painted<00:03:13.980> black<00:03:14.160> only<00:03:15.000> because

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
on I also painted black only because

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.050 
on I also painted black only because
originally<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.250> plunger<00:03:17.489> rod<00:03:17.610> comes<00:03:17.850> like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
originally the plunger rod comes like

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.660 
originally the plunger rod comes like
kind<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.590> grayish<00:03:19.590> almost<00:03:20.070> even<00:03:20.250> brownish

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
kind of a grayish almost even brownish

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.100 
kind of a grayish almost even brownish
color

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
color

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.470 
color
I<00:03:22.110> don't<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.730> always<00:03:23.880> what<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.420> of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I don't know that always what kind of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.580 
I don't know that always what kind of
weird<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.690> me<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> was<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.200> could<00:03:25.320> look<00:03:25.440> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
weird to me I was we could look really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.550 
weird to me I was we could look really
cool<00:03:25.799> black<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.660> did<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.049> do

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
cool black and so I did it and I do

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.720 
cool black and so I did it and I do
think<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.799> looks<00:03:28.920> really<00:03:29.100> cool<00:03:29.250> because<00:03:29.400> now

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
think it looks really cool because now

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.370 
think it looks really cool because now
it's<00:03:29.850> just<00:03:29.970> sort<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.120> strictly<00:03:31.049> orange<00:03:31.320> or

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
it's just sort of strictly orange or

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.220 
it's just sort of strictly orange or
black<00:03:31.500> bean<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:32.070> think<00:03:32.910> that's<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.209> nice<00:03:33.390> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
black bean I think that's really nice so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.949 
black bean I think that's really nice so
the<00:03:34.709> brown<00:03:34.860> one<00:03:35.010> there's<00:03:35.190> three<00:03:36.000> inches<00:03:36.239> it's

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the brown one there's three inches it's

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.690 
the brown one there's three inches it's
made<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.860> basically<00:03:38.130> stock<00:03:38.370> dirt<00:03:38.549> so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
made for just basically stock dirt so

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.060 
made for just basically stock dirt so
you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.880> also<00:03:38.970> fire<00:03:39.209> stuff<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:39.630> but

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
you can also fire stuff in this but

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.539 
you can also fire stuff in this but
mostly<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.430> stock<00:03:41.640> there<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:43.549> back

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
mostly just for stock there so back

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.039 
mostly just for stock there so back
there<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:45.090> there<00:03:45.209> too<00:03:46.760> yeah<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:48.239> for<00:03:48.780> what<00:03:48.959> it

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
there in there too yeah it's for what it

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.810 
there in there too yeah it's for what it
is<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.320> actually<00:03:49.560> works<00:03:49.709> quite<00:03:50.610> well

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
is it actually works quite well

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.390 
is it actually works quite well
it<00:03:51.390> fires<00:03:51.630> around<00:03:51.980> yeah<00:03:52.980> somewhere<00:03:53.310> around

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
it fires around yeah somewhere around

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.069 
it fires around yeah somewhere around
the<00:03:53.549> 45<00:03:53.970> feet<00:03:54.150> flat<00:03:54.420> which<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.660> pretty

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
the 45 feet flat which is pretty

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.560 
the 45 feet flat which is pretty
impressive<00:03:55.230> for<00:03:55.470> Jules<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.519> don't<00:03:57.390> know<00:03:57.450> how

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
impressive for Jules I don't know how

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.660 
impressive for Jules I don't know how
much<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.959> actual<00:03:58.470> air<00:03:58.799> flow<00:03:59.040> helps<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.519> terms

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
much the actual air flow helps in terms

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.880 
much the actual air flow helps in terms
of<00:03:59.850> redirecting<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.959> needs<00:04:01.110> more<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.829> a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
of redirecting it it needs more in a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.590 
of redirecting it it needs more in a
forward<00:04:02.220> direction<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.730> I'm<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:03.030> maybe<00:04:03.390> that

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
forward direction but I'm not maybe that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.900 
forward direction but I'm not maybe that
might<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:03.959> something<00:04:04.200> new<00:04:04.290> with<00:04:04.410> white<00:04:04.910> fire

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
might have something new with white fire

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.710 
might have something new with white fire
so<00:04:06.209> well<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.810> yep<00:04:07.799> pretty<00:04:08.280> simple<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:11.579> was

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
so well so yep pretty simple it was

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.979 
so well so yep pretty simple it was
show<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.970> not<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.030> blaster<00:04:16.299> actually<00:04:16.810> it's

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
show is not a blaster actually it's

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.039 
show is not a blaster actually it's
actually<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.380> sort<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.630> loading<00:04:19.630> mechanism

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
actually a sort of a loading mechanism

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.460 
actually a sort of a loading mechanism
or<00:04:20.290> what<00:04:20.860> what<00:04:21.700> you'd<00:04:21.850> use<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.150> help<00:04:22.510> load<00:04:23.440> a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
or what what you'd use to help load a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.460 
or what what you'd use to help load a
hopper<00:04:23.680> or<00:04:23.980> an<00:04:24.070> RFC<00:04:24.280> B<00:04:25.200> basically<00:04:26.200> what<00:04:26.380> I've

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
hopper or an RFC B basically what I've

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.110 
hopper or an RFC B basically what I've
done<00:04:26.620> here<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:26.980> I've<00:04:27.160> put<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> brass<00:04:27.730> breach

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
done here is I've put on a brass breach

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.170 
done here is I've put on a brass breach
on<00:04:28.450> top<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.200> my<00:04:29.770> clip<00:04:30.040> here<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.610> how<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.150> works

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
on top of my clip here so how it works

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.530 
on top of my clip here so how it works
is<00:04:32.430> if<00:04:33.430> you're<00:04:33.610> using<00:04:33.640> this<00:04:33.940> in<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.150> hopper<00:04:34.270> or

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
is if you're using this in a hopper or

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.780 
is if you're using this in a hopper or
an<00:04:34.630> obviously<00:04:34.870> B<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.280> open<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.640> up

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
an obviously B you can open this up

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.210 
an obviously B you can open this up
right<00:04:36.940> here<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.770> can<00:04:38.860> see<00:04:39.040> there's<00:04:39.160> a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
right here and you can see there's a

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.770 
right here and you can see there's a
little<00:04:39.310> slot<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.610> there<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.480> can<00:04:40.600> toss

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
little slot in there and you can toss

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.680 
little slot in there and you can toss
starts<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.200> there<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.950> feed<00:04:42.370> darts<00:04:42.700> in<00:04:42.880> as

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
starts in there and you feed darts in as

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.900 
starts in there and you feed darts in as
much<00:04:43.870> as<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.050> want<00:04:44.320> until<00:04:44.530> it's<00:04:44.890> quote<00:04:45.130> or<00:04:45.370> so

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
much as you want until it's quote or so

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.060 
much as you want until it's quote or so
it's<00:04:46.060> bolt<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.510> then<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.810> close<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.680> up<00:04:47.920> and

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
it's bolt and then you close it up and

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.670 
it's bolt and then you close it up and
now<00:04:48.610> it's<00:04:48.760> ready<00:04:48.880> goes<00:04:49.150> it's<00:04:49.600> sealed<00:04:50.170> again<00:04:50.380> so

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
now it's ready goes it's sealed again so

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.510 
now it's ready goes it's sealed again so
what<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:50.950> used<00:04:51.190> here<00:04:51.310> was<00:04:51.580> obviously<00:04:52.360> brass<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
what I used here was obviously brass the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.960 
what I used here was obviously brass the
brass<00:04:54.940> underneath<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:56.760> nineteen<00:04:57.760> thirty

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
brass underneath is nineteen thirty

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.570 
brass underneath is nineteen thirty
Seconds<00:04:58.390> brass<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:59.320> actually<00:04:59.740> it's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
Seconds brass and that actually it's

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.300 
Seconds brass and that actually it's
very<00:05:01.000> very<00:05:01.330> tightly<00:05:01.600> inside<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.170> clear<00:05:03.070> PVC

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
very very tightly inside of clear PVC

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.120 
very very tightly inside of clear PVC
which<00:05:03.940> has<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> slightly<00:05:05.200> smaller<00:05:05.470> diameter

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
which has a slightly smaller diameter

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.000 
which has a slightly smaller diameter
than<00:05:06.160> regular<00:05:06.400> half-inch<00:05:07.030> PVC<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.800> was<00:05:08.919> able

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
than regular half-inch PVC so I was able

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.320 
than regular half-inch PVC so I was able
to<00:05:09.130> jam<00:05:09.280> that<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.460> there<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:09.730> super<00:05:10.180> glued

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
to jam that in there just super glued

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.580 
to jam that in there just super glued
that<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.600> there<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.840> sits<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.260> there<00:05:11.350> nice<00:05:11.560> and

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
that in there it sits in there nice and

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.440 
that in there it sits in there nice and
snug<00:05:11.860> so<00:05:12.040> that's<00:05:12.430> not<00:05:12.550> going<00:05:12.730> anywhere<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.120> it

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
snug so that's not going anywhere and it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.130 
snug so that's not going anywhere and it
seals<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.290> fine<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.910> then<00:05:16.419> over<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.840> it's

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
seals just fine and then over that it's

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.020 
seals just fine and then over that it's
5/8<00:05:17.919> sprouts<00:05:18.250> which<00:05:18.460> also<00:05:18.610> has<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.000> added

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
5/8 sprouts which also has the added

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.409 
5/8 sprouts which also has the added
benefit<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.870> being<00:05:20.230> able<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.730> fit<00:05:21.730> with<00:05:21.850> C<00:05:22.000> PVC

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
benefit of being able to fit with C PVC

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.450 
benefit of being able to fit with C PVC
coupling<00:05:22.630> since<00:05:23.080> CPVC<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.130> same<00:05:24.280> outer

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
coupling since CPVC is the same outer

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000 
coupling since CPVC is the same outer
diameter<00:05:24.820> of<00:05:24.880> 5/8<00:05:25.270> grass<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.740> can<00:05:26.860> see<00:05:26.980> I

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
diameter of 5/8 grass so you can see I

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.890 
diameter of 5/8 grass so you can see I
stuck<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.340> tee<00:05:28.120> on<00:05:28.270> there<00:05:28.419> just<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.750> make<00:05:28.810> it

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
stuck a tee on there just to make it

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.320 
stuck a tee on there just to make it
easier<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.350> grip<00:05:30.160> this<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.580> can<00:05:30.729> like<00:05:30.880> twist<00:05:31.180> it

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
easier to grip this I can like twist it

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.860 
easier to grip this I can like twist it
on<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.750> off<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.850> then<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.600> finally

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
on and off like that and then I finally

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.480 
on and off like that and then I finally
I<00:05:34.990> just<00:05:35.260> put<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.410> little<00:05:35.530> bit<00:05:35.620> of<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:36.370> is

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
I just put a little bit of this is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
I just put a little bit of this is
actually<00:05:36.760> like<00:05:37.150> plastic<00:05:37.630> cord<00:05:37.930> on<00:05:38.080> here<00:05:38.110> so

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
actually like plastic cord on here so

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.070 
actually like plastic cord on here so
that<00:05:38.560> way<00:05:38.710> it<00:05:39.120> stops<00:05:40.120> me<00:05:40.390> from<00:05:40.419> pulling<00:05:40.990> this

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
that way it stops me from pulling this

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.990 
that way it stops me from pulling this
all<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.410> way<00:05:41.500> off<00:05:41.680> so<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.370> can<00:05:42.400> just<00:05:42.880> open

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
all the way off so it can just open

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.090 
all the way off so it can just open
enough<00:05:43.630> for<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.840> breech<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.229> open<00:05:44.919> up<00:05:45.010> in

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
enough for the breech to open up in

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.990 
enough for the breech to open up in
there<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:47.160> yeah<00:05:48.160> actually<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.820> think

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
there so yeah actually I think

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.370 
there so yeah actually I think
personally<00:05:49.360> looks<00:05:49.510> really<00:05:49.720> cool<00:05:49.900> too<00:05:50.110> once

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
personally looks really cool too once

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.300 
personally looks really cool too once
you<00:05:50.440> throw<00:05:50.620> them<00:05:50.740> onto<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.950> hopper<00:05:51.430> here<00:05:53.310> so

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
you throw them onto a hopper here so

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.130 
you throw them onto a hopper here so
yeah<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.000> can<00:05:55.210> just<00:05:55.270> type<00:05:55.510> your<00:05:55.540> hopper<00:05:55.840> on

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
yeah you can just type your hopper on

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.610 
yeah you can just type your hopper on
like<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.580> then<00:05:58.030> stick<00:05:58.390> it<00:05:58.419> on<00:05:58.620> and

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
like that and then stick it on and

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.000 
like that and then stick it on and
you'll<00:06:00.250> blast<00:06:00.550> me<00:06:00.820> I<00:06:01.030> can<00:06:01.270> take<00:06:01.450> a

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010

people I'm not gonna fill it all the way
for<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:18.960> but<00:06:19.220> get<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.340> idea<00:06:20.550> of<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.700> the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
for you but get the idea of the the

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.000 
for you but get the idea of the the
steps<00:06:21.360> five<00:06:22.140> you<00:06:22.380> know<00:06:22.470> Queenie<00:06:22.770> through

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
steps five you know Queenie through

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.530 
steps five you know Queenie through
cleanly<00:06:23.340> through<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.640> brass<00:06:23.820> whatever<00:06:24.180> and

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
cleanly through the brass whatever and

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.970 
cleanly through the brass whatever and
you<00:06:24.630> can<00:06:24.720> close<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:24.930> up<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:25.350> then<00:06:27.680> it<00:06:28.680> works<00:06:28.830> so

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
you can close it up and then it works so

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.020 
you can close it up and then it works so
yeah<00:06:31.980> some<00:06:32.160> of<00:06:32.220> you<00:06:32.280> might<00:06:32.700> have<00:06:32.730> noticed<00:06:33.000> that

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
yeah some of you might have noticed that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.740 
yeah some of you might have noticed that
I<00:06:33.660> do<00:06:33.870> have<00:06:34.140> Stefan's<00:06:34.500> now<00:06:35.270> before<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.300> pretty

I do have Stefan's now before I pretty

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.880 
I do have Stefan's now before I pretty
much<00:06:36.810> lose<00:06:37.020> mainly<00:06:37.290> streamlines<00:06:37.710> that's

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
much lose mainly streamlines that's

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.380
