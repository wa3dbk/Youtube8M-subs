00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
a crowd slow motion here was a must for

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440

Medusa<00:02:29.560> turning<00:02:30.190> everyone<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.700> stone<00:02:30.970> seemed

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
Medusa turning everyone to stone seemed

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.210 
Medusa turning everyone to stone seemed
pretty<00:02:32.290> conclusive

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
pretty conclusive

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000

her<00:02:36.100> behind<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.730> enough<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> trick<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
her behind is enough to do the trick and
