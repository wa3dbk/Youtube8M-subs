00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this I've had it for about when it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.899

I've<00:01:47.970> heard<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.330> our<00:01:48.480> 10<00:01:48.720> days<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.290> had

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
I've heard from our 10 days so I've had

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.560 
I've heard from our 10 days so I've had
a<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.800> good<00:01:49.920> usage<00:01:50.550> of<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.240> work<00:01:51.420> out

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
a pretty good usage of it to work out

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.730 
a pretty good usage of it to work out
because<00:01:51.690> normally<00:01:52.080> after<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.410> week<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
because normally after about a week I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.530 
because normally after about a week I
can<00:01:52.890> realize<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.520> something's<00:01:53.850> good<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.360> not

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
can realize if something's good or not

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
can realize if something's good or not
you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.470> skin's<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.100> for

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you know when your skin's all right for

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
you know when your skin's all right for
a<00:01:56.370> few<00:01:56.550> days<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> breaks<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
a few days and then it breaks out or it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.110 
a few days and then it breaks out or it
just<00:01:58.770> decides<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.670> doesn't<00:01:59.910> like<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
just decides it just doesn't like the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.630 
just decides it just doesn't like the
foundation<00:02:00.660> my<00:02:01.410> skin<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.740> fine<00:02:01.980> with<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
foundation my skin is fine with this and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
foundation my skin is fine with this and
yours<00:02:02.970> might<00:02:03.120> not<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> probably<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.080> could

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
yours might not be it probably I could

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
yours might not be it probably I could
imagine<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.680> breaking<00:02:04.830> people<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.220> because

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
imagine it breaking people out because

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.480 
imagine it breaking people out because
it's<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:07.110> sticks<00:02:07.470> how<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
it's so it sticks how well you have to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.630 
it's so it sticks how well you have to
you<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.270> wash<00:02:09.780> off<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.020> face<00:02:10.320> I

higher<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> coverage<00:02:34.710> or<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.460> use<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
higher a coverage or you can just use a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.910 
higher a coverage or you can just use a
foundation<00:02:35.910> brush<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:37.080> woman<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.770> me

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
just a normal foundation brush and this

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.320 
just a normal foundation brush and this
gives<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.070> kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.430> thinner<00:02:41.700> application

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
gives it kind of a thinner application

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.520 
gives it kind of a thinner application
and<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.110> Pat<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> down

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
and you have to kind of Pat it down

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.920 
and you have to kind of Pat it down
otherwise<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> goes<00:02:44.100> into<00:02:44.310> strokes<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.690> do

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
otherwise it goes into strokes but I do

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.040 
otherwise it goes into strokes but I do
prefer<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.920> brush<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:48.480> you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
prefer this brush just because you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.690 
prefer this brush just because you
honestly<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.620> next<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.920> nothing<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.550> swear

honestly need next to nothing I swear

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
honestly need next to nothing I swear
this<00:02:50.940> would<00:02:51.150> last<00:02:51.300> months<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.080> months<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
this would last months and months and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.460 
this would last months and months and
months<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.310> use<00:02:53.610> i'd<00:02:54.570> say<00:02:54.900> like

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
months because you just use i'd say like

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.490 
months because you just use i'd say like
the<00:02:56.250> amount<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.480> pea-sized<00:02:58.050> amounts

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the amount of like to pea-sized amounts

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.080 
the amount of like to pea-sized amounts
and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:59.040> done<00:02:59.130> your<00:02:59.310> whole<00:02:59.490> face<00:02:59.700> like

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and then it's done your whole face like

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.470 
and then it's done your whole face like
really<00:03:00.360> high<00:03:00.450> coverage<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.940> they're<00:03:02.940> also<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
really high coverage so they're also a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.030 
really high coverage so they're also a
massive<00:03:03.900> bonus<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.830> can't

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
massive bonus of this is that you can't

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920 
massive bonus of this is that you can't
even<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.600> put<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.810> on

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
even see that it's on I can put it on

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.380 
even see that it's on I can put it on
and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.260> looks<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.040> skin<00:03:08.400> doesn't<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and it looks just like skin doesn't you

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.910 
and it looks just like skin doesn't you
just<00:03:09.600> can't<00:03:09.810> tell<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.350> not<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.770> grits

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
just can't tell it's not like it grits

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
just can't tell it's not like it grits
or<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.190> hairs<00:03:11.489> or<00:03:12.080> makes<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.200> look<00:03:13.290> like

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
or to the hairs or makes it look like

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960
