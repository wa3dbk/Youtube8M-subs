00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.000
 the two types of fundamentally exist 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.010
 sow seeds by hand 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
 generally applied surfaces of 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.599
 small size based on 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.119
 broadcaster distribution and sowing a 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.279
 machine with distribution broadcaster or 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.730
 file for larger sizes 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.680
 sowing by hand does not guarantee 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.900
 calibrated and uniform distributions for 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.600
 optimize this method we recommend 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.970
 operate in the absence of wind and divide 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.440
 the total dose disseminates in four 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.480
 equal parts 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.790
 each of which will be distributed to 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.790
 cross on the sowing surface 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.700
 doses vary according to type e 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.950
 to the desired seed species go 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.530
 anyway remembered that sowing too much 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 rada lengthens the formation time of the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 cotico and favors the establishment of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.150
 weeds a sowing too thick from 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.070
 part of it generates several drawbacks 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.930
 the essences with fast germination 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.640
 occupy the space of those a 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.860
 slow germination 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 therefore we will have an uneven lawn 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.810
 in addition, too much density keeps it high 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.770
 the humidity level favoring 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 the onset of diseases 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.150
 for sowing broadcaster with machines 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.580
 the distributor will proceed to taranto 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.310
 so as to spread half sena in the sense 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 longitudinal and half in the sense 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 transverse machines for their part 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.450
 can be of two types with 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.610
 drop or spin distribution a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.130
 further sowing technique and that 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.230
 file in this case the machine must 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.530
 be calibrated for non-spacing 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.420
 over 2 centimeters and a half with 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.180
 these machines are a good cover 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.670
 of the seed and is generally sufficient 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.470
 make only one pass 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.060
 we must also bear in mind that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.370
 when the seeds chosen are 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.160
 particularly small is a good rule 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.890
 add inert materials such as 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.580
 sand to improve distribution 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.580
 on the ground 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.819
 at the end of the sowing we will proceed to 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.590
 a small land cover that 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.870
 can be performed by hand with a 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.879
 rake for small surfaces 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.150
 while for wider extensions yes 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.220
 will use a very light harrow in 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.560
 alternatively you can use a top 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.419
 dressing that distributes on 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.919
 surface a light layer of 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.919
 fine material like sand 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.420
 in the presence of very light soil 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.000
 and dry it is good to make a light one 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.310
 rolling which will aim to pull over 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.620
 the soil to the seed and favor the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.460
 rising dampness that contributes 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.260
 to faster and more uniform attitudes 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.510
 the sowing period is one of the factors 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.210
 that determine the success of a 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.460
 grassy sprouting occurs with 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.830
 a sufficiently humid climate and with 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.120
 temperatures between 15 and 20 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.770
 degrees 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
 in italy these conditions yes 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.350
 occur in September periods 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.600
 October and March April sowing 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.150
 autumn in any case is to be preferred 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.950
 since the grasses are able to 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.950
 grow and develop faster 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.639
 if at any point the conditions of the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.259
 turf that they swear you can also 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.259
 proceed with sowing 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.690
 after shaving the lawn, the has passed 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.390
 strapping tool to remove felt e 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.120
 moss is distributed a mind axis 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.050
 of the regeneration type to be covered then 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.050
 with a little soil 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.190
 finally the roller is passed by irrigating 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.270
 regularly the new herb germinates in 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.850
 within a few days 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.850
 giving the lawn a compact appearance
