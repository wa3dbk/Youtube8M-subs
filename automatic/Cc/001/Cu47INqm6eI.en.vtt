 make a boxing of the new camera 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.440

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.750
 a little the content that has the 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.759
 What is new this new 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 camera this new model as you see the 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.310
 The camera's packaging is the classic 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.200
 the cameras go pro as always brings a 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.470
 plastic housing that is the one 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.360
 we can see here and a small sheath of 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.969
 cardboard that is the one that teaches us a 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.500
 little bit the content of the camera and 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.340
 some of the characteristics of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 processor and type of video that we can 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.530
 record with her 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.739
 the novelties really appear 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 appear here as soon as you open the camera 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.949
 the first change we noticed with 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.559
 with respect to the previous model is the form 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.400
 where the wifi command is set to 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.400
 packing before came with a wire 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.660
 that fixed the remote control to this 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.730
 part of here down right now comes 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.040
 with a plastic support bracket 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.920
 plastic we can remove it by pressing the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.970
 two sideburns that he presents here below 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.909
 this is and we can see it see here the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.590
 wifi command is identical to the one we came 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.750
 watching so far in accordance with the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.740
 same functions the same size is 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 practically identical 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.439
 what does change is the camera of agreement 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.810
 the camera is the great novelty of this 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.000
 model the changes that you have introduced 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 pro and the improvements that you have added 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 As you can see I do not know if you can appreciate 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.950
 really in hero 3 plus model is a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.789
 little bit smaller than the model 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.789
 previous 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.179
 the manufacturer proposes a reduction 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.630
 in the size of 20% what also has not 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.939
 depleted its battery capacity that without 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.560
 However, it has improved by 30% according to the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.259
 the the manufacturer 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.989
 in addition to improving the speed of the wifi 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.840
 of the wifi antenna and incorporate the new 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.489
 superview system that makes the camera 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.099
 be able to record more surface of 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.650
 image both in video and in photo and 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.769
 plus some improvements in the modes of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.079
 video that will allow us to record 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.329
 faster at a resolution is a 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.650
 little higher inside what is the 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.870
 camera 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 We also see that the closure has changed 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.049
 of the submersible housing is a little bit 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.909
 different from what we had seen until 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.299
 Now that I had a superior eyelash 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.159
 that blocked the closure right now that 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.519
 tab has disappeared and presents the 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.959
 close a little bit more simple 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.000
 we have the housing the housing 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 It has obviously changed its size to 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.120
 adjust to the new size of the I do pro 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.549
 of the camera and aesthetically if not 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.440
 we do much of the size if not 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.750
 we have a way to really compare it 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.750
 the camera is practically identical 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.730
 keeps the battery compartment 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.040
 maintains 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.140
 the mini usb hdmi connections and the slot 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.760
 for the micro sd card 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.420
 this is identical to the models 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.420
 previous to the hero 3 model 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.939
 and the camera as I said is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.829
 aesthetically identical with many 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.409
 changes inside as detailed 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.120
 just now within the 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.860
 Accessories that the good camera incorporates 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.019
 this is the model black edition is the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.810
 highest in the range the black edition 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.340
 hero 3 plus 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.720
 Bring us three stickers like so far 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 before came three separate stickers 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.720
 now it seems that the brand has 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.110
 implemented a single sheet of stickers 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.349
 and the warranty documentation and manual 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.980
 of instructions that is the usual of 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.980
 these cameras 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.150
 we'll see 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.130
 the manual 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.200
 and instructions 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.440
 inside the accompanying accessories 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.050
 the model as I tell you this is the model 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.720
 simple is not the southern version 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.490
 neither the nor the author version therefore 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.880
 the accessories are the classics 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.130
 It comes with the support for 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.050
 vertical surfaces that will allow 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.540
 swing the camera a little bit a little 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.010
 best 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.920
 These are accessories that we can also 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.840
 buy separately the pivot of three 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.770
 classic positions that we can also 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.770
 purchase separately 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.289
 two adhesives for flat surface and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.349
 curved surface 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.569
 and an anti vibrator that will help reduce 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.449
 the vibrations of the camera recording 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.619
 recording video when it is fixed to a 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.619
 support that has a lot of vibration 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.050
 the back cover of the housing is that the 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.909
 stink of agreement is the one that has the two 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.189
 slots evidently with this lid the 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:25.550
 camera is not submersible but yes we 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:28.710
 it helps a little to cool the camera and 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.840
 that does not reach very high temperatures 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.120
 we also have the ring to fix to 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.530
 I control guys and to fix it there do it myself 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.589
 I'm going to see it and be able to use it 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.389
 little bit more comfortable 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:46.559
 obviously the battery as I said 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.089
 This camera according to the manufacturer saves 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.790
 quite energy and has a performance 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:55.600
 30% higher 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:58.810
 and the two cables load the two cables 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.090
 which are the wifi charging cable 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.680

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.110
