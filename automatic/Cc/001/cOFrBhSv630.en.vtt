00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 In today's fashion show, it's all about 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.850
 to him and ultimate is or even in the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.130
 colloquialisms called the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:19.560
 fist god the every block in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 minecraft kitty yes the fist of god like 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.439
 she is young called saved 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.170
 actually a motto very much 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.400
 long exists and actually too 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.390
 should be relatively known but still 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.699
 I want the people just once 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.699
 because you just have a look 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 for example, the earth offers and we 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 also get loose from the creative 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.360
 modus put it this way, we briefly in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 creative mode with men's teams like that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 savannah blog so but I destroy in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 I say 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.000
 that's not what I mean with them , but 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:03.480
 yes the blocks against broken and here can 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 I as well the creative mode everything 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.689
 break something 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.939
 only I dismantle it and do not destroy it 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.290
 Say, get the looks out that goes 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.280
 with wood when it is a climb 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.420
 except for example because it is as if 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 we the leaves all times from the hand 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.030
 Build for the leaves to get the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.350
 we still need a pair of scissors 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 but I can demonstrate it to you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 Even stone is guarded so stone too 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.960
 premiere broken very quickly 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 who is going to torch this now ? 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.100
 because a torch is so much 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.560
 bad thing in the recording to recognize 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 that's probably why it should work 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 I also take a few more torches 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.280
 that maybe he was a dollar all over 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.090
 Of course I would say so and yes here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.360
 is now coal too 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.540
 fact is saved and then we get 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.500
 not that doctors so lay kohleblock 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 let's say we get that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 So doctor house that coal piece so then 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 let's go further down yes why 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.360
 again earth 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 So we put a torch with her 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.700
 understand and you can see normal here 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.780
 I would think that would click 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.860
 Somehow something an indication 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.510
 I'm manipulating that in the creative 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 Mode is or so and also traveling is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.350
 actually broken with a blow like that 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 as normal further down 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.110
 Of course, too , with one 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.820
 blow broken 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.030
 So as I said actually everything is with 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.250
 a blow is broken so actually 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 a summer break weapon and you see 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.950
 also durability is infinite because that 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.710
 actually quite over powered the weapon 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 Everything with pretty cool thing to 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.640
 Example if you say redstone 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.990
 So here is actually with everyone now 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.810
 also possible with someone in any case 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.670
 if you have a breast maybe 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.110
 you wanted to break down earth but he did 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.400
 he would then have to keep then 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.690
 need not to make creative 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.520
 Can you fist God for it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.630
 This fist can be used and skirt too 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.010
 do not destroy 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 So what is not yes she can indeed 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.130
 leaves quickly to get hold no 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.690
 blocks out but medlock is with this 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.090
 do not break a fist 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.440
 yes, we can still do so much 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.510
 Hanging as we want this amount 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.900
 will not break with this fist 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.730
 and the salzunger mod is too 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.610
 actually quite simple download you 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.720
 the modder and the power itself 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.670
 download links as always in the video 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 description and then just take off 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.840
 all files in minecraft come in and yes 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.550
 if he did that then you have to 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.080
 only the metallic one of the enemy 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.220
 namely that prior minecraft you can 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.950
 But you also delete before that is one 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.390
 relatively no matter 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.910
 with the flashing files pull 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.800
 minecraft yes and then you have the yes 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.510
 mother installed and can also with 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.040
 the fist of god or the teenager is 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 you break everything 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.380
 down to was ok then I will tell 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.820
 what's real about this motto 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.350
 Motto you like the mod conception 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.880
 also always the volt and I say 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.380
 mistake for seeing and until 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.380
 next time people
