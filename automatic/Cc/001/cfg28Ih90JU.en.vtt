00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 little injury that took me away from 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.440
 land for a day at the level of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.150

 with the team 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 I'm waiting to play again because 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 I may have played since the beginning of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 season our team is unbeaten 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.849
 finally good very good start of the championship 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 same name is a bit difficult for them 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.920
 entry into the team I work very hard 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.559
 and then I'm here without pressure 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 particular to be able to integrate 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.950
 team 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.399
 she will not miss you any action 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 constantly at this time of the year in 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.190
 selection there was adrenaline that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 when someone has played 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 almost ten years at the international level 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 with with his little look 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.090
 especially dot them dowries 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 international to watch the team 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.640
 national I'm early on the other side 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.129
 will tell the TV the adrenaline and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.040
 the most the same thing except that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 it's the adrenaline you have you a 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.939
 tale of other people who love their country 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.540
 and who wish victory at each 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.130
 party will have to say of our qualities we will 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.460
 to say took out a particular feeling 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 because I was lucky enough to be able to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 wear this shirt I know what 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.189
 represents so I watch matches 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 with 1 when I tell you with a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 particular feeling but without any 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.250
 frustration nor any regret because at 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 a given moment bath for having lived 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 long have lived well without regret 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.409
 and then just wanted good luck 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 to people who come after small guard 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.890
 the flag of algeria 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.810
 always up and that's important 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 Algeria in Africa Cup of Nations 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.829
 we had to give up you're going to follow very 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 certainly very closely what you 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.070
 are in contact with your excuses the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.390
 clear thought selection with some 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.009
 players the contact has never been broken 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.619
 to appreciate already or with members 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.830
 also from the federation the contact has 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 never been 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.709
 it's something that's totally 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.629
 normal when we rubbed people 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.640
 for many years and in this 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.890
 africa cup of nations you 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 wait for it, it's true it's very 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.310
 different today 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 I'm waiting for what I'm looking forward to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 see the African cup meaning when I 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.879
 I can not wait to see what we 're going 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 do it all and it's precisely 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.370
 tomorrow we brake very good cut 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.410
 africa 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.480
 I am confident she 1st mathieu the axÃ© 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.180
 minutes become the togo is over 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.300
 the first phase it will reach the coast 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.989
 ivory foggia works with a very good 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.739
 Working coach since 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.420
 arrival is in continuity 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.310
 I see the speech that is the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.830
 adopting speech and a very speech 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.230
 positive and optimistic since Pippa 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.420
 bad of me the speech is the same it's 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.790
 to say that I laughed to go the most 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.739
 far possible for myself even despite the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.750
 draw in spite of the group 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.040
 the difficulty of the group is the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.129
 ranking the latest ranking six 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.019
 once we are 19th world and then it's 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.330
 still a very great honor so go 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.780
 have to defend it will be at the cut 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.790
 africa 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.799
 we have known a lot of quality players 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.890
 and it's very feasible so salary 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.980
 200 entries 500 today 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.300
 I take pleasure that days ben bella 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.550
 to practice playing then to be 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.310
 competitive to have fun 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.170
 because football is something 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.610
 which makes me say that this is true 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.070
 that they deliver us for years 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.200
 now it's clear that it's 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.110
 always a special feeling of 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.470
 see the rb6 there too I enjoy for 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.330
 really want a good sense 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.140
 fiftieth anniversary also to all our 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.510
 nation 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.370
 all our people are still at the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.230
 memory of all that we lost for 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.110
 allow us today to have a 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.820
 free country a flag to our colors 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.150
 if I am something really 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.980
 great and so here I was enjoying 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.200
 to say hello to everyone 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.840
 Algerian people and as I will do like 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.140
 you very attentive to what we see it's 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.760
 in africa that I can once because 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.919
 that even members of my family 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.890
 said he would like me saying it's true you 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.169
 come back late to the 6th to come back 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.640
 selected state demand and dinan ce 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.780
 so sometimes it's good to have the 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.160
 chance of being able to put an end to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.220
 some rumors like that and say 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.280
 than me since I left my 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.320
 I have never regretted my choice 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.120
 is 6th and think of a cost whether it's 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.070
 else to have never been either in 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.030
 contact with the coach all this 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.000
 I can tell you is that I them 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.270
 wish good luck 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.320
 continuity in their work and that 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.060
 is good results 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.270
 if it's the most important because 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.580
 everyone spends a moment and and 101 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.700
 and Algeria has remained that's not the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.890
 more important is that guarding one 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.440
 progression and continuity and hot 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.360
 finally other words the coach vahid has 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.310
 very well understood and your decision I 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.919
 the respect it was not questioned 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.140
 so everything we hear right and 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.960
 left all these rumors have no 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.370
 moment 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.550
 that's why it's good to have 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.139
 the opportunity to say it yourself as 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.970
 this radio what can we by 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.130
 screams are different choices 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.729
 but there no it was never question 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.620
 and what also was it so it's not no 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.660
 more a refusal is a given moment and 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.479
 we decide it's the end for me 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.870
 mounted I represented very long 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.090
 already 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.660
 so it's not turning your back on 100 t he 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.789
 it's just a given moment know how 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.120
 class 10 unexpectedly each time from 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.090
 see a vigilante who will say that it is 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.660
 rumors so it was really a departure 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.160
 wanted and definitive and that's fine in 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.650
 a certain moment to turn the page 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.080
 and when the players are in shape or 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.509
 who are there we do not necessarily talk about this 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.690
 who retired by 50 when 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.949
 they are in meandering that seemed 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.500
 underneath let's not be judged either 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.770
 of them finds it's this article or 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.409
 the master trumps jaw that most 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.500
 high priority is our country it's 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.900
 the interest of our country and our team 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.009
 after individualities as they 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.009
 they are secondary
