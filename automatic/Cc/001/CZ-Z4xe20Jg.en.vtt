00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.590

 theme of submissive and games of this 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.909
 style you may leave it for the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.229
 secondary channel as well so not 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.239

 that just to try nothing happens and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.160
 let's give a few good attacks 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 mainly that I'm going to do europe myself 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.420
 you beat and I have no gems and nothing to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.570
 accelerate troops and handsome we have in 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.950
 the attack we have 170 archers we have 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.019
 a wall breaks that was left over from the attack 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 previous I did not forget to remove it and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.410
 we have two swimmers 2 healers like 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.710
 you want to call him we're going to use them 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.990
 mainly for the heroes what for 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.300
 go a little 80 2 and we're going to look for a 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.650
 I hope I do not have any problems with the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.230
 connection that lately is giving me 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.360
 that of the drawer is not the connection 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.820
 What I have these days is terrible 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.320
 ominous not the following then we are going to 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.940
 look for a town hall that is 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.740
 seekers that ajuntament the new 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.950
 method is quite by the simple fact 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.330
 that I do not have a last feed that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.970
 that is, I do not have any troops with a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.860
 pk I do not have the new troop as a 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.870
 golem I do not have troops that are touch is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.610
 as a giant then the truth is that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.840
 We're going to have a little bad time but you're good 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.000
 to try to get even the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340
 victory did not forget anything else since these 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.110
 videos are possibly to entertain 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.850
 a little bit since the people who ask me 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.950
 informative videos for the truth is that 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.120
 only make an informative medium with 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.430
 a background attack because it does a little 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.220
 boring and I understand you guys then 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.720
 we have the archers at level 6 guys 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.280
 our carnal as it is ajuntament e 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.520
 9 the first one that comes out then I'm left with 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.520
 is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.780
 but we're going to look for a bit of 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.580
 departure that neither hurry and good 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.140
 Well , let's talk a little about the channel 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.599
 while the channel is going 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 pretty good I'm very happy with the 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.950
 performance people are accepting 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.870
 pretty well we are already almost 15 thousand 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.060
 subscribers let's go for the 15 thousand a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.200
 million visits in just one month and the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.790
 it's really awesome how it's going 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.950
 the rhythm I hope that the channel also of 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.239
 clash of clay from those plans 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.370
 minecraft and call of duty that goes to 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.110
 upload things because I also have the same 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.209
 the same reception because the truth is 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.579
 that I am very proud of you and already 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.810
 is what I say I only try to say in each 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.760
 video and well then let's make a 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 attack in this village that seems not to 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.239
 can be very very still let's go 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 try to get the town hall already 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.500
 OK, a few of us are waiting 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.750
 want let's try to fool around 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.690
 percent or plan of all the tropes 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.389
 to try to go arriving that here they go to 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.870
 kill so that the canyon does not reach me here 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.570
 I also come here either here 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.280

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.810
 buildings that are outside worth 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.450
 I always recommend that you open this is 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.400
 something quite obvious that we're going to 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.650
 try to get the maximum both by 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.300
