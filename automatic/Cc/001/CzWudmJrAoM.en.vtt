00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.960
 Hello! I am Steve Gonzlez. HP's Global Product Marketing Manager. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 Introducing HP's ProLiant DL360 Series Server here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.750
 In this coffee lecture course 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.739
 I will explain the new features of the DL360p Gen8 server. 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.669
 This is HP's 8th generation ProLiant server and we will continue 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.589
 Continue the fine tradition of reliable, easy disassembly and assembly in this series 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.580
 And easy to repair 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.519
 In this unit 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.330
 We are talking about new features. 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.340
 And improved features 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.920
 DL360p Gen8 leads the industry in performance 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 Also expressed in efficiency, 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.470
 And computing power, only 1U space. 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.790
 It is enterprise-class design, versatile, and adaptable to future changes. 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.590
 demand. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.200
 DL360p Gen8 is an ideal choice 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.129
 For storage requirements that focus on performance but have low storage requirements 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.620
 In a high-density rack. 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.070
 The design point is not to waste previous investment 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 And extend the life of the server with flexible functions 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.730
 What's new? 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.580
 With DL360p Gen8 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.250
 You now have more options to support 8 SFF or 4 LFF drives. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.710
 And still can install CD player 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.200
 We introduced Intel E5-2600 products this time. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.859
 Serial processor 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.200
 With improved performance, 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.760
 Computing power and memory channel 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.729
 This series of processors is divided into 2, 4, 6, and 8 cores. 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.150
 Speed ​​up to 3.3GHz 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.870
 HP's most advanced technological innovation 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.570
 It is with the processor. 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.220
 HP Exclusive Smart Socket Guide offers you 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.539
 A simpler installation and repair service 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:00.950
 Or upgrade. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.500
 Its own foolproof installation design protects you 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.549
 Server and original equipment. 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.400
 With our 8th generation server 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.889
 Because we switch to flat cable, it is easier to repair the interior 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.290
 And add management assistant board. 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.089
 This way, it provides a clearer, faster access. 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.139
 We have improved the thermal design and removed the old seventh-generation black baffle 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.269
 G7 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.439
 Allow internal components to be disassembled without any problems and deploy faster 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.949
 Configuration or upgrade. 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.829
 New Smart Memory allows the system to confirm HP memory specifications 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.789
 In order to comply with HP's highest 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.870
 Quality standard. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.639
 Since memory is optimized for HP ProLiant 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.439
 So it offers a new and enhanced memory function 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.080
 Gen8 now supports DDR3-1600MHz memory 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.139
 Increase memory bandwidth by 20% 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.229
 Gen8 support 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.659
 4GB, 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.040
 8GB, 16GB memory density 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.430
 We can also support 1600MHz DIMMS with maximum capacity 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.459
 128GB capacity. 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.519
 New range of Smart Storage controllers 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.829
 And disk drive 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.779
 Improved the smart storage system function. 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.779
 In addition to superior performance and greater capacity 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.959
 Also with a new icon 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.109
 Will improve the status of the drive and the health operation display. 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.519
 We listen to the opinions of our customers. 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.619
 Customer feedback allows us to make it easier and faster to operate IO access on our servers. 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.359
 Interface card module adopts new fixed mechanism 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.120
 Quick disassembly 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.669
 Replace the PCI card 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.629
 Just pull up the blue block 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.349
 Rotate 180 degrees to remove the riser 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.479
 This is another HP innovation: Enterprise Design 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.119
 HP revolutionizes rack server network design and introduces a new kind of flexibility 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.959
 Network technology 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.219
 The HP Flex LOM is similar to a PCI card. 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:10.379
 The location is the same as the network card of the seventh-generation motherboard. 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.199
 Can change to different network cards, so you can change the configuration 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.189
 Flexible installation of 1Gb, 10Gb 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.599
 Or other future specifications 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.789
 No need to occupy the PCI expansion slot at all 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.869
 HP's next-generation DL360 server also introduces a new quick release 

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.210
 Replace the hot swap backup fan 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.150
 This new design again improves heat dissipation and power threshold 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.139
 Make the server cooler, quieter, and more efficient. 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.389
 Our recent 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.819
 Common Slot Power Supplies, so energy efficiency 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.279
 Up to 94%, we use products from Intelligent Power Solutions 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.340
 Not only is it more energy efficient, it is also compatible with previous products. 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.669
 Finally, the new version of iLO, 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.069
 iLO Management Engine, Active Health Monitor, and management and deployment features 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.999
 These features have helped you 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.669
 Accelerate your deployment and troubleshooting tasks. What about the data? 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.940
 The newly designed DL360p Gen8 server has been improved 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.039
 Performance and computing power have improved compared to the previous generation. 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.280
 Memory is doubled compared to seventh-generation servers 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.169
 We introduce Smart Storage and new vehicles to increase storage capacity 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.419
 33% 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.069
 PCIe 3.0 increases IO performance by 100% 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.660
 The latest HP Smart Array performance enhancements for Gen8 servers 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.330
 Up to 200% 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.759
 HP's iLO Management Engine 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.240
 And Active Health Monitoring System 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.120
 We were able to diagnose the problem of operation problems quickly. 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.090
 Five times faster? 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.160
 Major innovation in design 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.269
 More reliability, ease of assembly and repair and maintenance 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.059
 Summarize the summary 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.090
 Top Intel processor, HP qualified memory 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.839
 RAS new features for enterprise servers 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.749
 And flexible options to adapt to future needs 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:13.999
 The bottom line is 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.910
 DL360p Gen8 can meet your many performances in 1U space 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.889
 Computing power and IO requirements. A new cloud server. 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:30.889
 Thank you for choosing to work with HP!
