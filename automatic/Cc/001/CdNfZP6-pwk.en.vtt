00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.039 
I think it looks not natural already but
that's<00:01:48.609> how<00:01:48.759> it<00:01:48.939> looks<00:01:49.149> like<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.600> mean<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.960> a

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.950 
fun idea though but yeah it looks like
that<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.340> actually<00:01:54.759> had<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.270> practice<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:55.840> couple

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
that I actually had to practice a couple

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.699 
that I actually had to practice a couple
of<00:01:56.319> times<00:01:56.819> before<00:01:57.819> I<00:01:58.149> did<00:01:58.509> this<00:01:58.630> video<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.350> i

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
of times before I did this video and i

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.469 
of times before I did this video and i
find<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.189> instructions<00:02:00.880> are<00:02:01.060> not<00:02:01.270> that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
find that the instructions are not that

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.870 
find that the instructions are not that
helpful<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.740> guys<00:02:02.799> can<00:02:03.219> see<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.670> is

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
helpful and as you guys can see this is

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.779 
helpful and as you guys can see this is
like<00:02:04.149> my<00:02:04.990> layers<00:02:05.259> are<00:02:05.530> already<00:02:06.009> falling<00:02:06.549> so

like my layers are already falling so

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.020 
like my layers are already falling so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
results always are the same except this

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.970 
results always are the same except this
one<00:02:24.879> it's<00:02:25.450> actually<00:02:25.660> falling<00:02:26.440> off<00:02:26.590> even<00:02:26.950> more

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

it gets heavy in the back and it doesn't
stay<00:02:39.220> put<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:40.239> you're<00:02:40.540> doing<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.049> lot<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
stay put and like you're doing a lot of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.800 
stay put and like you're doing a lot of
like<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:42.250> trying<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> tucking<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.540> and

like like trying to tucking it in and
stuff<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.799> doesn't

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
stuff like that and it just doesn't

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.009 
stuff like that and it just doesn't
really<00:02:45.160> work<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.790> also<00:02:46.239> if<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.690> layered

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
really work and also if you have layered

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.930 
really work and also if you have layered
here<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.680> might<00:02:47.859> not<00:02:48.040> work<00:02:48.100> too<00:02:48.489> because<00:02:48.790> like

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
here it might not work too because like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.759 
here it might not work too because like
the<00:02:49.090> layers<00:02:49.329> will<00:02:49.690> unravel<00:02:50.049> like<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.560> bangs

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
the layers will unravel like the bangs

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.940 
the layers will unravel like the bangs
over<00:02:51.190> here<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.630> unraveling<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.739> have

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
over here is unraveling and I just have

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.339 
over here is unraveling and I just have
I<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.340> did<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:55.030> Bob<00:02:55.359> like<00:02:55.750> five<00:02:56.019> minutes

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
I just did this Bob like five minutes

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.680 
I just did this Bob like five minutes
ago<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.040> already<00:02:57.340> falling<00:02:57.760> off<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.450> it's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
ago and it's already falling off so it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.900 
ago and it's already falling off so it's
definitely<00:02:59.139> not<00:02:59.470> something<00:02:59.829> that<00:03:00.609> I<00:03:00.819> would

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
definitely not something that I would

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.930 
definitely not something that I would
use<00:03:01.660> ever<00:03:02.049> again<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.829> my<00:03:02.859> humble<00:03:03.190> opinion<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
use ever again in my humble opinion it

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.580 
use ever again in my humble opinion it
just<00:03:04.150> doesn't<00:03:04.480> work<00:03:04.569> for<00:03:04.810> me<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.440> might

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
just doesn't work for me but it might

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.140 
just doesn't work for me but it might
work<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.010> if<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.489> medium<00:03:06.940> length

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
work for you if you have medium length

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.370 
rubber band to separate the two and you
can<00:03:32.950> make<00:03:33.099> your<00:03:33.250> own<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:34.630> overall<00:03:35.079> I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
can make your own actually but overall I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.170 
can make your own actually but overall I
think<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.370> just<00:03:36.730> doesn't<00:03:37.030> work<00:03:37.120> for

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
think that it just doesn't work for

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.539 
think that it just doesn't work for
really<00:03:37.690> long<00:03:37.810> hair<00:03:38.079> simply<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:38.919> when<00:03:39.459> you

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
really long hair simply because when you

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.400 
really long hair simply because when you
have<00:03:39.579> long<00:03:39.910> hair<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.419> gets<00:03:40.720> heavy<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.260> back

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
have long hair it gets heavy in the back

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.500 
have long hair it gets heavy in the back
and<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.739> doesn't<00:03:41.769> hold<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.549> fake<00:03:42.849> bob<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and it doesn't hold the fake bob and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.020 
and it doesn't hold the fake bob and
this<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.139> so<00:03:44.319> flimsy<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.730> doesn't

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
this is so flimsy and it just doesn't

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.129 
this is so flimsy and it just doesn't
hold<00:03:46.209> everything<00:03:46.569> you're<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.049> need
