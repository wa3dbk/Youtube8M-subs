00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:13.450
 I took the sunlight and went to the sun to make the earth 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:17.619
 Place and control the planet x Short. 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:23.800
 Cutting controls and adding layers 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:25.930
 Layer This time , Dacom Krab of Japan came out of the earth like this. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:32.860
 Give fingerprint Japanese sun 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:37.120
 Enjoy the sun that nine times out of Layer 2 Japanese folding This puts less 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:41.980
 I will not move the sun. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.899
 I want to go to Earth and choose Earth. Graphic symbol is me. 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:51.969
 Yeah , it 's a fizzy girl, so I do not think I should use it as a symbol. 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:57.159
 And I did not move the sun yesterday. 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.329
 I think it will be added to the local yuma . 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:05.890
 I'll add 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:10.590
 The story that I pursued the area is that it is just up to 4 10 times in Japan. 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.270
 This is because once you talking about, so do not move to bring the sun 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.840
 I just added frames . 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.000
 Maybe the earth is going to move 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:29.229
 Actually , I called fu fu that copy. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.770
 I gave you a copy of the center Select aa and press right mouse button to start motion 1 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:39.219
 Let's move it. Yeah. And do not move in the middle. 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.439
 At the end, I moved to the end, and then I moved the earth to press 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.960
 This move. 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.250
 But off-watering as the Earth's sun is moving very different attention 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.420
 I'll do it. 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.530
 I need a guide and I'll add 2g. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.640
 These guides are usually planets 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:08.470
 So I move my parents to circle ellipses. 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:12.010
 Circle circle with circle tool There is no plane to circle, 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.780
 I 'll do that. 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.500
 So I came to that, but how about this line? 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.500
 I do not have a starting mower to stand. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 So you have to start it semantically and make it. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.220
 The eraser tool used to paint the weapon paint was painted out of paint 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.820
 I stuffed it. 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.020
 'S under the court's clear I have a laser tool 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:47.480
 Then it cuts away the eraser teulrigi is suggested sometimes forced to make another prophet 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.750
 Off the kid that started my will determine the starting means. So I went to Earth 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.560
 This went down closer to the front 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.170
 Place it at the beginning and at the end 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.110
 At the end, here at the end . 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:10.090
 Yes, we can see the beginning and the end , 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 It feels like it's still going on. 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.750
 Move. 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.500
 But the sun is the Earth 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.390
 It 's like terrorism. I 'll go up to the top of the guide. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.489
 Top 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:30.690
 Then press enter and you'll be out of the sun jig 4 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:37.130
 I could feel like going back and I'll press Enter Contra 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.989
 Then , always from the front of the fetus to make the front, 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:46.790
 The fetus is always looking back 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.790
 You can make it look like the back road.
