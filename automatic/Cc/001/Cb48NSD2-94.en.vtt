00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.799
 a dish that I love is the steak 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 tartar 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.650
 yeah then I embarrass him 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.980
 especially when they and chopping at 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.840
 knife 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 I do not like to sequence the meat 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 hashed me I think that's saying if you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.690
 see it's take a piece of meat 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.740
 to play a role, whether or not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 the referee is the first woman of the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.250
 sector and we will carve a little 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 small cubes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.619
 half a centimeter in the audience 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 is eroding to mach 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.009
 what's important is to take out the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 meat just at the moment so it's more 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 we will be careful to work throw on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.989
 something very very cool it's 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 really dishes that we have to do 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 at the moment the best steak tartare of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.379
 world is prepared for mimicry and in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 Restaurant times what is it that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 we finish the second secret and the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.789
 steak tartare is the seasoning 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 we are going to put an egg yolk 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 to be seasoning and then I can 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.559
 correctly a beautiful base is that of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 the mustard 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.699
 according to his caper taste then one of the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.050
 four were big carp on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 can let go and I put a little bit of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 Espelette pepper for the hour 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.850
 Peppercorns 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.770
 meat all his fans if you want 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.250
 to raise to pepper and if you go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 you pep it's horrible ketchup 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 possibly what I like me 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.040
 it's tabasco and the sauce in the name 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 unpronounceable on the few drops 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 here the raw onion actually 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 indispensable in this recipe for 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.400
