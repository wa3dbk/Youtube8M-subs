Netflix<00:01:32.310> trials<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> manual

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
Netflix trials and it's like the manual

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.820 
Netflix trials and it's like the manual
i<00:01:38.020> guess<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.380> everything<00:01:38.710> else<00:01:39.090> whatever

it's<00:01:41.830> nelson<00:01:42.570> wires<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:49.140> AV<00:01:50.140> cable<00:01:51.720> or

composite<00:01:54.509> cables<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.880> think<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.570> power

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
composite cables and I think the power

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.570 
composite cables and I think the power
you<00:02:00.850> need<00:02:00.880> yeah<00:02:01.860> PlayStation<00:02:02.860> school<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.159> think

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
you need yeah PlayStation school I think

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.029 
you need yeah PlayStation school I think
because<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.179> doesn't<00:02:04.840> take<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.909> power<00:02:06.909> brick

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
because it doesn't take a power brick

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.140 
because it doesn't take a power brick
like<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.450> Xbox<00:02:10.450> does<00:02:11.459> here's<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.580> powerful

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
like the Xbox does here's a powerful

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.759 
like the Xbox does here's a powerful
this<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:15.459> controller<00:02:15.910> charger<00:02:16.569> okay<00:02:16.769> anyway

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the PlayStation 3 doesn't take a

the PlayStation 3 doesn't take a
gigantic<00:02:19.959> power<00:02:20.140> brake<00:02:20.500> might<00:02:21.250> be<00:02:21.900> stupid

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
