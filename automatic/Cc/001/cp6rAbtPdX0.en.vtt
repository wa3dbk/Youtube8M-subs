00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
thought you have while you're trying to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
thought you have while you're trying to
work<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> an<00:00:56.100> impediment<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
work the the more of an impediment it is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.959 
work the the more of an impediment it is
processes<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.640> basically<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.940> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
processes like this basically take that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
processes like this basically take that
right<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> equation<00:01:02.629> my<00:01:03.629> emphasis<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
right out of the equation my emphasis in

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
right out of the equation my emphasis in
this<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.970> exercises<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
this and a lot of the exercises in the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.340 
this and a lot of the exercises in the
book<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.890> enjoying<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> process<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
book is about enjoying the process the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.890 
book is about enjoying the process the
pleasure<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.000> 99%<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> process<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.900> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pleasure is 99% in the process this is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.580 
pleasure is 99% in the process this is
very<00:01:16.380> freeform<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.400> no<00:01:18.890> best<00:01:19.890> technique

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
very freeform there's no best technique

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.209 
very freeform there's no best technique
I<00:01:21.649> think<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:22.490> very<00:01:22.670> true<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:23.829> even<00:01:24.829> even<00:01:25.100> if

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
I think it's very true that even even if

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.550 
I think it's very true that even even if
we're<00:01:25.429> talking<00:01:25.549> about<00:01:25.899> realistic<00:01:26.899> painting

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
we're talking about realistic painting

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.899 
we're talking about realistic painting
so-called<00:01:28.960> expressing<00:01:29.960> its<00:01:30.679> value<00:01:31.579> or

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
so-called expressing its value or

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.980 
so-called expressing its value or
expressing<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.020> aesthetics<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:34.729> an<00:01:35.240> abstract

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
expressing the aesthetics is an abstract

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
expressing the aesthetics is an abstract
thing<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.679> words<00:01:36.920> don't<00:01:37.520> really<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:39.700> visual

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
thing and words don't really do visual

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:56.649 
thing and words don't really do visual
art<00:01:40.939> well<00:01:52.780> take<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> piece<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:54.200> paper<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:55.659> I'm

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
art well take a piece of paper and I'm

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.940 
art well take a piece of paper and I'm
going<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:56.869> make<00:01:57.020> an<00:01:57.170> instant<00:01:57.619> print<00:01:59.890> there's<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to make an instant print there's a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.850 
going to make an instant print there's a
lot<00:02:01.219> of<00:02:01.429> choices<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:02.959> make<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.590> take

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
lot of choices that you can make to take

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.639 
lot of choices that you can make to take
something<00:02:04.849> that<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.569> developed<00:02:06.140> almost<00:02:06.500> by

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
something that is developed almost by

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.270 
something that is developed almost by
pure<00:02:06.890> chance<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.619> taking<00:02:10.220> it

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
pure chance and then you know taking it

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.470 
pure chance and then you know taking it
further<00:02:10.690> discovery<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:11.959> it's<00:02:13.480> some

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
further discovery is that it's some

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.240 
further discovery is that it's some
really<00:02:14.900> interesting<00:02:15.140> things<00:02:15.590> are<00:02:15.769> happening

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
really interesting things are happening

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.930 
really interesting things are happening
this<00:02:17.150> might<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:18.290> inspiration<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:19.459> a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
this might be the inspiration for a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.500 
this might be the inspiration for a
painting<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.650> know<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.640> piece<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
painting you know or a piece that you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.840 
painting you know or a piece that you
might<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.959> draw<00:02:24.170> into<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.459> another

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
might want to draw into and and another

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.210 
might want to draw into and and another
thing<00:02:26.209> even<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.920> come<00:02:28.069> up<00:02:28.190> with

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
thing even with that you come up with

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.039 
thing even with that you come up with
compositions<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.630> can't<00:02:29.870> necessarily

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
compositions that you can't necessarily

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.680 
compositions that you can't necessarily
predict<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.459> there's<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> degree<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.180> control

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
predict but there's a degree of control

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.860 
predict but there's a degree of control
but<00:02:32.989> there's<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.290> degree<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:34.870> you're

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
but there's a degree to which you're

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.349 
but there's a degree to which you're
going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.319> surprised<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.910> curious<00:02:38.239> how

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
going to be surprised just curious how

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.360 
going to be surprised just curious how
does<00:02:38.510> how<00:02:38.870> does<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.200> feel<00:02:39.410> being<00:02:39.440> blindfolded

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
does how does it feel being blindfolded

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.709 
does how does it feel being blindfolded
you're<00:02:41.269> more<00:02:41.420> free<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:42.319> nobody
