 clearly demonstrated that even though 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.550

 abdominal excess in your abdominal area 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.610
 there are two types of fat the first type the 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.370
 that prevents your abdominals from being 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.680
 visible is called subcutaneous fat and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.420
 rests directly below the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.690
 skin and above the muscles 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.579
 abdominals the second type of fat that 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.040
 you have in your abdominal area is called 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.140
 visceral fat this rests in the part 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.060
 deeper abdomen below 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.909
 your muscles and surrounds your organs 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.250
 and visceral fat also plays a 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.409
 role in giving certain men that 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.200
 appearance of beer belly in the 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.299
 which your abdomen protrudes excessively 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.030
 and at the same time it feels hard when 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.610
 you press so much subcutaneous fat 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.130

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.710
 abdominal area are risk factors 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 for serious health however the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.640
 science has shown that fat 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.640
 excessive visceral is even more 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.890
 dangerous than subcutaneous fat both 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.950

 particularly dangerous partly 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.819
