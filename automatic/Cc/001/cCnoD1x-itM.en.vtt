00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to you metagame not passed 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420
 several months as an icefrog yet 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.250
 decided to please us with a new character 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.469
 dota and this is winter wyvern 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.400
 well or just a wyvern is a hero with 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.929
 main attribute 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 intelligence and four active 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 abilities but he is not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 too complicated to use and to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.369
 learn them to play correctly from you not 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
 take a lot of practice and in this 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 video I will try to tell you how 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 should apply wyvern in the game 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 well first let's talk about 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.750
 how does this character's skill work 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.489

 and still get a lot of different gifts is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 great mp3 player portable 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.500
 bluetooth speaker beatbox mini 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.239
 as well as a knife shaped credit card card 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 sharp link to their store you see 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.660
 now on your screens as well as you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 You can find it in the video description and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 The first skill is called arctic bird under 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 his action is our attack range 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 increases to 1000 a each shot 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.469
 slows down 40 percent on 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 maximum pumping besides everything 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.699
 others attack its target loses by six 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.799
 percent of current health per second 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.210
 so the arctic burn is great 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.340
 slowdown and also damage which 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 applied as a percentage and it makes it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.299
 equally effective weapon as against 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.860
 tanks with a bunch of hp and against thin 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.720
 curry and also the percentage component 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 this skill makes it effective 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 flesh to the deepest leith is not yet 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.540
 it's worth forgetting that while the arctic is working 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.640
 burn the range increases 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.650
 review and our hero gets the opportunity 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 fly over objects like trees 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.659
 or rocks that allows you to use this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 skill including for escape 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.470
 the second skill is faithful is called 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.380
 splinter blast it at the same time and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 good nuke with damage for 340 and not weak 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 slowdown feature of this skill 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 is that the chosen target is not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.060
 takes no damage slowing down but 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 it is received by all enemies who are 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.869
 within a radius of 500 from this target 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 so we need to always let in 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 interblast with rebound if we want for 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.540
 damage someone specific separately 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.619
 worth mentioning a small cooldown 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.210
 just 7 seconds 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.430
 thanks to this we can use 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.350
 blaster splinter for farm push or 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 for permanent harass opponents on 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.119
 lines our third skill is called Kaldan 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 breaks we freeze ourselves for 4 seconds 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 or ally on the spot at this time 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.879
 treatment starts 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.069
 allows you to recover about 25 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.599
 percent health 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.310
 also a useful bonus is that 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.769
 frozen target will be completely 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
 protected from any physical damage but 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.489
 but at this moment the frozen hero 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.349
 loses the ability to cast a skill or 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.090
 move this way in our 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.219
 the treatment will be excellent 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.670
 which will help us recover between 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.379
 tracks 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.060
 Well, and also qoldim breeze will help us 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.250
 defend against any attack 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.209
 Magera's serious cunt like phantom 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 or liftiller 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.739
 and finally ulta winter and faithful winter's 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.629
 curse is a curse that freezes 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.760
 target in place to 3 seconds with 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.889
 forcing all the nearby heroes and and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 attack with this spell we 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.519
 not only can we turn off the fight 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.349
 several heroes at once but quickly 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.449
 focus on some frail goal 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.859
 the ranks of the enemy can also winter's curse 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.079
 use as just weird 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.239
 escaping a lonely goal as well as 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.400
 many ults and winter's curse punches 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.139
 even immune to magic and now having learned 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.849
 about all the wyvern abilities let's 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.280
 let's highlight its main pros and cons 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.079
 the first and most serious plus is that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.120
 unlike many other casters 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.519
 skills you are faithful remain effective 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.139
 flesh to the deepest leith good 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.669
 gank potential due to strong 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.129
 deceleration makes it easy and quick 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.349
 deal with a solitary runaway goal 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.599
 which I do n't have a reliable escaping almost 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.939
 can not escape in the mass 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.799
 wyvern fights also have great aoes 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.500
 skills that can seriously affect 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.509
 to any of the minuses one of 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.220
 major league rightly is that 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.379
 in a one- on-one fight she almost did not 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.419
 can do anything with his cards or 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.609
 noticeable for damaging the enemy with your attacks 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.349
 also one of the noticeable flaws and 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.389
 true is that any sarah lance 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.829
 allows you to fully lock it and this 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.810
 really serious minus 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.639
 especially considering that bkb is not included 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.069
 essentials for this 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.109
 hero despite a good stock of lives 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.090
 and the treatment of wyvern is not high 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.069
 survival rate due to low muvspid 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.709
 her chance of escaping from the gang is not particularly 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.870
 high now it's time to talk about 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.790
 volume what role can play in the game 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.590
 this character can really well 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.449
 act as a support and 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
 assistant for their teammates so in 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.289
 the role of a mider where she is capable of dignified 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.359
 stand on the line and then your gangs 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:16.009
 seriously spoil the enemies life but for 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.030
 each of these roles we need 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.799
 different skillbuild 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.509
 support and right will be first 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.699
 focus on our third ability 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.660
 it will help our carey to stand on the line 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.640
 for this calder brace need for 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.710
 maksik seventh ligulu but the second 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.690
 the importance of the spell will be arctic burn 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.490
 which will serve as a great slowdown and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.300
 will allow together with our kerey do 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.040
 early keels 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.050
 first of all for miller 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.090
 focus on sprinter chapters because 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.010
 this is our main source of magical 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.020
 damage treatment in this case to us 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.850
 it will be enough to take one on the second 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.770
 you were well and our first ability we 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.570
 fully learn to the tenth Ligul 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.640
 now let's talk about how 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.720
 should use wyvern in different 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.760
 game situations 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.650
 the case when we want to come and zagat 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.870
 the enemy must approach the enemy from the side 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.970
 trees then activate arctic 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.650
 burn and flying right above the trees one 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.930
 time to hit the target to work 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.880
 slowing down and burning out health and then 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.710
 with a rebound from another creep or hero 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.660
 you need to run the splinter layer 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.700
 after that if you do this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.440
 have not yet killed the target then use the ulta in 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.050
 the quality of the camp so as not to give the enemy 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.120
 leave if you see enemies attacking 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.800
 you are locked in a corner then in this case the best 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.840
 output is to use arctic burn 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.700
 flying over the trees to hide from 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.510
 visual field and volume use scroll 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.460
 teleportation 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.620
 when a mass brawl starts 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.480
 Your task is to save your ulta to 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.640
 moment until one of the allies is not 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.440
 initiates a fight by hooking multiple targets 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.940
 your camp and after that you can 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.500
 activate winter's curse 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.420
 to get into it the maximum 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.130
 the number of heroes and of course 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.140
 cooldown do not forget to shower 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.880
 splinter blast to the center of the truck and more 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.770
 preferably once by 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.990
 arctic burn hit every target to 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.520
 hang a debuff on them if in the team 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.370
 the enemy has strong initiators 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.930
 like magnus tide or enigma then 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.060
 you should stay away from the center 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.960
 fights to activate immediately after 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.790
 their ults 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.250
 it is necessary to turn the turn 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.020
 fighting in their favor is now time 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.030
 say a few words about the items that 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.890
 will look good on wyvern 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.110
 if you play a support role then 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.660
 a good choice will be wards courier 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.850
 arcane boots for stoff &amp; magic wand 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.200
 since support is rarely a lot 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.480
 money plus on his conscience will be 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.760
 the constant purchase of wards that goal you need 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.740
 set the simplest bodies in front of you 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.600
 markedly increase our monopol and help 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.800
 us and our teammates keep mana on 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.390
 sufficient level 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.400
 force staff will serve for our 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.320
 escapes and to save their teammates 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.040
 because you can for example throw an ally 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.539
 Cold Embrace 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.850
 and push it away from the center 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.540
 fights well, magic wand is a cheap way 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.490
 stop hp and mana when 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.320
 during the battle if we talk about the role
