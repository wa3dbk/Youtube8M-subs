a<00:02:07.670> Germany's<00:02:08.119> first<00:02:08.330> time<00:02:08.660> trailing<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.410> guess

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
a Germany's first time trailing I guess

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.770

since<00:02:10.310> qualifications<00:02:11.060> even<00:02:11.450> before

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
since qualifications even before

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.680 
since qualifications even before
qualifications<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.909> second<00:02:14.300> time<00:02:14.450> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
qualifications but the second time that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.800 
qualifications but the second time that
Balotelli's<00:02:16.060> Balotelli<00:02:17.060> scored<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.629> was

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
Balotelli's Balotelli scored I was

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.850 
Balotelli's Balotelli scored I was
getting<00:02:18.080> really<00:02:18.260> really

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
getting really really

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.250 
getting really really
worried<00:02:19.360> because<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.900> didn't<00:02:21.110> seem<00:02:21.230> like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
worried because it didn't seem like

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.720 
worried because it didn't seem like
Germany<00:02:21.680> was<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> score<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
Germany was going to score like in the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.460 
Germany was going to score like in the
first<00:02:22.910> 10<00:02:23.210> minutes<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.720> first<00:02:23.900> 12<00:02:24.140> minutes<00:02:24.230> or

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
first 10 minutes the first 12 minutes or

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.770 
first 10 minutes the first 12 minutes or
so<00:02:24.850> Germany<00:02:25.850> was<00:02:25.940> taking<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.210> lot<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.360> chances

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
so Germany was taking a lot of chances

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.470 
so Germany was taking a lot of chances
on<00:02:26.990> goal<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:28.760> were<00:02:28.850> getting<00:02:28.970> blocked<00:02:29.270> by

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
on goal and they were getting blocked by

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.070 
on goal and they were getting blocked by
Buffon<00:02:29.900> or<00:02:30.380> even<00:02:30.740> by<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> Italian<00:02:31.370> defenders

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
Buffon or even by the Italian defenders

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.690 
Buffon or even by the Italian defenders
but<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.530> seemed<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:33.980> Germany<00:02:34.370> was<00:02:34.490> going<00:02:34.640> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
but it seemed like Germany was going to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.790 
but it seemed like Germany was going to
score<00:02:34.940> eventually<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:35.990> after<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> 12th

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
score eventually but after the 12th

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.620 
score eventually but after the 12th
minute<00:02:36.980> things<00:02:37.730> went<00:02:37.970> really<00:02:38.090> sour<00:02:38.420> for

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
minute things went really sour for

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.540 
minute things went really sour for
Germany<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.260> their<00:02:39.590> their<00:02:40.070> shots<00:02:40.370> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
Germany like their their shots and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.120 
Germany like their their shots and
target<00:02:40.820> started<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.540> lot<00:02:42.380> more<00:02:42.560> astray

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
target started going a lot more astray

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.580 
target started going a lot more astray
and<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:44.240> just<00:02:44.420> looked<00:02:44.690> less<00:02:44.990> convincing<00:02:45.470> that

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and it just looked less convincing that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.680 
and it just looked less convincing that
Germany<00:02:45.920> was<00:02:46.010> ever<00:02:46.220> going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.459> score<00:02:46.700> like

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
Germany was ever going to score like

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.750 
Germany was ever going to score like
possession<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.709> 5050<00:02:49.250> throughout<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> first

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
possession was 5050 throughout the first

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.690 
possession was 5050 throughout the first
half<00:02:49.910> 2nd<00:02:50.360> half<00:02:50.390> Germany<00:02:50.930> was<00:02:51.670> creating<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
half 2nd half Germany was creating a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.090 
half 2nd half Germany was creating a
little<00:02:52.850> bit<00:02:52.940> more<00:02:53.030> chances<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.100> maintaining

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
little bit more chances and maintaining

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.680 
little bit more chances and maintaining
more<00:02:55.220> possession<00:02:55.640> slightly<00:02:56.120> more<00:02:56.300> possession

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
more possession slightly more possession

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.440 
more possession slightly more possession
in<00:02:57.050> from<00:02:57.680> what<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.800> can<00:02:57.890> tell<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.300> seemed

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
in from what I can tell but it seemed

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.330 
in from what I can tell but it seemed
like<00:02:59.570> Italy<00:02:59.989> was<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> lot<00:03:00.470> more<00:03:00.620> threatening<00:03:00.980> in

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
like Italy was a lot more threatening in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.750 
like Italy was a lot more threatening in
front<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.850> German<00:03:02.570> keeper<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:04.520> didn't

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
front of the German keeper it didn't

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.510 
front of the German keeper it didn't
really<00:03:04.850> matter<00:03:05.060> how<00:03:05.420> many<00:03:05.540> times<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.520> Germany

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
really matter how many times I Germany

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.430 
really matter how many times I Germany
went<00:03:07.700> down<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.940> wings<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.570> deliver<00:03:08.959> crosses

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
went down the wings to deliver crosses

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.900 
went down the wings to deliver crosses
because<00:03:09.770> whenever<00:03:09.980> they<00:03:10.220> crossed<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.670> ball

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
because whenever they crossed the ball

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.850 
because whenever they crossed the ball
it<00:03:11.510> would<00:03:11.690> seem<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.380> was<00:03:12.470> always<00:03:12.770> an

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
it would seem like it was always an

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.130 
it would seem like it was always an
Italian<00:03:13.400> who<00:03:13.520> would<00:03:13.730> he<00:03:14.300> would<00:03:14.420> just<00:03:14.540> uh<00:03:14.720> you

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
was the same situation like like Germany

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.920

had this great run up until they met
Italy<00:03:24.320> Italy<00:03:24.590> would<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.130> stop<00:03:25.610> everything

the last few minutes of the game there

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.660 
the last few minutes of the game there
was<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> hand<00:03:33.650> ball<00:03:33.769> by<00:03:33.830> one<00:03:34.250> they<00:03:34.370> tellin

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
was a hand ball by one they tellin

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.600 
was a hand ball by one they tellin
defenders<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.680> bird<00:03:36.680> still<00:03:36.950> took<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
defenders and bird still took the the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.390 
defenders and bird still took the the
German<00:03:37.970> penalty<00:03:38.750> kick<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.080> he<00:03:39.200> scored<00:03:39.500> once

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
German penalty kick and he scored once

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.300 
German penalty kick and he scored once
Germany<00:03:40.880> had<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:41.660> goal<00:03:41.959> behind<00:03:42.950> them

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
Germany had that one goal behind them

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.910 
Germany had that one goal behind them
they<00:03:43.730> started<00:03:44.030> playing<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.299> lot<00:03:44.510> more<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.890> know

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
they started playing a lot more you know

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.610 
they started playing a lot more you know
I<00:03:46.310> guess<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.239> did<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> lot<00:03:47.840> more<00:03:48.019> urgency<00:03:48.410> behind

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
I guess it did a lot more urgency behind

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.979 
I guess it did a lot more urgency behind
him<00:03:49.010> behind<00:03:49.400> their<00:03:49.549> attacks<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.120> even<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
him behind their attacks and even the

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.630 
him behind their attacks and even the
German<00:03:51.260> keeper<00:03:51.500> was<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.890> up<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.130> attack<00:03:52.430> as

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
German keeper was going up to attack as

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.250 
German keeper was going up to attack as
well<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.209> was<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.420> entire<00:03:53.720> German<00:03:54.140> team

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
well so it was the entire German team

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.150 
well so it was the entire German team
coming<00:03:54.500> up<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.769> attack<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.700> Italian<00:03:56.769> but<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
coming up to attack the Italian but it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.009 
coming up to attack the Italian but it
was<00:03:58.280> good<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.549> see<00:03:58.610> Germany<00:03:59.150> like<00:03:59.390> trying<00:03:59.780> in

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
was good to see Germany like trying in

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.380 
was good to see Germany like trying in
the<00:04:00.049> last<00:04:00.350> like<00:04:00.590> four<00:04:00.799> minutes<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.310> my<00:04:02.150> they

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
the last like four minutes like my they

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.240 
the last like four minutes like my they
multiplied<00:04:02.989> their<00:04:03.200> strength<00:04:03.530> like<00:04:03.830> tenfold

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
multiplied their strength like tenfold

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.830 
multiplied their strength like tenfold
in<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.730> last<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:05.150> three<00:04:05.209> or<00:04:05.600> four<00:04:05.630> minutes

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
in the last like three or four minutes

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.660 
in the last like three or four minutes
and<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:07.010> looked<00:04:07.190> like<00:04:07.280> they<00:04:07.400> might<00:04:07.519> have

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
and it looked like they might have

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.670 
and it looked like they might have
scored<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.239> they<00:04:08.390> had<00:04:08.570> maybe<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.170> five<00:04:09.470> more

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
scored if they had maybe like five more

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.810 
scored if they had maybe like five more
minutes<00:04:10.060> maybe<00:04:11.060> 10<00:04:11.180> minutes<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:13.040> i<00:04:13.070> would<00:04:13.670> say

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
minutes maybe 10 minutes but i would say

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.819 
minutes maybe 10 minutes but i would say
throughout<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.360> game<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.840> Germany<00:04:15.709> was

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
throughout the game I Germany was

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.340 
throughout the game I Germany was
outplayed<00:04:16.190> by<00:04:16.609> Italy<00:04:17.600> what<00:04:17.720> they<00:04:17.870> just<00:04:18.079> played

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
outplayed by Italy what they just played

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.370 
outplayed by Italy what they just played
so<00:04:18.590> much<00:04:18.739> better<00:04:19.989> especially<00:04:20.989> compared<00:04:21.290> to

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
so much better especially compared to

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.840 
so much better especially compared to
their<00:04:21.500> game<00:04:21.620> against<00:04:21.859> England<00:04:22.220> i<00:04:22.490> think<00:04:22.669> i<00:04:22.729> get

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
their game against England i think i get

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.400 
their game against England i think i get
england<00:04:23.240> they<00:04:23.300> played<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.570> really<00:04:24.200> lousy

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
england they played like really lousy

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.409 
england they played like really lousy
against<00:04:25.190> england<00:04:25.550> they<00:04:25.970> still<00:04:26.150> managed<00:04:26.390> to

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
against england they still managed to

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.760 
against england they still managed to
win<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.780> but<00:04:27.140> in<00:04:27.260> this<00:04:27.380> game<00:04:27.440> against

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
win that but in this game against

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.890 
win that but in this game against
germany<00:04:28.160> italy<00:04:28.610> they<00:04:28.849> totally<00:04:29.419> stepped<00:04:29.690> up

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
germany italy they totally stepped up

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.660 
germany italy they totally stepped up
their<00:04:29.990> game<00:04:30.050> like<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.830> guess<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.280> said

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
their game like I guess I said

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.880 
their game like I guess I said
Germany<00:04:32.030> really<00:04:32.300> well<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.720> they<00:04:33.410> figured<00:04:33.740> out

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
Germany really well and they figured out

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.270 
Germany really well and they figured out
how<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:35.000> know<00:04:35.030> contain<00:04:35.480> Germany's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
offensive power something that nobody

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.920 
offensive power something that nobody

Germany and the final scoreline showed
that<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:01.010> fact<00:05:01.280> but<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.330> could<00:05:02.540> have<00:05:02.630> been<00:05:02.690> a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
that that fact but it could have been a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.270 
that that fact but it could have been a
lot<00:05:02.930> worse<00:05:02.990> though<00:05:03.410> like<00:05:03.680> Italy<00:05:04.010> could<00:05:04.160> have

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
lot worse though like Italy could have

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.990 
lot worse though like Italy could have
scored<00:05:04.520> four<00:05:05.210> goals<00:05:06.190> easily<00:05:07.190> Germany<00:05:07.910> could

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
scored four goals easily Germany could

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.270 
scored four goals easily Germany could
scored<00:05:08.300> one<00:05:08.420> or<00:05:08.510> two<00:05:08.600> goals<00:05:08.810> easily<00:05:09.350> too<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:09.980> i

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
scored one or two goals easily too but i

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.430 
scored one or two goals easily too but i
would<00:05:10.790> say<00:05:10.910> italy<00:05:11.300> they<00:05:11.630> definitely<00:05:12.050> won<00:05:12.320> that

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
would say italy they definitely won that

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.770 
would say italy they definitely won that
game<00:05:12.530> fair<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:12.800> square<00:05:12.950> i<00:05:13.600> was<00:05:14.600> really

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
germany and italy and also the the other

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.300 
germany and italy and also the the other
semifinal<00:06:50.050> game<00:06:50.410> between<00:06:50.560> Portugal<00:06:51.010> and

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
semifinal game between Portugal and

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.110 
semifinal game between Portugal and
Spain<00:06:51.720> well<00:06:52.720> my<00:06:53.200> thoughts<00:06:53.470> on<00:06:53.860> italy<00:06:54.460> vs<00:06:54.760> spain

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
Spain well my thoughts on italy vs spain

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.150 
Spain well my thoughts on italy vs spain
i'm<00:06:55.510> probably<00:06:55.810> going<00:06:56.020> to<00:06:56.140> pull<00:06:56.350> for<00:06:56.650> italy

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
i'm probably going to pull for italy

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.910 
i'm probably going to pull for italy
even<00:06:58.060> though<00:06:58.150> they<00:06:58.240> be<00:06:58.390> germany<00:06:58.840> i<00:06:58.990> I<00:06:59.320> think

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
even though they be germany i I think

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.580 
even though they be germany i I think
that<00:07:00.100> Spain's<00:07:00.610> one<00:07:00.940> too<00:07:01.090> many<00:07:01.180> times<00:07:01.450> in<00:07:01.780> the

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
that Spain's one too many times in the

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.500 
that Spain's one too many times in the
last<00:07:02.740> few<00:07:02.980> years<00:07:03.040> so<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.850> think<00:07:03.940> it's<00:07:04.180> time<00:07:04.300> for

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
last few years so I think it's time for

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.410 
last few years so I think it's time for
italy<00:07:04.810> to<00:07:05.050> win<00:07:05.290> something<00:07:05.620> for<00:07:05.770> themselves<00:07:05.980> I

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
italy to win something for themselves I

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.120
