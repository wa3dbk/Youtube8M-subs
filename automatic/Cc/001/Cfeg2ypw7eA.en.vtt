to do is just have my my locks just kind
of<00:00:50.870> spreading<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.059> either

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of spreading out on going in either

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.700 
of spreading out on going in either
direction<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> way

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
direction so I want some going this way

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.779 
direction so I want some going this way
once<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.550> way

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
once I'm going this way

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
once I'm going this way
but<00:00:57.210> ultimately<00:00:57.629> everything<00:00:58.020> needs<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> be

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
but ultimately everything needs to be

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
but ultimately everything needs to be
coming<00:00:58.980> down<00:00:59.129> too<00:00:59.520> behind<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.989> ear<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
coming down too behind my right ear so

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
coming down too behind my right ear so
it<00:01:02.010> looks<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.250> everything<00:01:02.940> started<00:01:03.359> around

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it looks like everything started around

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.830 
it looks like everything started around
here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.119> go<00:01:06.150> kollene

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
here and then it's just like go kollene

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.010 
here and then it's just like go kollene
out<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.020> smooth

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
out and then I'm going to smooth

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.179 
out and then I'm going to smooth
everything<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:12.409> I'm<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> back<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> be

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
everything down I'm at the back to be

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
everything down I'm at the back to be
super<00:01:14.729> smooth<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.259> back

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
super smooth because all of this back

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.170 
super smooth because all of this back
here<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.479> visible<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.939> smooth<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here is going to be visible so smooth it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.499 
here is going to be visible so smooth it
down<00:01:21.950> okay<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.220> once<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:26.509> smooth

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
down okay now once you got that smooth

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.530 
down okay now once you got that smooth
down<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:28.200> pretty<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:29.090> start<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> front

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
down all pretty like start at the front

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.399 
down all pretty like start at the front
and

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.639 

this<00:01:36.409> bring<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.890> back<00:01:37.070> as<00:01:37.960> if<00:01:38.960> you're<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:39.439> to

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
this bring it back as if you're going to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:49.310 
this bring it back as if you're going to
flip<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.890> just<00:01:42.890> like<00:01:43.100> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.560 

and<00:01:49.830> then<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> gotta<00:01:50.220> smooth<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:54.330> in<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and then you gotta smooth this in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then you gotta smooth this in the
back<00:01:54.780> under<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.490> flip<00:01:56.760> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
back under what so we just flip this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
back under what so we just flip this
here<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.230> to<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.440> sure<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.830> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here so you want to make sure that this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.670 
here so you want to make sure that this
part<00:01:59.400> here<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.840> under<00:02:00.840> everything<00:02:01.170> needs<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
part here is under everything needs to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.110 
part here is under everything needs to
be<00:02:01.830> smooth<00:02:02.160> at<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.490> back<00:02:04.070> okay<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.310> then

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
be smooth at the back okay and then

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.469 
be smooth at the back okay and then
we're<00:02:06.300> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:07.610> fold<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.880> part<00:02:09.240> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
we're going to fold down the part that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.420 
we're going to fold down the part that
we<00:02:09.570> smooth<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:12.620> take<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> bunch<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> front

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
we smooth and take a bunch at the front

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.710 
we smooth and take a bunch at the front
and<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> little<00:02:15.360> bit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and you're gonna have like a little bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.210 
and you're gonna have like a little bit
of<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.960> whole<00:02:16.110> bunch<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.380> hair<00:02:16.560> falling<00:02:17.040> down

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
of a whole bunch of hair falling down

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.370 
of a whole bunch of hair falling down
this<00:02:17.520> direction<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.780> you're<00:02:19.020> gonna<00:02:19.170> take<00:02:19.320> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
this direction so you're gonna take a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.200 
this direction so you're gonna take a
whole<00:02:19.590> bunch<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:20.400> got<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> whole<00:02:21.060> bunch

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
whole bunch of here or got a whole bunch

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.020 
whole bunch of here or got a whole bunch
but<00:02:21.480> nice<00:02:21.720> handful<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.730> bring<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but nice handful and then just bring it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.470 
but nice handful and then just bring it
right<00:02:24.300> over<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:25.670> bunch<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.240> go<00:02:27.390> ahead

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
right over that bunch and then go ahead

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.170 
right over that bunch and then go ahead
and<00:02:27.780> seals<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> out<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:32.850> ahead<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and seals that out and go ahead and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.560 
and seals that out and go ahead and
smooth<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> back<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.930> well<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.090> all<00:02:36.360> we're

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
smooth in the back as well so all we're

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.810 
smooth in the back as well so all we're
doing<00:02:36.900> basically<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.890> huge<00:02:38.370> flat

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
doing basically is like one huge flat

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.520 
doing basically is like one huge flat
twist<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.810> makes<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:42.410> don't<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
twist but what makes this I don't know I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.020 
twist but what makes this I don't know I
guess<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> little<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.070> more<00:02:44.190> challenging<00:02:44.850> is

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
guess a little bit more challenging is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.250 
guess a little bit more challenging is
all<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.360> smoothing<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.900> know<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.050> keep<00:02:46.200> saying

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
all this smoothing I know I keep saying

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.380 
all this smoothing I know I keep saying
smooth<00:02:46.739> over<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.190> over<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.120> lot<00:02:48.270> of

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
smooth over and over again it's a lot of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.660 
smooth over and over again it's a lot of
smoothing<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.459> back

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
smoothing going on so that the back

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.190 
smoothing going on so that the back
looks<00:02:51.510> nice<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:53.580> yeah<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.600> essence<00:02:55.050> it's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
looks nice but yeah it's in essence it's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.470 
looks nice but yeah it's in essence it's
just<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.530> huge<00:02:55.830> flat<00:02:56.070> twist<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> pulled

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
just one huge flat twist so I pulled

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.820 
just one huge flat twist so I pulled
another<00:02:57.810> bunch<00:02:58.080> back<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:59.130> that<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:02.430> I'm

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.710 

gonna<00:03:07.830> pull<00:03:08.100> here<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.820> now<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.390> point

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
gonna pull here so now at this point

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.890 
gonna pull here so now at this point
when<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.049> get<00:03:10.230> around<00:03:10.470> your<00:03:10.650> ear<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> get

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
when you get around your ear and you get

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.050 
when you get around your ear and you get
around<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.290> ear<00:03:13.560> all<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.519> down<00:03:14.730> here<00:03:14.970> is

around your ear all this down here is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.699 
around your ear all this down here is
going<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.269> start<00:03:15.510> falling<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:16.560> you're

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
going to start falling so now you're

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.410 
going to start falling so now you're
gonna<00:03:16.799> start<00:03:17.010> taking<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.970> hair

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
gonna start taking all of this hair

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.360 
gonna start taking all of this hair
you're<00:03:18.690> gonna<00:03:18.780> smooth<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.170> all<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:20.010> way<00:03:20.130> back

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you're gonna smooth it all the way back

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.810 
you're gonna smooth it all the way back
and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:21.660> use<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.370> wrap<00:03:23.610> around

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
and then use that here to wrap around

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.410 
and then use that here to wrap around
this<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.170> let<00:03:25.410> me<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.769> if<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.040> show<00:03:26.220> you

under let me show you go under that

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.199 
under let me show you go under that
those<00:03:33.900> locks<00:03:36.950> pulling<00:03:37.950> them<00:03:38.100> out<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.970> here

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
those locks pulling them out so here

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.140 
those locks pulling them out so here
goes<00:03:39.450> those<00:03:39.900> locks<00:03:40.230> right<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:40.970> on<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.000> side

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
goes those locks right here on that side

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.090 
goes those locks right here on that side
and<00:03:43.080> then<00:03:43.410> we're<00:03:43.530> gonna<00:03:43.620> take<00:03:43.920> those<00:03:46.100> along

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and then we're gonna take those along

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.800 
and then we're gonna take those along
with<00:03:47.130> some<00:03:47.430> other<00:03:47.580> locks<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.120> just<00:03:48.330> take<00:03:48.600> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
with some other locks and just take it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.530 
with some other locks and just take it
right<00:03:49.110> over

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
right over

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.400 
right over
just<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.379> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
you're gonna keep on doing this until

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.950 
you're gonna keep on doing this until
you<00:04:03.300> take<00:04:04.300> it<00:04:04.330> down<00:04:04.630> as<00:04:04.990> far<00:04:05.740> as<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:06.160> want<00:04:06.960> and

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
you take it down as far as you want and

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.460 
you take it down as far as you want and
the<00:04:08.260> tighter<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.920> pull<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.030> hair<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:11.200> more

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
the tighter you pull the hair the more

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.720 
the tighter you pull the hair the more
curved<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:13.570> going<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:15.250> more<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.490> a<00:04:15.550> curve

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
curved it's going to the more of a curve

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
curved it's going to the more of a curve
it's<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.120> create<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.920> go<00:04:18.070> ahead

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
it's going to create so you can go ahead

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.560 
it's going to create so you can go ahead
and<00:04:18.370> put<00:04:19.360> this<00:04:19.480> in<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.720> bun<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:21.240> want<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.300> leave<00:04:22.450> it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and put this in a bun I want to leave it

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.870 
and put this in a bun I want to leave it
out<00:04:22.920> you'll<00:04:23.920> notice<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.430> have<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> whole

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
out you'll notice that I have a whole

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.940 
out you'll notice that I have a whole
bunch<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.120> different<00:04:25.240> lengths<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.320> locs<00:04:26.590> here

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
bunch of different lengths of locs here

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.520 
bunch of different lengths of locs here
so<00:04:27.490> I'm<00:04:27.700> gonna<00:04:27.850> take<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.360> longest<00:04:28.600> locs<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
so I'm gonna take the longest locs the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.810 
so I'm gonna take the longest locs the
longest<00:04:29.890> lengths<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.310> I'm<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> use

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
longest lengths and I'm going to use

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.570 
longest lengths and I'm going to use
that<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.330> tie<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.140> secure<00:04:32.590> with<00:04:33.190> one<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.490> my

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
that to tie and secure with one of my

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.580 
that to tie and secure with one of my
long<00:04:33.760> bobby<00:04:34.030> pins<00:04:34.300> take<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:34.960> all<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.380> way

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
long bobby pins take this all the way

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.120
