00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 it's an app that pulled out the train station 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.059
 he really little time on cigars 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.419
 so what to do about it 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.739
 the r servers 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.009
 to know if like that stirs rpr in mind 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.319
 however, if available only to buyers who use 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.869
 WHo 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.819
 Debacq 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.669
 so in fact so 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.059
 she crosses for them as her marks in the description 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 if we go down his destiny 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.400
 so 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.730
 it's actually to broadcast your photos on your match screen 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.000
 vaud 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 via itunes nice 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.810
 menu 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.360
 commune a video on youtube 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.540
 but not your videos on 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.170
 the cameras 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.750
 it's his binding cape 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.060
 so for love that's it 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.450
 then in the description of the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.760
 the rural video link to launch the pair servers program 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.040
 free for his match 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420
 after the worry of getting back to 5% 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 he is father of two children asked to find me on our game himself 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280
 recharge 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 that I mean 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.140
 so here is after installing the flavor 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 you will have the apps on the other 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 the springboks 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380
 washington rest of this session 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.640
 so the application launched this one 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 but that one 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.400
 So here is 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.110
 then it's simple 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 they do not respect a shoreline case 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 at the top 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 for example this I think I'm going to party 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.980
 I will put on music online 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.400
 so I'm going so 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 at the time 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.460
 I go in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.409
 I take the chance musicos 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.559
 a little time I'm going to take 6 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.519
 this one for example 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.359
 c 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.359
 appropriate them to that level 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.049
 and here I am I will have the possibility of goal 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.749
 to send the music on my under the brand 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749
 so those in the group 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.110
 and there I was able 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.409
 click on play 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 the mother would know 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.339
 so if you want to show it for example oddo photo 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:02.499
 the polemicist that the screen it takes nor smaller if you want to show on 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.459
 the other 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.359
 be your mac 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.289

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 I will show you the pictures for example 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.789
 fifteen days show a handkerchief 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.369
 won 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 I press the button at the top right 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.799
 he chose my macbook 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.579
 so you have a big effort 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.619
 to Montreal 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.280
 so here it is ctl bank r it's a drink 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.050
 stadium orders 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.869
 recchi software 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:47.239
 on your lesson your mac so the software is that nobody 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.019
 so here it was roma for the show that I also believe you have 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.359
 any question asked about the opponent 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.299
