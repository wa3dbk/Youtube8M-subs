00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.840
 my buddy is favorite to do before it's 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.140
 these infants 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.710
 a financial package 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.779
 but also 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.109
 the taste of the Caribbean 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.449
 the cost of sunburn holidays the cost of the yellow sea 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.879
 because I did well 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.189
 it's like brutal 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.259
 justo relax at home 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.960
 arm positiver 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.789
 from Manspach 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.009
 you have it well before using it 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.009
 it must be cut into pieces 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.130
 put it in your case 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.580
 this way 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.350
 and to add three teaspoons 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 powdered sugar 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 separates it from Charente like that we will crush 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.180
 however, it remains stable 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.630
 we will be able to extract all this money 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.500
 the secret of the mountain also 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.040
 if I'm troubled after 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 nevertheless these impasses his father 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.220
 for early andrea 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.440
 and finally rum 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.810
 I did not use for two hours 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.890
 it may have been a little easier to soak up the end of the year but 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.930
 if you ever have white rum at home, it's going to be busy 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 here are a little near four five yards 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.190
 but it is the decline of the crude begins again 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.880
 when you have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.280
 to build extract 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.740
 under this tree 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.490

 bought in flames 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 I do TV at home use it was actually for me 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.910
 add a little bit 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.810
 obedience 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.360
 to mix everything 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.800
 which we do not know how to do 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.260
 thanks to risk of sinking on the side 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.440
 mix well 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.130
 but did he add thirty years earlier 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.950
 a few drops of water with summations of suede to create a little cloud 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.230
 it will still cost you your hotel is well known his business 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.559

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.799
 amaury early 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.059
