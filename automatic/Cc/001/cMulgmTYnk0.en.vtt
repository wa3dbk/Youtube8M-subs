00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.820
 this significantly altered not only

 of the metro contemplated the possibility

 of an architecture not only functional 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.849
 but of artistic value the san station

 construction background 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.830
 similar in the city so the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.349
 simple design of a station was already a 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.959
 challenge the passage of time has not taken away 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.410
 beauty to this station one of the most 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.000
 remarkable in architectural terms the 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.250
 arrival of the metro to the candelaria of the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.989
 ducks brought modernity to this neighborhood the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.940
 architect Felix Candela designed this 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.739
 station and others of line 1 as san

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.050
 if there is any place in the city that 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.390
 never sleep that is the central position of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.990
 some station controls the traffic of 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.409
 trains and distributes the fate of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.969
 millions of passengers 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.679
 the central control post is 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.300
 located in the heart of the capital in 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.919
 water diving an office that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.899
 observe all the futuristic environment of
