00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
at the time when we did it but you start

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.020 
at the time when we did it but you start
seeing<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:02.030> pattern<00:01:02.859> in<00:01:03.859> here<00:01:04.489> like<00:01:04.640> this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
seeing this pattern in here like this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.800 
seeing this pattern in here like this
hopefully<00:01:05.810> zoom<00:01:06.560> in<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.800> ya<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.570> see

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
hopefully zoom in for ya you can see

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.749 
hopefully zoom in for ya you can see
that<00:01:08.990> pattern

that pattern

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.340 
that pattern
it<00:01:10.759> creates<00:01:11.119> by<00:01:11.420> taking<00:01:11.780> something<00:01:12.080> from<00:01:12.259> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
it creates by taking something from the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.950 
it creates by taking something from the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.200 
the idea what I'm doing here really not
hard<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:10.009> takes<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.310> little<00:02:10.399> practice<00:02:10.640> if

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
hard just takes a little practice if

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.660 
hard just takes a little practice if
you're<00:02:11.300> doing<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.690> yourself<00:02:12.400> finding<00:02:13.400> isn't

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
you're doing on yourself finding isn't

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.950 
you're doing on yourself finding isn't
growing<00:02:13.850> my<00:02:14.000> hair<00:02:14.030> out<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.450> definitely<00:02:14.840> it's

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
growing my hair out it definitely it's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.890 
growing my hair out it definitely it's
easier<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.590> these

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
easier to do these

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.520 
easier to do these
my<00:02:16.230> girls<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.980> myself<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.750> can't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
my girls that is myself so I can't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.550 
my girls that is myself so I can't
guarantee<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> will<00:02:20.310> be<00:02:20.900> easy<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
guarantee that it will be easy on you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.940 
guarantee that it will be easy on you
but<00:02:23.129> with<00:02:23.280> practice<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.629> found<00:02:24.950> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
but with practice as I have found it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.789 
but with practice as I have found it
gets<00:02:26.129> easier<00:02:26.840> anyway<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.379> keep<00:02:28.680> going

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
gets easier anyway so you can keep going

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.390 
gets easier anyway so you can keep going
down<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:30.680> fishtail<00:02:31.680> fishbone

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
down but this is a fishtail fishbone

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.670 
down but this is a fishtail fishbone
