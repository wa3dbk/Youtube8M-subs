00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
really hard I can get it to go like if I

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.440 
really hard I can get it to go like if I
hit<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:32.470> against<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:32.950> table<00:00:33.100> or<00:00:33.580> something<00:00:33.790> you

hit it against a table or something you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.720 
hit it against a table or something you
can<00:00:34.600> get<00:00:34.990> to<00:00:35.140> lock<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.950> that's<00:00:36.130> about<00:00:36.370> it

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
can get to lock but that's about it

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.150 
can get to lock but that's about it
um<00:00:37.200> obviously<00:00:38.200> hitting<00:00:38.650> your<00:00:38.740> phone<00:00:38.980> is

against<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.580> table<00:00:39.910> is<00:00:39.970> not<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.150> good<00:00:40.300> idea<00:00:40.420> so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
against the table is not a good idea so

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.280 
against the table is not a good idea so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.320 
was broken you could use that and let me
get<00:01:50.560> back<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.790> let<00:01:52.000> me<00:01:52.090> go<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
get back to it but let me go to the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.020 
get back to it but let me go to the
device<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.870> there's<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.440> lock<00:01:53.799> screen<00:01:54.460> button

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
device and there's a lock screen button

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.570 
device and there's a lock screen button
so<00:01:55.450> that's<00:01:55.600> great<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.049> helps<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.710> well<00:01:57.460> it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
so that's great it helps you well it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.890 
so that's great it helps you well it
doesn't<00:01:57.790> help<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.120> it<00:01:58.240> locks<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.510> screen<00:01:58.600> for

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
doesn't help you it locks the screen for

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.240 
doesn't help you it locks the screen for
you<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.530> lock<00:01:59.710> button<00:01:59.950> would<00:02:00.100> do

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
you just like the lock button would do

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.060 
you just like the lock button would do
you<00:02:00.760> also<00:02:00.909> have<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.180> few<00:02:01.360> other<00:02:01.540> things<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
you also have a few other things like so

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.550 
you also have a few other things like so
if<00:02:03.250> your<00:02:03.460> mute<00:02:03.670> button<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.060> broken<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:05.350> can

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
if your mute button is broken you can

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.039 
if your mute button is broken you can
unmute<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.070> mute<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.540> valium<00:02:07.900> up

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
unmute and mute you have the valium up

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.389 
unmute and mute you have the valium up
and<00:02:08.229> down<00:02:08.349> switch<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.009> these<00:02:09.129> guys<00:02:09.340> are

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
and down switch so if these guys are

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.300 
and down switch so if these guys are
broken<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.940> could<00:02:10.179> do<00:02:10.299> that<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.099> is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
broken you could do that and so that is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.769 
broken you could do that and so that is
really<00:02:12.610> cool<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.939> then<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.209> also<00:02:13.329> have<00:02:13.480> shake

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:13.779 
really cool and then you also have shake

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.709 
really cool and then you also have shake
which<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:15.609> shake<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.029> phone<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> so

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
which will shake the phone for you so

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.450 
which will shake the phone for you so
like<00:02:16.900> it'll<00:02:17.469> put<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.859> in

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
like it'll put it in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.130 
like it'll put it in
shuffle<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.910> stuff<00:02:19.180> if<00:02:19.390> you're<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> iPod

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
shuffle and stuff if you're in the iPod

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.680 
shuffle and stuff if you're in the iPod
so<00:02:20.680> that's<00:02:20.890> all<00:02:21.070> cool<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.180> could<00:02:22.450> use

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
so that's all cool so you could use

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.290 
so that's all cool so you could use
these<00:02:23.020> things<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:23.800> around<00:02:24.130> not<00:02:24.610> having

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
these things to get around not having

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.580 
these things to get around not having
the<00:02:26.520> certain<00:02:27.520> buttons<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.420> real<00:02:28.990> trouble

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
the certain buttons now the real trouble

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.610 
the certain buttons now the real trouble
would<00:02:29.800> be<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.790> home<00:02:31.540> button<00:02:31.870> was<00:02:32.290> not

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
would be if your home button was not

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.590 
would be if your home button was not
working<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.610> couldn't<00:02:34.000> hit<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.390> triple

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
working you couldn't hit the triple

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.830 
working you couldn't hit the triple
click<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.530> you'd<00:02:35.710> have<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.840> let's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
click so you'd have to just go to let's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.590 
click so you'd have to just go to let's
go<00:02:37.960> back<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.470> you'd<00:02:39.070> have<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.460> to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
go back and you'd have to go to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.580 
go back and you'd have to go to
accessibility<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.230> showed<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> before

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
accessibility like I showed you before

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.460 
accessibility like I showed you before
and<00:02:42.070> just<00:02:42.100> turn<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.030> assistive<00:02:43.660> touch<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
and just turn the assistive touch on and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.560 
and just turn the assistive touch on and
it<00:02:45.130> would<00:02:45.250> always<00:02:45.490> be<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.910> though<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.210> then

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
it would always be on though and then

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.720 
it would always be on though and then
though<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.930> could<00:02:47.230> hit<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.740> home<00:02:48.700> button

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
though you could hit the home button

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.120 
though you could hit the home button
take<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.210> take<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.480> home

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
which I mean that would be really bad if

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.100 
which I mean that would be really bad if
your<00:02:53.440> home<00:02:53.560> button<00:02:53.770> went<00:02:54.250> out<00:02:54.340> cuz<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:56.050> know
