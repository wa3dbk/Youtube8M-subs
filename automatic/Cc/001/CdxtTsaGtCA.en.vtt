00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340 

I<00:00:00.890> know<00:00:01.890> most<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.460> have<00:00:02.639> never<00:00:02.790> seen<00:00:03.350> marks

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
I know most of you have never seen marks

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.390 
I know most of you have never seen marks
of<00:00:04.470> action<00:00:05.120> but<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.299> actually<00:00:07.250> performing<00:00:08.250> it

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
of action but I'm actually performing it

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
of action but I'm actually performing it
on<00:00:08.610> myself<00:00:10.880> it's<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.030> tool<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.570> stimulate

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
on myself it's a tool to stimulate

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.400 
on myself it's a tool to stimulate
circulation<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:18.470> basically<00:00:21.020> here<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> what

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
circulation and basically here is what

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.210 
circulation and basically here is what
it<00:00:22.500> looks<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.830> rather<00:00:26.070> large

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it looks like that is my rather large

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790 
it looks like that is my rather large
get<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> moment<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.800> stimulating

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
get at the moment which I'm stimulating

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.450 
get at the moment which I'm stimulating
to<00:00:29.990> see<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.230> break<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.250> lose

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to see if I can break down and lose

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
to see if I can break down and lose
weight<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:33.120> max<00:00:33.390> function<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> can

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
weight for max function and so you can

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.639 
weight for max function and so you can
begin<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:39.379> with<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.680> rather<00:00:41.129> large<00:00:42.649> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
begin to see with a rather large you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.510 
begin to see with a rather large you
know<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:45.350> let<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.440> try<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.149> configure<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:49.219> to

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.860 

ostensibly<00:00:54.350> as<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.470> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.880> sucks<00:00:57.510> up

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
ostensibly as you can see it sucks up

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.100 
ostensibly as you can see it sucks up
the<00:00:58.410> skin<00:00:58.880> it's<00:00:59.880> a<00:01:00.060> little<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.330> painful<00:01:00.630> think

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
the skin it's a little bit painful think

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.780 
the skin it's a little bit painful think
it's<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.320> tightly<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.190> she<00:01:02.340> could<00:01:02.490> swore

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
it's very tightly and she could swore

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.750 
it's very tightly and she could swore
them<00:01:02.970> ready<00:01:04.760> right<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.910> right

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
them ready right that's right

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.920 
them ready right that's right

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.270 

I'm<00:01:15.230> putting<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:17.690> number<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.230> oh<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:22.100> this

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
I'm putting it on number of oh so this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.610 
I'm putting it on number of oh so this
is<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:24.800> looks<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:26.620> actually

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
is what it looks like I actually

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.700 
is what it looks like I actually
hopefully<00:01:28.160> can<00:01:28.340> find<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.610> mirror<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.650> can

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
hopefully can find a mirror so you can

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.320 
hopefully can find a mirror so you can
see<00:01:32.200> I'm<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.470> pool<00:01:33.680> actually<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.180> can

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
see I'm in the pool actually if you can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.780 
see I'm in the pool actually if you can
imagine<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.990> was<00:01:36.530> hoping<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:38.750> do<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.790> the
