ever tried to untangle a huge mess of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
ever tried to untangle a huge mess of
string<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.949> how<00:00:26.070> difficult<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.730> can

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
string you know how difficult this can

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
string you know how difficult this can
be<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.359> cells<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.900> able<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.320> access

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
be your cells have to be able to access

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.510 
be your cells have to be able to access
the<00:00:29.699> DNA<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.439> do<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> organized

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the DNA and do this in a organized

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.540 
the DNA and do this in a organized
fashion<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:34.110> fact<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.829> DNA<00:00:35.280> does<00:00:35.520> not

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
fashion so in fact your DNA does not

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.569 
fashion so in fact your DNA does not
exist<00:00:36.450> by<00:00:36.899> itself<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> nucleus<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
exist by itself and the nucleus of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.060 
exist by itself and the nucleus of
yourself<00:00:39.000> cells<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> wound<00:00:40.829> around

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
yourself cells it is wound around

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.170 
yourself cells it is wound around
proteins<00:00:41.879> called<00:00:42.120> histones<00:00:43.489> these<00:00:44.489> histones

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
proteins called histones these histones

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
proteins called histones these histones
and<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.140> DNA<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.129> wound<00:00:47.399> around<00:00:47.610> them

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and the DNA that is wound around them

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.270 
and the DNA that is wound around them
are<00:00:48.149> together<00:00:48.390> called<00:00:48.930> chromatin<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
are together called chromatin so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
are together called chromatin so
chromatin<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> complex<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.050> DNA

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
chromatin is like this complex of DNA

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
chromatin is like this complex of DNA
that<00:00:52.559> has<00:00:52.680> wound<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.360> chromatins<00:00:54.360> purpose<00:00:54.780> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that has wound up chromatins purpose is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
that has wound up chromatins purpose is
to<00:00:55.320> organize<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.190> DNA<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to organize your DNA and to make it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.869 
to organize your DNA and to make it
accessible<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.039> different<00:00:59.250> cells<00:00:59.670> at

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
accessible that to different cells at

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
accessible that to different cells at
different<00:00:59.910> times<00:01:01.640> chromatin<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.470> compact

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
different times chromatin is compact

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.539 
different times chromatin is compact
looped<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.580> compact<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> again<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
looped and compact it again and this is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
looped and compact it again and this is
what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> eventually<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> chromosome

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what we eventually see as a chromosome

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
what we eventually see as a chromosome
so<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> fact<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> chromosome<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> simply

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
so in fact a chromosome is simply

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
so in fact a chromosome is simply
condensed<00:01:13.250> chromatin<00:01:14.420> when<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.570> looking

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
condensed chromatin when you're looking

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
condensed chromatin when you're looking
at<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> chromosome<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.130> one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
at a chromosome you're looking at one

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.859 
at a chromosome you're looking at one
strand<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.330> 46<00:01:19.140> strands<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.310> DNA<00:01:20.869> compact

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
strand of your 46 strands of DNA compact

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.100 
strand of your 46 strands of DNA compact
wound<00:01:22.680> around<00:01:22.890> proteins<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.700> packed<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
wound around proteins and packed up in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190 
wound around proteins and packed up in
your<00:01:25.259> nucleus<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.780> string
