00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.260
 as every year the two great football simulation clash in 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.379
 a match is ruthless we return to score 0 for these new opus 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.639
 on one side and fifa the challenger has defeated since his arrival on our 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.079
 consoles buy each other a pro evolution soccer somewhere else that remain 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.070
 on the key after having reigned supreme throughout the period of the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.199
 peace unleashed since 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.680
 for the 2012 vintage the two competitors focused on renovating the 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.920
 gameplay but in a different way defense system 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.310
 much more precise that to defend on its own 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's a lot less sexy 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.379
 it really takes a really good time to intercept these 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.329
 before this defendable identity only three emanating it's really for 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.650
 main so 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.680
 really if if you too do not depend on him it's really the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 road the dribble system is much more accurate you can dribble 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.260
 in much narrower spaces 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.550
 so the offer was really a defensive attack and defenders 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.950
 do you really have to be very strong attackers like drogba and his therapy 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.300
 this year we do a little bit more in the midfield we could 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.540
 find that fifa had made efforts to propose a defense less 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.289
 cyclic 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.850
 and a new high performance dribbling system 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 yet she is in the dribbling system has already evolved well in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.370
 previous opus the developers have decided to refocus on the game 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.550
 equipped with 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.290
 special attention was paid to intelligence 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.820
 artificial of your teammates the placement of the players and the calls of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.340
 ball will be much more present and the matches promise a better 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 game dynamics 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.190
 the last in Casablanca will be a great moment in terms of graphics 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.910
 this year 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 the real improvements before any success on the 20 gameplay 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.070
 it's really been redefined players the ancient remains of 6 years 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.940
 to navigate 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.160
 however found a gameplay term the same the same sensations as 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.010
 that at the time 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.940
 we have the ability now with the right stick 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.760
 takes control of a second directly controlled player sent 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.660
 the balloon or just to make calls 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.160
 for more realistic shot that will inevitably go to what we do 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.170
 so there you know by looking at this sum will be there to serve 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.930
 when we are going to be in multi pay 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 to be able to take control very easily and very intuitively 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.390
 players 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.170
 that one is on the ground with so soon the bill let go on the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.900
 ground 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 finally the pumped senate is more than once 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.340
 had stopped the teenager in front of my little guy well and has one 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.989
 it's a targeted hit 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.290
 it's this cold flaw they will dispute the Olympic ticket how are you 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.419
 want to tell you that you can not hope I can 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.749
 see here - the bomba latina bautista c to the rule had problems 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.219
 techniques moved the falls following the king's sister explains max not and this 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.579
 since the morning by the port authorities I think 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.260
 in annaba it is also with this theme after I hold it but it's true 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.619
 that it's not a single defeat this time things m in this folder 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.059
 bcg guy who does not talk about madness 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.359
 from a technical point of view the graphics engine of both I remain cautious 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.900
 he says nevertheless many elements will not be finished 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.480
 for fifa the big evolution is at the physical engine level with a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.599
 new system of bluffing collisions 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.299
 as for the frankness of tf1 the emphasis was put on the realism of the faces 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.650
 and expressions for these assets with the new engine that had since 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.179
 three to four years ago we arrived a little after something 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.029
 we were very pleasantly surprised stems from the new collision engine 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.189
 have been added this year finally and this is a point on which I feel 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.059
 super expensive the team met for the players to get lost collision 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.349
 was not very realistic the development team as to vancouver then 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.569
 to develop this new collision engine 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.969
 this album factors a factory which allows to have a continuation of 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.409
 collision that are much more realistic to have real impacts of 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.449
 players who have a behavior that is 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.729
 much more realistic and it completely changes the the game the system of 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.809
 collusion it has changed a lot it's much more realistic 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.009
 there - against less weird stuff from past mourning it's a lot more 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.519
 realistically that's what we do it's really 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.799
 according to bfm with things had already been working well on the version 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.270
 2011 again this year to his improved record 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.950
 % from this point of view now it's not what it will do the basics% and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.660
 of a game like nobody at the moment it's really very good 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.020
 further improvements when we look at what is needed and that's 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.540
 really blatant in terms of animation of course there's enough uncertain 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.150
 of animation that make the game even more fluid 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.000
 play and after that when we're away and on the modalities we really see 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.309
 one an improvement in term 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.699
 rendering of expression faces to go before all these 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.389
 improvements that have been added and that really make a game a lot 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.219
 more real 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.329
 it will be understood ps put before all on a gameplay more neat than the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.269
 previous games 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.669
 highlighting the new player management system and intelligence 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.360
 artificial of your teammates 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.020
 while fifa at cross the realism of his game with this new physics engine 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.639
 impressive 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.720
 finally the fifa developers took the lead in announcing a new 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.220
 community platform 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220
 he is especially the club of which we speak right davis 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.889
 the local officials at the afp and that n ugly lowers somehow does 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.309
 three years that i am in my opinion of china in france 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:48.289
 the sncc while the numbers to make it alassane ouattara whether it is 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.739
 a story written by aof the others with its strengths the car ready 

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:56.050
 this is the sharp rise with the fry packages 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.170
 anne is a modern unit feyenoord feyenoord panex ps tip stasi 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.210
 experience for the score that will not settle there 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.009
 aged 47 and over from 4% 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.160
 it's as if you needed is said tim what are you doing when 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.699
 even 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.819
 a section his companion in 35 years know how advanced if women 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.839
 at one point he must have passed he complained about this sport affair has 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.589
 makes a great race for kids 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.550
 with regard to this mythical car associative room 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.169
 with twenty years around the world this is an excuse for the 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.390
 sleep but also with a positive experience of society 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.249
 the developers of neglect not wish to speak about it 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.979
 but he plans to make an announcement in the coming days about a 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.979
 new online gaming system to exchange old games 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.810
 on both sides the ads makes you want and is catching up late 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.290
 that he dug with his eternal competitor by returning to the basics of his 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.770
 Thu 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.370
 the simplest and most effective 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.490
 they do not forget the tactical side 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.370
 but takes advantage of his lead to tackle ps by pushing the realism of the 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.339
 game to its climax with this physics engine 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:02.959
 further improvements bring too much dribbling to the defense allow to 

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.159
 really renew the game system to provide new sensations 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.180
 kick off end of September
