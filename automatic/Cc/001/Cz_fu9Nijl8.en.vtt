to line up all you really want to do is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.900 
to line up all you really want to do is
back<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.239> out<00:02:26.370> back<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.519> all<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.150> way<00:02:28.300> up

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
back that out back it all the way up

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.590

when<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> top<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:36.480> will<00:02:37.480> hit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
when you get it to the top that will hit

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.140 
when you get it to the top that will hit
the<00:02:37.720> top<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:39.010> just<00:02:39.190> keep<00:02:39.370> twisting<00:02:39.940> and

as you back it up against and this this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.520 
as you back it up against and this this
brace<00:02:49.390> puts<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> pressure<00:02:49.900> on<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.200> top<00:02:50.380> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
brace puts the pressure on the top of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.620 
brace puts the pressure on the top of
the<00:02:50.590> clamp<00:02:50.830> here<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.340> back<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.819> up<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.510> it'll

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the clamp here you back it up and it'll

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.590 
the clamp here you back it up and it'll
as<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.290> backs<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.739> it'll<00:02:53.980> put<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.360> flat

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
as it backs out it'll put the the flat

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.789 
as it backs out it'll put the the flat
tip<00:02:55.810> off<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.170> c-clamp<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.720> then<00:02:58.959> when<00:02:59.709> you

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
tip off of the c-clamp so then when you

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.160 
tip off of the c-clamp so then when you
finish<00:03:00.069> that<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.430> should<00:03:00.580> look<00:03:00.670> like<00:03:00.730> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
finish that you should look like this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
finish that you should look like this
you'll<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.290> your<00:03:02.410> threaded<00:03:02.709> section<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
you'll have your threaded section and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.309 
you'll have your threaded section and
you'll<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.400> your<00:03:03.549> stud<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.030> was

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
you'll have your stud that was

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.860 
you'll have your stud that was
previously<00:03:05.319> pressed<00:03:05.680> into<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.010> flat<00:03:06.220> part

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
previously pressed into the flat part

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.590 
previously pressed into the flat part
that's<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.049> Flex<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.349> clintus<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:10.510> out

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
that's the Flex you clintus I get out

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.300 
that's the Flex you clintus I get out
your<00:03:10.750> flaring<00:03:11.079> tool<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:11.799> I've<00:03:11.950> already<00:03:12.130> done

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
your flaring tool now I've already done

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.050 
your flaring tool now I've already done
this<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:12.940> makes<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.180> look<00:03:13.299> really<00:03:13.329> easy<00:03:13.720> on

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this so it makes it look really easy on

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.280 
this so it makes it look really easy on
but<00:03:16.060> when<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.269> get<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.660> your<00:03:16.810> flaring<00:03:17.140> tool

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
but when you get it your flaring tool

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.410 
but when you get it your flaring tool
will<00:03:17.470> look<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:18.269> okay<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:20.380> will<00:03:20.680> have

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
will look like this okay it will have

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.349 
will look like this okay it will have
this<00:03:22.420> cone-shaped<00:03:23.260> point<00:03:24.060> pressed<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.269> to

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
this cone-shaped point pressed on to

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.180 
this cone-shaped point pressed on to
there<00:03:25.650> you're<00:03:26.650> going<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.829> want<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.040> do<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
there you're going to want to do the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.770 
there you're going to want to do the
same<00:03:27.400> exact<00:03:27.730> thing<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.880> get<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.269> c-clamp

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
same exact thing you get on the c-clamp

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.830 
same exact thing you get on the c-clamp
now<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:30.180> particular<00:03:31.180> model<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.630> I'm

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
now with this particular model that I'm

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.030 
now with this particular model that I'm
using<00:03:32.109> it's<00:03:33.299> it's<00:03:34.299> a<00:03:34.510> fairly<00:03:35.079> small<00:03:35.380> space<00:03:35.799> in

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
using it's it's a fairly small space in

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.280 
using it's it's a fairly small space in
between<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.609> clamp<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.569> thing<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.140> can

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
between the clamp and thing but you can

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.220 
between the clamp and thing but you can
stick<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.850> inside<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.329> here<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:40.900> back

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
stick this inside of here and then back

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.009 
stick this inside of here and then back
that<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:43.000> will<00:03:43.090> pull<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
that out and it will pull the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.870 
that out and it will pull the
cone-shaped<00:03:44.530> box<00:03:44.829> or<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.980> unprecedent

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.509 

once<00:03:48.880> that's<00:03:49.090> completed<00:03:50.100> what<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.250> want<00:03:51.459> to

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
once that's completed what you want to

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.720 
once that's completed what you want to
do<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.519> can<00:03:54.700> take<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.120> flat<00:03:55.840> piece<00:03:56.730> spin

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
do is you can take this flat piece spin

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.580 
do is you can take this flat piece spin
it<00:03:57.880> around<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.359> opposite<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.019> was<00:03:59.200> with

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it around the opposite that it was with

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.330 
it around the opposite that it was with
the<00:03:59.739> cone<00:04:00.130> shape<00:04:00.400> going<00:04:00.639> down<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:05.340> then

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
the cone shape going down like that then

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.680 
the cone shape going down like that then
take<00:04:06.370> your<00:04:06.700> cone<00:04:06.940> piece<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:07.420> took<00:04:07.540> off

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
take your cone piece that you took off

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.650 
take your cone piece that you took off
your<00:04:07.810> flaring<00:04:08.200> tool<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:09.299> just<00:04:10.299> stick<00:04:10.510> it

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
your flaring tool and just stick it

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.509 
your flaring tool and just stick it
there<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:11.620> these<00:04:11.709> pieces<00:04:11.889> won't<00:04:12.220> stay<00:04:12.459> you

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
there now these pieces won't stay you

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.129 
there now these pieces won't stay you
just<00:04:12.819> hold<00:04:13.060> them<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.269> place<00:04:13.299> until<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.900> clamp

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
just hold them in place until you clamp

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.320 
just hold them in place until you clamp
it<00:04:14.260> down<00:04:14.320> on<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.620> chain

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
it down on the chain

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:25.640 
it down on the chain
then<00:04:16.110> once<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.470> thread<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.830> down<00:04:24.650> you'll

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
then once you thread it down you'll

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.440 
then once you thread it down you'll
thread<00:04:25.920> that<00:04:26.100> point<00:04:26.370> into<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.820> open<00:04:27.180> end<00:04:27.330> of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
thread that point into the open end of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.020 
thread that point into the open end of
the<00:04:27.510> rivet<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> train<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:29.460> put<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.820> back

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the rivet on the train and put the back

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.520 
the rivet on the train and put the back
of<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.270> C<00:04:30.450> clamp<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.050> other<00:04:31.200> side<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.410> the
