Sony on the other hand proved that it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
can make all the flagship waterproof

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.270 
can make all the flagship waterproof
without<00:02:30.210> compromising<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.960> design<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.190> we

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
without compromising on design so we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.100 
without compromising on design so we
must<00:02:32.460> mention<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.120> however<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.930> would

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
must mention that however that would

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.160 
must mention that however that would
like<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.890> thinner<00:02:35.160> bezel<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:36.240> when

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
like to see a thinner bezel really when

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.290 
like to see a thinner bezel really when
it<00:02:37.290> announced<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.520> Sony<00:02:38.850> Xperia<00:02:38.910> Z

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
in early dawn 13 sony also introduced

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
in early dawn 13 sony also introduced
the<00:02:41.790> Sony<00:02:42.150> Xperia<00:02:42.210> L<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.320> wasn't<00:02:43.860> waterproof

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the Sony Xperia L this wasn't waterproof

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.510 
the Sony Xperia L this wasn't waterproof
but<00:02:44.670> had<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> smaller<00:02:45.270> case<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.040> while<00:02:47.040> keeping

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
but had a smaller case and while keeping

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.790 
but had a smaller case and while keeping
the<00:02:47.670> same<00:02:47.850> screen<00:02:48.240> instead<00:02:48.630> which<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.380> five

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
the same screen instead which was five

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.230 
the same screen instead which was five
inches<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> think<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.120> hopefully<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.260> sony

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
inches I think so hopefully the sony

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.420 
inches I think so hopefully the sony
Sony<00:02:54.240> make<00:02:54.540> took<00:02:55.380> some<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.770> lessons

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
Sony make took some you know lessons

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.790 
Sony make took some you know lessons
from<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> other<00:02:57.060> other<00:02:57.570> manufacturers<00:02:58.530> and

from the other other manufacturers and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.370 
from the other other manufacturers and
also<00:02:59.340> some<00:02:59.580> lessons<00:03:00.000> by<00:03:00.660> making<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.110> design

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
also some lessons by making the design

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.650 
also some lessons by making the design
of<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.740> Sony<00:03:02.070> Xperia<00:03:02.100> ZL<00:03:02.490> van<00:03:03.090> designing<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of the Sony Xperia ZL van designing the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.770 
of the Sony Xperia ZL van designing the
sony<00:03:03.900> serious<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.280> naturally<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> battle

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
sony serious so naturally in the battle

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.300 
sony serious so naturally in the battle
of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.959> galaxy<00:03:07.320> s5<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.800> pricing<00:03:08.190> will

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
of the galaxy s5 the pricing will

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.250 
of the galaxy s5 the pricing will
mattered<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.700> Sony's<00:03:09.630> currents<00:03:10.050> even

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
mattered a lot Sony's currents even

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.360 
mattered a lot Sony's currents even
flagship<00:03:10.680> cause<00:03:10.890> dollar<00:03:11.250> 649<00:03:11.850> unlock<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.370> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
flagship cause dollar 649 unlock and and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.800 
flagship cause dollar 649 unlock and and
I<00:03:14.430> think<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.910> good<00:03:15.060> strategy<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
I think that's a good strategy for the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.170 
I think that's a good strategy for the
Japanese<00:03:16.170> company<00:03:16.560> would<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.790> try<00:03:18.000> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
Japanese company would be to try and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.940 
Japanese company would be to try and
sell<00:03:18.390> its<00:03:18.600> next<00:03:18.900> flashy<00:03:19.080> for<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.380> unless<00:03:19.530> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
sell its next flashy for you unless a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.800 
sell its next flashy for you unless a
high-end<00:03:20.670> waterproof<00:03:21.120> smartphone<00:03:21.269> with<00:03:21.720> an

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
high-end waterproof smartphone with an

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470 
high-end waterproof smartphone with an
attractive<00:03:21.989> design<00:03:22.500> at<00:03:22.739> under<00:03:23.400> dollar<00:03:23.670> 600

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
attractive design at under dollar 600

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.270 
attractive design at under dollar 600
could<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> great<00:03:25.230> deal<00:03:25.350> for<00:03:25.560> many<00:03:25.739> customers

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
could be a great deal for many customers

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.810 
could be a great deal for many customers
so<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.900> 2014<00:03:28.830> will<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> year

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
so I think that 2014 will be the year

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.810 
so I think that 2014 will be the year
where<00:03:30.570> Samsung<00:03:31.110> will<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.430> feel<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
where Samsung will really feel the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.430 
where Samsung will really feel the
threat<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> other<00:03:33.540> Android<00:03:34.050> vendors

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
threat of the other Android vendors

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.550 
threat of the other Android vendors
including<00:03:35.040> Sony<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.700> also<00:03:36.600> there<00:03:37.080> are<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.260> lot

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
including Sony and also there are a lot

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.290 
including Sony and also there are a lot
a<00:03:37.590> lot<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.980> smartphone<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.519> will<00:03:38.820> come<00:03:39.090> in

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
a lot of smartphone that will come in

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.690 
a lot of smartphone that will come in
this<00:03:39.810> year<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.830> there<00:03:41.100> will<00:03:41.220> be<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> stiff

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
this year so there will be a stiff

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.330 
this year so there will be a stiff
competition<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.570> for<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.200> galaxy<00:03:43.620> s5<00:03:43.950> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
competition for the for the galaxy s5 so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.250 
competition for the for the galaxy s5 so
yeah<00:03:45.060> thanks<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.300> watching<00:03:45.570> guys<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.780> that
