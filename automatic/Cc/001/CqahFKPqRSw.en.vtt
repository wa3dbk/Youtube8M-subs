00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.090 

okay<00:02:03.569> that<00:02:03.750> tandem<00:02:04.110> isn't<00:02:04.439> welded<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> there

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
okay that tandem isn't welded on there
yeah<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> couldn't<00:02:05.729> find<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.000> clamp<00:02:06.330> big<00:02:06.630> enough

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
yeah I couldn't find a clamp big enough

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.259 
yeah I couldn't find a clamp big enough
to<00:02:06.990> clamp<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.880> ran<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> chain<00:02:09.239> around

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
to clamp it on so I ran a chain around

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.229 
to clamp it on so I ran a chain around
the<00:02:09.720> whole<00:02:09.899> thing<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.229> pulled<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.950> high

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
the whole thing and pulled it in high

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.550 
the whole thing and pulled it in high
and<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> take<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> test<00:02:13.080> drive<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and I'm going to take a test drive this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
and I'm going to take a test drive this
see<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.400> feels<00:02:14.579> like<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.090> about<00:02:15.359> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
see if it feels like it's in about the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.449 
see if it feels like it's in about the
right<00:02:15.660> place<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.920> I've<00:02:17.040> done<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.250> I've

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
right place what I've done is I've

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.030 
right place what I've done is I've
measured<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> tongue<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> point

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
measured from the tongue to a point

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.430 
measured from the tongue to a point
right<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> tongue<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
right here and from the tongue to the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.199 
right here and from the tongue to the
same<00:02:22.709> point<00:02:23.040> over<00:02:23.310> there<00:02:23.459> I've<00:02:23.700> lined<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
same point over there I've lined this

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.020 
same point over there I've lined this
tandem<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.230> point<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.430> lined

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
tandem up with that point it's not lined

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
tandem up with that point it's not lined
up<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.480> same<00:02:27.720> way<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.049> was<00:02:28.230> before<00:02:28.470> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
up the same way it was before but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.099 
up the same way it was before but
there's<00:02:29.640> no<00:02:29.850> straight<00:02:30.239> place<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
there's no straight place on this

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.680 
there's no straight place on this
trailer<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.790> probably<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> place<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
trailer and probably know the place to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.830 
trailer and probably know the place to
actually<00:02:33.870> find<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.880> real<00:02:35.880> center<00:02:36.269> point<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.690> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually find a real center point on it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680 
actually find a real center point on it
that<00:02:37.590> may<00:02:37.739> be<00:02:37.769> about<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.160> close<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.670> gets<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
that may be about as close as it gets so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.699 
that may be about as close as it gets so
what<00:02:39.780> I'm<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.019> do<00:02:40.109> is<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.319> out<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.470> drive

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
what I'm going to do is go out and drive

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.809 
what I'm going to do is go out and drive
it<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.069> I'm<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.280> come<00:02:41.400> back<00:02:41.579> I've<00:02:41.790> got

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
it then I'm going to come back I've got

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.340 
it then I'm going to come back I've got
some<00:02:42.120> cutting<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.690> under<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.170> because

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
some cutting to do under here because

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.870 
some cutting to do under here because
even<00:02:43.590> though<00:02:43.680> I've<00:02:43.769> got<00:02:43.950> good<00:02:44.130> clearance<00:02:44.340> here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
even though I've got good clearance here

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.330 
even though I've got good clearance here
I<00:02:45.209> love<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.290> see<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:46.769> under<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.160> but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
I'm very close to a couple of those

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'm very close to a couple of those
Center<00:02:49.260> beams<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.489> I'll<00:02:50.579> do<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.760> I'll

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
Center beams so what I'll do is I'll

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.449 
Center beams so what I'll do is I'll
turn<00:02:51.239> those<00:02:51.420> Center<00:02:51.750> beams<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.140> little<00:02:52.410> bit<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
turn those Center beams a little bit and

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.879 
turn those Center beams a little bit and
then<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.420> should<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.350> plenty<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.739> good

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
then I should have plenty of good

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.890 
then I should have plenty of good
clearance<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.000> with<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.389> said<00:02:57.660> let's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
clearance then so with that said let's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.220 
clearance then so with that said let's
go<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.290> ride

piece<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.739> asphalt<00:03:16.430> out<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.060> front<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.330> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
piece of asphalt out in front of the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.789 
piece of asphalt out in front of the
house<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.560> let<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.099> sit<00:03:19.430> flat<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.910> might<00:03:20.209> also

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.229 

uncouple<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.040> recover<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:26.209> how

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
uncouple it and recover it and see how

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:35.350 
uncouple it and recover it and see how
the<00:03:26.450> weight<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:28.690> with<00:03:29.690> nothing<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:34.360> if

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the weight is with nothing on it and if

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.030 
the weight is with nothing on it and if
I<00:03:35.510> like<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.900> I'll<00:03:35.989> girl<00:03:36.260> I'll<00:03:36.500> bring<00:03:36.680> back<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I like it I'll girl I'll bring back the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.470 
I like it I'll girl I'll bring back the
house<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.430> weld<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.730> up<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.090> I'll<00:03:38.150> do<00:03:38.299> that

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
house and weld it up and I'll do that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.150 
house and weld it up and I'll do that
cutting<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:38.989> underneath<00:03:39.349> that<00:03:39.560> needs<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.040> be

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
cutting of underneath that needs to be

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
cutting of underneath that needs to be
done

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.369 

bounced<00:03:56.980> around<00:03:57.189> a<00:03:57.549> lot<00:03:57.579> it<00:03:57.939> might<00:03:58.170> axle<00:03:59.170> might

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
bounced around a lot it might axle might

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.580 
bounced around a lot it might axle might
move<00:03:59.709> some<00:04:00.099> it<00:04:00.280> always<00:04:00.609> bouncing<00:04:01.239> but

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
move some it always bouncing but

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.979 
move some it always bouncing but
hopefully<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.680> won't<00:04:02.859> but<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.219> does<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.609> can

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
hopefully it won't but if it does I can

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.440 
hopefully it won't but if it does I can
Center<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.019> back<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.849> guess<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.030> can't<00:04:07.239> get<00:04:07.420> a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
Center it back I guess I can't get a

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.789 
Center it back I guess I can't get a
real<00:04:07.659> test<00:04:07.930> with<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.290> like<00:04:08.439> this<00:04:10.409> but<00:04:11.409> I<00:04:11.469> can

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
real test with it like this but I can

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.190 
real test with it like this but I can
like<00:04:12.159> say<00:04:12.370> uncouple<00:04:12.939> it<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.239> see<00:04:13.510> where<00:04:13.989> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
like say uncouple it and see where the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.439 
like say uncouple it and see where the
that's<00:04:14.829> one<00:04:15.069> good<00:04:15.310> way<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.549> tell<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:16.120> lot<00:04:16.389> about

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
that's one good way to tell a lot about

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.629 
that's one good way to tell a lot about
the<00:04:16.780> trailers<00:04:17.259> tell<00:04:17.500> which<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:18.220> seat<00:04:18.459> where

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
the trailers tell which is a seat where

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.129 
the trailers tell which is a seat where
the<00:04:18.820> way<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.030> is<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.269> want<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.750> little<00:04:19.900> weight

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
the way it is you want a little weight

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.779 
the way it is you want a little weight
on<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.440> tongue<00:04:20.850> even<00:04:21.850> when<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.090> empty<00:04:23.789> but

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
on the tongue even when it's empty but

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.390 
on the tongue even when it's empty but
not<00:04:24.970> too<00:04:25.180> much<00:04:25.680> after<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:27.009> one<00:04:27.160> where<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
not too much after you get one where the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.999 
not too much after you get one where the
tongue<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.789> just<00:04:28.120> about<00:04:28.360> balanced<00:04:29.009> that's

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
tongue is just about balanced that's

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.499 
tongue is just about balanced that's
pretty<00:04:30.250> good<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.669> allows<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.060> balance

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
pretty good that allows you to balance

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.089 
pretty good that allows you to balance
when<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.750> put<00:04:31.900> your<00:04:31.930> car<00:04:32.199> on<00:04:32.229> there<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:32.919> can

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
when you put your car on there you can

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.370 
when you put your car on there you can
move<00:04:33.910> your<00:04:33.970> car<00:04:34.330> backwards<00:04:34.599> and<00:04:34.930> forward<00:04:35.259> to

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
move your car backwards and forward to

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.310 
move your car backwards and forward to
find<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.710> level<00:04:36.009> spot<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.720> I'm<00:04:38.169> out

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
find the level spot with it so I'm out

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.930 
find the level spot with it so I'm out
here<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> asphalt<00:04:38.860> this<00:04:39.370> may<00:04:39.520> be<00:04:39.580> about<00:04:39.849> it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
here on the asphalt this may be about it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.029 
here on the asphalt this may be about it
level<00:04:40.300> as<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.570> gets<00:04:40.780> right<00:04:40.930> along<00:04:41.259> in<00:04:41.440> here<00:04:41.740> so

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
level as it gets right along in here so

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.710 
level as it gets right along in here so
I'll<00:04:42.400> unhook<00:04:42.759> this<00:04:42.940> thing<00:04:43.210> we'll<00:04:43.419> see<00:04:43.449> if<00:04:43.630> you

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
I'll unhook this thing we'll see if you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.540 
I'll unhook this thing we'll see if you
got<00:04:44.039> okay<00:04:45.039> then<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:46.139> uncoupled<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.550> it's

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
got okay then it's uncoupled and it's

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.189 
got okay then it's uncoupled and it's
got<00:04:48.759> more<00:04:48.970> weight<00:04:49.210> on<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.479> front<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.870> guys

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
got more weight on the front that guys

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.980 
got more weight on the front that guys
on<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.530> night<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:52.030> much<00:04:52.210> word<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.539> can't<00:04:52.780> lift

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
on the night so much word you can't lift

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.450 
on the night so much word you can't lift
it<00:04:53.759> like<00:04:54.759> if<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.000> wanted<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.300> pick<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.570> up

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.320 

I<00:04:59.410> can<00:05:00.410> not<00:05:01.130> tremendously<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.400> can<00:05:04.729> lift<00:05:05.150> it

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
I can not tremendously but I can lift it

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.700 
I can not tremendously but I can lift it
a<00:05:05.419> little<00:05:05.979> so<00:05:06.979> I<00:05:07.280> think<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:07.940> good<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.710> think

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
a little so I think that's good I think

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.280 
a little so I think that's good I think
that's<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:09.979> about<00:05:10.099> right
