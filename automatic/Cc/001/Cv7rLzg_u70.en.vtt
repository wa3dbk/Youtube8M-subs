00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello everyone in this video I want to show 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.590
 what i still bought in blacken and how i already 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.380
 spoke from spring of this year I time from 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.599
 time drove two pounds and and on 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.170
 scrap metal and there I was looking 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.439
 anvil or same rails besides 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 this bought home squares 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.560
 here let's say the front garden did the same 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 watched sore bearings and copan 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 valve you got from it such 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.460
 here are the smaller ones in about half a year i 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 drove into the first point of reception of scrap metal 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.960
 and the inspector told me that on the second 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 the point appeared to be like an anvil 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 a kilo hundred weights but I quickly 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.210
 gathered and went there to look at 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.789
 My windshield road is my car 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.170
 flew stone well and glass 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.239
 cracked when I arrived and saw 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.890
 who new 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.550
 I liked her immediately and all the more 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.550
 when I already paid 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.950
 bad mood broken glass immediately 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.900
 I have passed the purchase 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.460
 smoothed anvil 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:20.280
 broken glass in about a month I 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.049
 again drove to this receiving point 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 number two I came across this here 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.110
 rail and that is a piece of rail length 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:39.270
 it turns out 240 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.159
 height 180 at first I did not want to buy 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.850
 I think I have no one and why not 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.840
 rail but some time thought and decided 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.570
 it is not known yet when it will turn up 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.170
 It is this piece and I about a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.170
 so I decided to buy 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.140
 In addition to this, Terence still bought 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.240
 two bearing rings and in general this 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.560
 all things I threw on 13 kilograms 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.259
 from 15 rubles 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.670
 195 rubles I think it is no big 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:15.099
 money for which to bother 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.730
 and after a while I drove by 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.150
 first acceptance 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 scrap metal it turned up here these 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 here's the valve 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.690
 but since i'm a thrifty person this is the same 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.890
 not often come across just such 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.700
 the valves are big and from diesel I decided them 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.470
 to collect everything and in general bought together with 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.090
 valves I still bought this here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.050
 frame 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:49.400
 5 ampere meter that is, I already 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.750
 checked all she is in working condition not 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.840
 color is one project 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.470
 power unit unfinished maybe there 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.420
 I will use this and more 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.209
 all valves 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.700
 along with the rand of that ammeter pulled out 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.069
 me at 11 kilos but at that point in 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.790
 first sell me 10 rubles for 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.519
 kilogram and that it is 110 rubles 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.720
 pulled out I think it's a freebie at all 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:22.670
 the valve I checked everything magnetic 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.760
 completely stock and hats here it is 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 it turns out two kinds one more 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.560
 others are smaller and so understand tasteless 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.560
 other graduations 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:49.250

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.310
 and we crossed over with him in the fall 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.540
 The moment I have not had these 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.980

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:47.210

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.700
