a beautiful lens and the image quality
when<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.239> nails<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.840> stellar<00:04:14.410> from<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
when it nails it is stellar from the

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.740 
when it nails it is stellar from the
Fuji<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.400> when<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.940> nails<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.390> it's<00:04:16.539> also

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
Fuji and when this nails it it's also

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020 
Fuji and when this nails it it's also
quite<00:04:17.229> special<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.220> prefer<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.789> color

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
quite special so I prefer the color

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.630 
quite special so I prefer the color
coming<00:04:19.539> out<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> Fuji<00:04:20.200> lens<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:21.250> get<00:04:21.430> more

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
coming out of the Fuji lens you get more

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.730 
coming out of the Fuji lens you get more
of<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.820> Fuji<00:04:22.330> look<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.750> sometimes<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.560> notice

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
of that Fuji look and sometimes I notice

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.350 
of that Fuji look and sometimes I notice
the<00:04:23.979> color<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.370> little<00:04:24.490> dull<00:04:24.789> coming<00:04:25.180> out<00:04:25.270> of

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
the color is a little dull coming out of

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.570 
the color is a little dull coming out of
the<00:04:25.419> SLR<00:04:25.720> magic<00:04:26.050> lens<00:04:26.200> but<00:04:26.410> again<00:04:26.680> you're

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the SLR magic lens but again you're

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.810 
the SLR magic lens but again you're
looking<00:04:27.669> at<00:04:27.910> 279<00:04:28.539> versus<00:04:29.200> 550<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.789> a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
looking at 279 versus 550 this is a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.839 
looking at 279 versus 550 this is a
heavier<00:04:31.240> lens<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.840> feels<00:04:32.289> more<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.190> feels<00:04:33.610> more

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
heavier lens it feels more it feels more

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.790 
heavier lens it feels more it feels more
solid<00:04:34.120> than<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.630> Fuji<00:04:34.990> which<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.289> little<00:04:35.620> on

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
solid than the Fuji which is a little on

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.370 
solid than the Fuji which is a little on
the<00:04:35.919> light<00:04:36.130> side<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.240> Fuji<00:04:37.630> also<00:04:38.050> which

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
the light side but the Fuji also which

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.700 
the light side but the Fuji also which
love<00:04:38.680> has<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.580> manual<00:04:39.820> or<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.240> aperture

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
love has the manual or the aperture

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.870 
love has the manual or the aperture
manual<00:04:41.710> aperture<00:04:41.920> but<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.280> one<00:04:42.400> clicks<00:04:42.730> so

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
manual aperture but this one clicks so

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.630 
manual aperture but this one clicks so
you<00:04:42.940> know<00:04:43.150> when<00:04:43.330> you're<00:04:43.450> click<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> next

you know when you're click to the next
aperture<00:04:46.560> very<00:04:47.560> smooth<00:04:47.950> here<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:49.420> Fuji<00:04:49.810> can

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
aperture very smooth here the Fuji can

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.510 
aperture very smooth here the Fuji can
manually<00:04:50.560> focus<00:04:50.920> but<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.130> don't<00:04:51.310> really

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
manually focus but I don't really

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.210 
manually focus but I don't really
suggest<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.470> manually<00:04:53.470> focusing<00:04:53.980> on<00:04:54.190> a

suggest it and manually focusing on a
Fuji<00:04:54.640> body<00:04:54.850> is<00:04:54.970> not<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.270> best<00:04:55.450> experience

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080
