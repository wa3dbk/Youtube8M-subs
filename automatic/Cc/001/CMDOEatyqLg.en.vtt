00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 the deputy jair bolsonaro is his presence 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm going to finish my time, you talk a lot. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.880
 Greetings to me, Ambassador. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.780
 regretfully do not agree with the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 Most things that your excellence 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 hurt and patience can be happy with 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.500
 this is certainly question 2 in the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.019
 issue of Cubans 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.869
 I doubt any Argentine doctor 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 English Spanish topasse your salary 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.870
 was paid by his country in this gymkhana 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.969
 what pt proposed now 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 for fidel castro and fidel caf is the case 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.410
 of the Cuban government and in Haiti is a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.239
 will produce something on a scale 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 Industrial cubes produced as average 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.440
 had a market to sell and the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.100
 history of Cuba is the export of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.070
 ideologism such as the law of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 church of angola in the 70s as 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.080
 offered for the staff of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.189
 left in Brazil 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.630
 army men to guerrilla 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.310
 Araguaia that fidel castro would have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 logically by a democracy in our 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 parents 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 I see our president as a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.570
 person similar to the skirt hitler 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 I see this way so sensus 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.439
 present the truth the truth hurts 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 Ma'am and I want to get here at the conclusion. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 and the answer to your Excellency the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.189
 Sir, you respond democratically. 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 we still live a democracy is not for 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.659
 me a white dictatorship but we live in a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.299
 still democracy if I am right or 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.240
 not 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.579
 then the Cuban doctors on the scoreboard as 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 places and transports 12 roads 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 more than even a score 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.509
 what surprises here in the measure 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 that these doctors 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 threaten Cubans that it matters that the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.219
 government that only reaches large- scale 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.219
 huh 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.770
 they can bring all their 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.799
 legal dependents and they may 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.550
 to exercise paid status 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.090
 of work and social security karate 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.099
 the holder does not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.459
 but all dependents can be 10 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.170
 20 and 30 each we can have here until the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.120
 end because neither 70 and 80 thousand Cubans 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.280
 It's okay inside here now that I 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.450
 It is also surprising that aloísio 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.330
 merchant son of the general né 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.430
 he spoke right 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.660
 in the same unit that will launch the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.349
 program more teachers and in this 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.900
 Patota in this cattle coming and in trucks 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.720
 good to here surely the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.870
 direct dependents of Cubans will be 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 in schools where school books 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.690
 minister 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.690
 when the school books on file 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.900
 the first two and ovaries. 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:04.650
 preach nor to conclude that bin laden is 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 a right-wing politician 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.840
 part of them inspired come now 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.890
 dreams of a new society 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.560
 US accuses him of terrorism 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.880
 paulo césar's photo would make you say 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.780
 that he set up a grand scheme of 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.780
 corruption 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.019
 but the photo of the zé dirceu of the side he 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 just an example for your generation 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.840
 photo of the experienced cláudio melo saying 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.420
 that millions of Brazilians believed 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.099
 that cola would fight corruption a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.060
 lollipop so I'd say it was 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.630
 written below the photo lula arrived at 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.250
 Havana 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.069
 the most complete man of his time are 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.720
 dozens of pages an example of 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.459
 work from home to try to do the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.430
 homework after reading the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.959
 trough of tub on tub 59 as 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.190
 did when fidel castro ac second 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.500
 book as an end point in the dictatorship of 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.109
 fulgencio batista and for there the socialism 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.799
 that the theory of communism even says 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.319
 in the book here in the job is full and 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.669
 misery was swept under the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.269
 belly of that country 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.579
 the $ 20 a month they want that piece 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.709
 This disgrace works from home. 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.150
 I wanted to know if the ambassador was 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.570
 do a married job that I would write 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.840
 that does not match maximum power of the book 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.610
 do you agree that the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.730
 painters and murderers of political prisoners 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.020
 be executed after a revolution 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.889
 popular 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.699
 justifying the Cuban revolution that the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:47.139
 his people's court did so. 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:47.139
 December at least 17 million is 1900 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.900
 so I'm really concluding here 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.820
 so a socialist march and our country 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.100
 Where are you kidding at school? 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.990
 I'm talking about gay kit that does not that 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.860
 all books also teaching mothers 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.680
 were homosexual 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.889
 here they are teaching they would love 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.250
 socialism today capitalism prints 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.510
 hell and socialism is paradise this 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.430
 that is being taught by the kids 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.620
 who will have good support now from the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.830
 program more neighborhoods teachers 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.919
 marketplace about it complemented 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.350
 Your Excellency agrees with this book. 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.430
 we are on the way to a democracy 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.220
 where a socialism 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.110
 if the Cuban doctor - asked for asylum 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.479
 Your Excellency will grant the viper 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.430
 south portal mexico bank ask for asylum 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.690
 Brazil will grant or will deport it 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.610
 like the Cuban boxers only finally 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.039
 I do not intend to respond to provocations 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.200
 Mr Bolsonaro simply say and 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.880
 as a Brazilian citizen and chancellor 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.860
 I am deeply offended by the 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.060
 references of the themes that have been 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.190
 president of the republic who is 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.229
 entirely uncalled for, there is no 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.820
 democracy as ours and reveals 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.860
 including in my humble opinion the 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.520
 serious ignorance of the story 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.520
 thank you
