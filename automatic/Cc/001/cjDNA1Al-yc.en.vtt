00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome is a phase more gone 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.879
 transmitting useful and liverpool for the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 people expressing their net point in this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 opportunity as one of the three 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 natural advance pan on the tractor 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.769
 in that video we will take what is gray 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.099
 but do not stop checking it see more 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.099
 videos 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.720
 the living tells us visually where 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.540
 bring everything is recognizing where 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.910
 try is placing the grid to each bit 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.070
 on this street in this case as we have 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.279
 an electronic music song made 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.170
 on computer the beats are maintained 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.170
 constants for the whole song in this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.470
 case is the value of 125 and we see how the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.519
 cries located in those little networks 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.350
 white light socks is 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.059
 positioning both correctly on 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 in past songs you have to do 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 modifications and we make them with 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.870
 these four icons the first two 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 move the bid from left to right without 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.970
 affect the time of the song the two 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.120
 icons below if you move the tempo of the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.280
 song thus modifying the grip we are going to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.620
 An example 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.780
 let's go a little 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.040
 there is the grid we identify with this 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.070
 white developed icon 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.540
 with this icon we are going to move that 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.790
 continue left-right as I said without 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380
 affect the time then we see that it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.480
 is moving and commenting quite 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.520
 so that it is moving now 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.680
 we will continue to make movements or jumps 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.470
 bigger we keep the key 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.730
 controlled tight and it's going to move in 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 larger jumps 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.790
 let's return it as it was 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.530
 here and we take control and go in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.760
 portions 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.740
 smaller with the icons below what 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.270
 that we are going to do is modify the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.710
 song time tell you back 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.310
 for example because the song is not 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 125 but that other value and by doing this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.000
 we are also going to move the click then 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 the same happens we squeeze it we see how 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 time is moving and modifying 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.940
 the size of the hit is not displacing it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.989
 as a previous function just what 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.970
 is modifying the tempo we go back and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.530
 at the same time we did with the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.080
 control to move it we can 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.860
 maintain control for model 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.630
 investment in larger portions 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.690
 let's leave them there they were 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.840
 padlock obviously blocks all 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.490
 modification with the peak of the hearing aid 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.680
 we can 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.530
 and activate the metronome to be able 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.350
 listen and internal how is working 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.740
 the beat that we make this accessible 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.720
 first with the function of extending 2000 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.960
 be activated 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.960
 we activate the tic we go to preferences 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.410
 in the output 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.440
 we tell you that we do not want the exit in 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.270
 the master but the output on the monitor 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.060
 what we are going here and there it is already ringing 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.180
 that the beat 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.000
 now it is also important to have in the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.330
 mixed cropper check activated 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.270
 because by the signals by the signals 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.100
 of hearing aids is going specific 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.000
 come on, it's a second 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000
 if the law 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.980
 now recognized perfectly and that of 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.980
 the song 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.690
 and also the volume 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 and make the adjustments already with these four 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 pronounce themselves arrested 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.739
 yes 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.420
 maybe that also we thought as 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.420
 we were 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.600
 we are going to cars 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.600
 and then we put it on usher song 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.180
 if it's not placed on a monitor it's not going 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.549
 to sound the tic 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.180
 for next with this icon we place 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.259
 a big green you will not know where we were 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.259
 with a whole point 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.110
 to clouds are to do a little more 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.310
 specific more retail we place 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.020
 click 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.660
 now if you realize how we have 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.050
 placed a scream and we will not see that 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.540
 is not occupying a space here that is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.370
 because also within preferences in 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.040
 the option d 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.919
 analize options removed that check and 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.990
 says being pit market watch then what 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.910
 Leave in free space to be able to place 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.289
 some of the values â€‹â€‹that we have seen 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.000
 previously 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.510
 we close 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 we process shouting 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.320
 with the garbage icon we erase with the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.800
 auto again 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.950
 tractor and pass an analysis to the track and 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.630
 we automatically place the beats on 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.790
 reset not found any function 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.680
 that you with the manual and I do not know why 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.510
 is suddenly someone realize 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.850
 so that if you put it 10 of the 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.310
 note comments is obviously is 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.280
 to manually find the bpm the 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.740
 song so yes with those between 2 and by 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.060
 two and to multiply or divide the 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.950
 song time modifying well 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.410
 also the scream for example we are going to 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:44.810
 divide 125 between 260 and 2.5 500 and we see 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.940
 as also the scream has been modified 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.770
 for 255 for 250 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.600
 good gentlemen that has been all with 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.970
 regarding the green of the advanced panel in 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.710
 tractor forget us we decided to share 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.850
 that note and social networks facebook 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.710
 twitter and youtube 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.500
 likewise to the nominees do the 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.450
 comments within the note now yes
