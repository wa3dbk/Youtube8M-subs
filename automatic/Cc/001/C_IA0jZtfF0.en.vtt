 he took over the presidency of one of the 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.089
 largest Brazilian agencies 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.490
 of today it is with olive tree that despite 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.769
 young person has talent and experience of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.769
 left to command this operation 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.370
 Because it's people, that's why we're here. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.200
 on the lew lara tbwa then talk to him 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.030
 president of the olive martyr here 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.800
 the side that took office this 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.170
 agency since January this year only 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.180
 He's been here for 14 years. 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 practically made his whole career 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.000
 in this agency is a martyr and a good part of it 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.340
 because you and she are the account executive and 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.790
 I think the service since 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.520
 He always has a business role , right? 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.740
 because deep down he is representing 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.100
 a product a product that the product of the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 how the agency is thinking about 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 results the solutions for that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.350
 customer issues and he has 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.420
 to be this guy who knows and understands 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.670
 products to sell this product knows the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.160
 importance of that product has in life 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.170
 client business that you are 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.720
 from the beginning and you got that thing 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.080
 care planning director 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.030
 aretha everything divides today is completely 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.009
 different eventually these barriers fell 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.360
 two basic changes 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.850
 before you had a business that is a 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.740
 kind of a relay race, right? 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.440
 I was running like a baton at the time I 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.450
 I would give up the other I would stop running and 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 I was just going to see the complete 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.860
 today one race has everyone safe 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.050
 even enough and until the end because it is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.920
 integrated is there convergent not 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.920
 tv and now if other the face of creation 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.540
 he does not talk about business he does not talk about 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.100
 sales result he does not talk about the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.400
 marketing objective 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.489
 if he does not touch on that subject he'll turn 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.220
 artist at the client's head 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.320
 the artist does not want to know about my problem 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.640
 and that the guy at the desk does not have 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.980
 a creative insight 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.310
 if he does not think with the head of what 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 can make a difference does not come out if 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.530
 service is not stuck in the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.660
 creation dies 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.030
 so you need to have creative head 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.070
 have discretion and everything to be able to 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 know what you are seeing or do not leave 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.080
 Now let's talk a little bit about 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.910
 football and boating case surprise me 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.380
 I think amazing everyone said 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.320
 But the guys are getting to do it. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.660
 is in the midst of this crisis an entire brand 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.700
 I managed to win and fall into the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.130
 people that all part of the problem 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.900
 I'm not looking to sell meat I'm 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.080
 wanting to change a habit of changing a 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.490
 habit formed by persistence 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.530
 consistency and persistence 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.200
 You always have to hit the same key. 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.520
 the right way so the importance of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.020
 be believable 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.890
 why you have to have the person can 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.670
 trust what she is listening to and she hears 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.130
 frequency needs to be frequency 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.990
 choosing the tony branches is not picking 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.610
 anyone black only if the guy more 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.610
 incredible is a guy who does not do much 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.740
 advertising that we did not 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.440
 knows that he must have investigated the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.690
 whether or not to do and he did so 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.830
 this is an important choice the other is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.450
 what about us seems halfway 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.000
 very specific but people 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.640
 lose soft meat or red meat 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.290
 line or fresh meat and this has no 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.450
 nothing to do with meat quality 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.740
 deep down someone invented it one day and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.570
 not enough yet 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.160
 It's not enough, it has to have someone. 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.060
 seal why there mark on 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.420
 world right 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.820
 today is very curious after two 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.770
 waves in the two phases of the campaign 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.420
 people are asking people 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.070
 They are asking for football and people are 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.620
 so when speaking will buy 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.180
 people talk but it's friboi turned joke 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.430
 in the first moment another stone that 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.160
 never questioned that the meat must have 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.410
 quality when he was joking if this 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.600
 filezão woman asks if she efe 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.700
 even if it is a joke so're talking 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.290
 of the quality of it and is enjoying that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.930
 chat with the president of lew'lara 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.470

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.700
