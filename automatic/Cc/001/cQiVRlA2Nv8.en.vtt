00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 times 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.050
 yes of course it is very bitter that we 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.210
 after a 2 0-leadership still such a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 outstanding game so many chances 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 bremen had a clear grip on us only 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.450
 play a draw but it brings 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.009
 nothing we should not complain now 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.919
 have to try next week that yes 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.510
 to confirm the performance and then if 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.350
 it's in the best case times and away 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.260
 Get three when you see us like that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.440
 we played first half time 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 clearly the game clearly dominates 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.949
 They dominated one hand yes and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.420
 then 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.760
 We knew you at standards 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 strong we get the 1 1 or 2 1 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.059
 So I say that I to me 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 But one could support it now 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.039
 do nothing against it 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.510
 yes and then the 2 2 hits naturally 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.420
 the ball is world class and that reflects that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 a bit of the whole season again 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.870
 but still you can say again 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.930
 the first half was very good in 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.400
 well defended but only defended again 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 one point 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 very annoying we get 2 0 get 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 then stupid goal before half time 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.130
 but come from the half time really good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 again, our chances of a match will be right 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 then again at the standard not right 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 on at the second or third ball 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.469
 and then still have the front 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.030
 Chances to play the game over here 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.920
 to get over the goal 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 unfortunately we can not do that today 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.829
 that's why today, unfortunately, there are two 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.540
 lost points 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.670
 We are definitely great 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.590
 prepared exactly for bremen as well 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.039
 We also have to go to Freiburg next week 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 do 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.659
 It was a real step in the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.039
 the right direction and the point 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.469
 In any case, we like to take with you 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.149
 a shortfall of just under 15 minutes 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.700
 still held the 2 2 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 It was also a good reaction 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 had a few opportunities and we 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.270
 can only build on it now 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.359
 of course, already so unworthy man today 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359
 Well 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.050
 to do better in the next few weeks 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.540
 but at least we get there in the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.670
 scorching area at the moment and us 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.100
 have to implement now and the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.730
 chance to use and then I think goes 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.590
 it's uphill again 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.209
 We as a team have today as well 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.890
 shown again that we are playing 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.780
 we can play that out there 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.050
 You just have to do it now 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.060
 It's hugely important that we just take ours 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 creating opportunities to such a game then 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.050
 win and in freiburg we take 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.330
 run new name and want there too 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.250
 if possible then what about we have it 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.320
 rehearsed great that it worked 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.739
 but finally not to victory 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.840
 enough 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.860
 Of course, of course you have to 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.980
 account 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 werder wants to play europe we have it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.959
 today we have clear first half 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.670
 clearly better 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.330
 to the red card, too, I'll tell you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.819
 I say and of course you can do a lot there 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.930
 Of course, force does not pull out head 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.239
 Take it down and continue now 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.910
 Gap bremen was only above standards 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.489
 or high balls dangerous from the game 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.989
 the bremers have out or we have 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.470
 almost nothing allowed 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.700
 That's why we have to go from the bremen 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.560
 just be more focused 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.570
 even when the second since then choose the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.370
 again come down or the foot of the 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.430
 have that before that should not 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430
 happen
