00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello to all the boys of the clanio genius 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.049
 they are fusion well found in ours 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
 channel with this new video today are 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 returned here after about a week of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 inactivity with new mental this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.340
 because I've been busy enough 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'm doing this with school 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.859
 comments the school to me on June 6th 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 will end on June 9th so they are missing 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.219
 only two days and I am obliged to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.929
 to go there because to do two 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.479
 interrogations however leaving out 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.100
 this we talk about today's gameplay is 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.510
 was a gta deed for me 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.909
 I recommend pass by his channel that 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.609
 found in the description is precisely the 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.670
 gameplay is about a double nuclear 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:52.229
 done in only on domain recruit if not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.030
 I'm wrong with the Oscar h is 120 kg snow 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.069
 let us so it's really gameplay 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 very good considering the fact that su 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.329
 utah a is more difficult to play even in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 just because one often finds one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 basic as claymore snipers spread out in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 bottom of the map target locators 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.369
 and all these therefore hats off 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.799
 at the gameplay I recommend I already read it 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.689
 past his channel this is said 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.759
 let's move on to the topic of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.560
 today I decided to speak today 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.179
 a moment of our situation then 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 the situation of man towards him 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.469
 of the earth and the situation of the earth 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.799
 in relation to the universe therefore it is one 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.570
 sort of question of how much we are 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.429
 signifiers here is what we are 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.259
 signifier obviously indicates both 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.560
 the man who the earth because precisely 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.859
 I will talk about both points of view 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.799
 here then I thought this then 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.950
 the man in my opinion already on earth has 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.270
 lost at the start it is true it may have 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.770
 given great revolutions as technology 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.179
 all these things railways communication 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.409
 here, but thinking about it, we are the 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.969
 first we ruin ourselves because 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.810
 without realizing it 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.450
 let's pollute our planet it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.429
 we ruin with buildings that are 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.489
 they can safely avoid 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.780
 and all these things here and then I already have 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 said that the man lost at the start 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.690
 with the earth 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.220
 that already against natural phenomena not 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.860
 we can do nothing about natural phenomena 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.629
 understood as I do not know earthquakes and tsunamis 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.500
 winds the rain really there 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.209
 annoys a lot I 'm not talking 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.319
 a moment of earthquakes 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.090
 yes we can start predicting them and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.910
 avoid quotes in defeats 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 on the part of our planet however it is a lot 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.459
 I think it is a very process 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.380
 difficult that will be working let's say 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 so in quite a few years anyway a 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.920
 apparently there is someone who has 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.459
 going to design something that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.829
 precisely it allows us to perceive in 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.660
 advance precisely the manifests the 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.700
 excuse me of this kind 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.629
 of event is boys instead I thought 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.180
 as for the land in the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.549
 comparisons of the universe that we 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.260
 basically this is nothing 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.450
 because then we are in a galaxy 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.470
 our galaxy is called the Milky Way 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.030
 it is the earth as you all know it is not 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.019
 the only planet 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.459
 within this galaxy there is 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.209
 they are many others now I do not 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.280
 I remind everyone how mars saturn all 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.750
 these then there are the satellites is the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.370
 main star within the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.930
 which all these planets rotate 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.430
 precisely the sun taking in 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.349
 therefore consider the sun the earth 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.840
 it may very well be noted that the earth is 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.959
 smaller than the sun 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.849
 so it's already a point against 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.440
 ours because the earth being more 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.880
 small compared to the sun will do of 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.169
 Consequently smaller than 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.430
 other planets that are in ours 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.989
 galaxy 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.630
 in our galaxy guys we are the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 unique there is the earth is the only planet 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.599
 where precisely there are forms of life 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.609
 apparently still thinking a 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.650
 moment to the milky way towards 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.669
 we know about the whole universe 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.239
 that there are several galaxies that 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.560
 surely they will host certain 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.900
 life forms now I do not say that 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.269
 are the years because I do not believe that is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.769
 a stupid thing the alien would be a 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.430
 ends in my opinion to indicate the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.400
 strange or otherwise I don't think they are 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.590
 populated by those green men that we 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.389
 we are around here, however, surely 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.630
 there are other forms of life there 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.430
 are many other planets ones 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.500
 things that we are going to say, oh well 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.930
 we have seen google and trust you 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.810
 they are all crap second is from at least 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.389
 My point of view are stupid things 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.100
 to which one must not believe 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.570
 so guys since this gameplay 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.190
 is coming to an end 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.050
 I invite you as always to leave a beautiful 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.759
 I like a comment to subscribe to 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.620
 channel if you are not yet 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.120
 I hope I have treated this well 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100
 argument however is a commentary 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.720
 I have tried quite a lot of it 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.940
 so once I hope it has come 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.370
 well if there are any peculiarities i 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.470
 excuse the verbs for some whole term 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.510
 however we see to reach 500 mi 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.510
 like a greeting to the escape hello everyone 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:23.860
 pg and tf we boast mass to do 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.860
 I reach the past few years
