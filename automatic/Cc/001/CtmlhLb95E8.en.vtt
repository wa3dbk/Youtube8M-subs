00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.990 
the original you see that the hood that
you<00:04:29.270> can<00:04:29.449> it<00:04:29.750> comes<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> air<00:04:30.229> comes<00:04:30.530> off<00:04:30.710> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
you can it comes the air comes off the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.800 
you can it comes the air comes off the
off<00:04:32.000> into<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.479> right<00:04:33.350> there<00:04:34.220> yep<00:04:34.810> great

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
off into that right there yep great

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.860 
off into that right there yep great
you're<00:04:35.990> telling<00:04:36.260> me<00:04:36.289> that's<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:37.449> manifold<00:04:38.449> and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
you're telling me that's a manifold and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.750 
you're telling me that's a manifold and
it<00:04:39.050> says<00:04:39.289> Oldsmobile<00:04:39.970> W<00:04:40.970> 350<00:04:41.630> on<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.169> W

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
it says Oldsmobile W 350 on that the W

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.719 
it says Oldsmobile W 350 on that the W
31<00:04:43.760> has<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.199> W<00:04:45.530> 30<00:04:45.800> were<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.280> only<00:04:46.460> two

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
31 has in the W 30 were the only two

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.939 
31 has in the W 30 were the only two
engines<00:04:47.720> with<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.080> little<00:04:48.350> bit<00:04:48.500> manifold

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
engines with it a little bit manifold

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.110 
engines with it a little bit manifold
okay

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
okay

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.779 
okay
the<00:04:50.449> engine<00:04:50.780> also<00:04:50.990> has<00:04:51.199> very<00:04:51.949> big<00:04:52.160> valves<00:04:52.490> in

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
the engine also has very big valves in

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.420 
the engine also has very big valves in
it<00:04:52.910> it's<00:04:53.120> got<00:04:54.010> 455<00:04:56.260> cubic-inch<00:04:57.260> engine<00:04:57.770> valves

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
it it's got 455 cubic-inch engine valves

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.330 
it it's got 455 cubic-inch engine valves
that<00:04:58.580> are<00:04:58.760> in<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.240> heads<00:04:59.449> so<00:05:00.320> they're<00:05:00.500> bigger

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
that are in the heads so they're bigger

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.339 
that are in the heads so they're bigger
heads<00:05:01.669> bigger<00:05:02.120> valves<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:03.169> got<00:05:03.320> a

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
heads bigger valves and it's got a

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.550 
heads bigger valves and it's got a
special<00:05:03.650> harmonic<00:05:04.310> balancer<00:05:04.760> on<00:05:04.960> in<00:05:05.960> both<00:05:06.289> the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
special harmonic balancer on in both the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.150 
special harmonic balancer on in both the
w<00:05:06.889> 31<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.639> w<00:05:07.970> 30<00:05:08.240> were<00:05:09.099> kind<00:05:10.099> of

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
w 31 and the w 30 were kind of

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.060 
w 31 and the w 30 were kind of
equivalent<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:11.169> blueprinted<00:05:12.169> engines<00:05:12.590> where

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
equivalent to blueprinted engines where

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.280 
equivalent to blueprinted engines where
the<00:05:13.310> tolerances<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.180> everything<00:05:14.539> were

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
the tolerances and everything were

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.170 
the tolerances and everything were
or<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.680> double<00:05:16.040> check<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.580> looks<00:05:16.760> great<00:05:17.030> well

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
or a double check it looks great well

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.730 
or a double check it looks great well
let's<00:05:17.210> shut<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.780> hood<00:05:17.930> stand<00:05:18.410> next<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.650> your

let's shut the hood stand next to your

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:28.579 
let's shut the hood stand next to your
car

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.120 

stay<00:05:29.159> right<00:05:29.279> next<00:05:29.369> to<00:05:29.519> a<00:05:29.579> damn

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.780 

damn<00:05:32.670> face<00:05:32.940> being<00:05:33.150> on<00:05:33.240> my<00:05:33.330> car<00:05:33.540> story
