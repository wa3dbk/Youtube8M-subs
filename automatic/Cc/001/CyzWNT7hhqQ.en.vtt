00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.550
 this year there has been a lot of level 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.470
 about seven Africans more or less than 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.260
 they had some records below 112 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.790
 and well, I knew I was 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.710
 training well I knew I could do 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.440
 good brand had to trust me and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.210
 to leave very determined not in this case 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.370
 Well, I'm happy with the brand and 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.990
 well I think that the preparation facing the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.820
 marathon to the spanish championship of san 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.750
 Sebastian, it's going well ahead 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.310
 so then I'm left with that record 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.160
 the worst thing that takes a little bit is the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.690
 humidity but good we already know that when 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.890
 So we come here for the Mediterranean 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.650
 but we can always suffer from that is not 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.530
 a test the truth is wonderful the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.450
 people very involved in the test from the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.490
 beginning to the end and well then 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.560
 for charged for always take care of us very 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.560
 good to the athletes and well I'm 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.460
 delighted, I think so, because 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.150
 good organization 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.610
 and well, I think that in marathons 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.190
 from abroad and so they do not have 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.070
 not much difference with here has not 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.590
 there were 10 thousand 500 participants and good 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.240
 I think you can position yourself as one of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.240
 the best half marathons in Spain
