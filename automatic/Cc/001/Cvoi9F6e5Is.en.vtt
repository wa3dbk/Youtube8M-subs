and clean and so I got these flowers
stencils<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.710> one<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:52.920> happen<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> have

a<00:00:54.649> nice<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.890> border<00:00:56.340> design<00:00:56.699> along<00:00:57.180> here

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
a nice little border design along here

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.209 
a nice little border design along here
so<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> used<00:00:58.559> along<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> side

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so that's what I used along the side

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.160 
so that's what I used along the side
there<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.379> then<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.719> painted<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:05.750> vine<00:01:06.750> just

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
there and then I painted a vine just

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.390 
there and then I painted a vine just
freehand<00:01:07.760> with<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> brush<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.619> used

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
freehand with a brush and then just used

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.140 
freehand with a brush and then just used
the<00:01:11.729> lighter<00:01:11.939> color<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> went<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the lighter color and then I went to the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
the lighter color and then I went to the
darker<00:01:15.540> color<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:17.009> accent<00:01:17.490> along

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
darker color as a little accent along
the<00:01:18.180> line<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.780> pretty<00:01:19.380> easy

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the line there and that's pretty easy

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
the line there and that's pretty easy
and<00:01:19.860> simple<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.210> you're<00:01:21.330> not

four feet and then make sure you line it
up<00:02:37.810> with<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.830> exactly<00:02:39.370> where<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.610> is

if you want to I personally I would

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.850 
if you want to I personally I would
probably<00:02:48.430> use<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.420> marker<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.959> do<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.350> instead

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.830 
of painting everything but if you want

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.460 
have a little bit of leaking around the
edges<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.660> lines<00:03:16.900> aren't<00:03:17.140> quite<00:03:17.350> as

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470

crisp<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.120> pretty<00:03:19.330> easy<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:20.019> go

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
crisp and that is pretty easy to just go

crisp and that is pretty easy to just go
in<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.670> brush<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.640> want<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.030> get<00:03:25.209> a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
end there and then just come in here and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.000 
end there and then just come in here and
clean<00:03:37.450> your<00:03:37.630> edges<00:03:37.959> up<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.470> little<00:03:38.500> bit

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
clean your edges up just a little bit

clean your edges up just a little bit
with<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> brush<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.820> don't<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.360> that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
with a brush you don't have to be that

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.060 
with a brush you don't have to be that
good<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.170> brush<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:43.150> do<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.600> or<00:03:44.230> if<00:03:44.890> you

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
good with the brush to do that or if you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.949 
good with the brush to do that or if you
don't<00:03:45.190> mind<00:03:45.549> having<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.299> little<00:03:46.420> bit<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.660> bleed

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
don't mind having a little bit of bleed

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.130 
don't mind having a little bit of bleed
around<00:03:47.170> your<00:03:47.440> stencils<00:03:48.630> it's<00:03:49.630> not<00:03:49.900> really

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
around your stencils it's not really

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
around your stencils it's not really
that<00:03:50.290> big<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.650> deal

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
that big of a deal

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.759 
that big of a deal
it<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.760> depends<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.299> what<00:03:52.570> your<00:03:53.019> end<00:03:53.230> goal<00:03:53.470> is

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
it just depends on what your end goal is

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.750 
it just depends on what your end goal is
and<00:03:54.010> how<00:03:54.690> crisp<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.019> clean<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.950> want<00:03:57.220> your

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and how crisp and clean you want your

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.970 
and how crisp and clean you want your
lines<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.930> be<00:04:01.200> clean<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.440> up<00:04:02.470> just<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.950> little

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
lines to be clean that up just a little

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.950 
lines to be clean that up just a little
bit<00:04:03.250> there

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.950 

and<00:04:09.310> actually<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.240> things<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.660> I

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
and actually one of the things that I

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.370 
and actually one of the things that I
always<00:04:12.440> recommend<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:13.010> practice<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.810> if<00:04:15.170> you

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
always recommend is practice so if you

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.300 
always recommend is practice so if you
just<00:04:15.590> practice<00:04:15.830> doing<00:04:16.430> your<00:04:16.579> stenciling<00:04:17.180> on<00:04:17.480> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
just practice doing your stenciling on a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.979 
just practice doing your stenciling on a
piece<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.430> paper<00:04:19.609> before<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.150> put<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.750> on<00:04:20.840> your

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
piece of paper before you put it on your

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.230 
piece of paper before you put it on your
actual<00:04:21.290> project<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:24.400> will<00:04:25.400> know<00:04:25.580> exactly<00:04:25.700> how

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
actual project you will know exactly how

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.010

your<00:04:26.450> paint<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.020> your<00:04:27.970> tools<00:04:28.970> brushes<00:04:29.570> are

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
your paint and your tools brushes are

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.940 
your paint and your tools brushes are
going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:31.450> behave<00:04:32.450> it's<00:04:33.260> got<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.470> little<00:04:33.710> bit<00:04:33.830> of

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
going to behave it's got a little bit of

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.310 
going to behave it's got a little bit of
bleed<00:04:34.130> over<00:04:34.310> there<00:04:37.960> anyways<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.169> is<00:04:39.200> a

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
bleed over there anyways that is a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.040 
bleed over there anyways that is a
simple<00:04:39.740> way<00:04:39.860> for<00:04:39.890> you<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.280> clean<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:40.730> so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
simple way for you to clean it up so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.070 
simple way for you to clean it up so
that<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:43.520> how<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.910> paint<00:04:44.330> your<00:04:44.570> own<00:04:44.720> growth
