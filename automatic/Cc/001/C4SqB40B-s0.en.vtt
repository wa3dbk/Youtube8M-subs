now<00:00:09.879> that<00:00:10.030> you<00:00:10.120> know<00:00:10.209> how<00:00:10.330> to<00:00:10.360> render<00:00:10.719> scene

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
now that you know how to render scene

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.650 
now that you know how to render scene
let's<00:00:11.830> go<00:00:11.949> ahead<00:00:12.039> and<00:00:12.250> look<00:00:12.309> at<00:00:12.459> how<00:00:12.610> to<00:00:12.669> change

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
let's go ahead and look at how to change

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.409 
let's go ahead and look at how to change
how<00:00:14.049> that<00:00:14.109> scene<00:00:14.529> looks<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:15.250> this<00:00:16.059> is<00:00:16.209> done

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:16.419 
how that scene looks and this is done

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.929 
how that scene looks and this is done
primarily<00:00:17.080> through<00:00:17.380> lighting<00:00:17.650> I<00:00:18.009> reference

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
primarily through lighting I reference

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.150 
primarily through lighting I reference
the<00:00:19.119> lamp<00:00:19.329> object<00:00:19.810> multiple<00:00:20.410> times<00:00:20.680> which<00:00:21.009> you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
the lamp object multiple times which you

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.580 
the lamp object multiple times which you
can<00:00:21.279> be<00:00:21.369> which<00:00:21.699> can<00:00:21.849> be<00:00:21.939> found<00:00:22.119> here<00:00:22.630> now

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
can be which can be found here now

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.409 
can be which can be found here now
currently<00:00:23.980> if<00:00:24.220> we<00:00:24.430> view<00:00:24.669> it<00:00:24.759> from<00:00:24.880> top<00:00:25.150> view

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
currently if we view it from top view

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.389 
currently if we view it from top view
you<00:00:25.599> can<00:00:25.840> see<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.079> lamp<00:00:26.379> is<00:00:26.559> on<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.800> top<00:00:27.040> right

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399 
you can see the lamp is on the top right

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.389 
you can see the lamp is on the top right
side<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:28.090> our<00:00:28.840> object<00:00:29.290> here<00:00:29.619> we<00:00:30.070> can<00:00:30.189> see<00:00:30.309> this

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
side of our object here we can see this

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.740 
side of our object here we can see this
more<00:00:30.460> clearly<00:00:30.610> if<00:00:30.969> we<00:00:31.000> switch<00:00:31.239> to<00:00:31.390> camera<00:00:31.599> view

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
more clearly if we switch to camera view

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.920 
more clearly if we switch to camera view
by<00:00:32.410> hitting<00:00:32.619> zero<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.219> our<00:00:33.250> number<00:00:33.579> pad<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.090> if

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
by hitting zero on our number pad and if

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.410 
by hitting zero on our number pad and if
you<00:00:35.050> hit<00:00:35.200> render<00:00:35.500> on<00:00:35.770> render<00:00:36.460> image<00:00:36.820> you'll

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
you hit render on render image you'll

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.810 
you hit render on render image you'll
see<00:00:37.510> how<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.050> lit<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:39.340> let's<00:00:39.460> go<00:00:39.579> ahead<00:00:39.640> and

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
see how it's lit well let's go ahead and

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.459 
see how it's lit well let's go ahead and
move<00:00:39.910> that<00:00:39.940> light<00:00:40.329> around<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.930> see<00:00:41.230> how<00:00:41.410> that

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
move that light around and see how that

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.280 
move that light around and see how that
affects<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.790> from<00:00:43.030> top<00:00:43.180> view<00:00:43.480> perhaps<00:00:43.870> just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
affects it so from top view perhaps just

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.260 
affects it so from top view perhaps just
hit<00:00:44.680> G<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.310> move<00:00:45.460> your<00:00:45.640> lamp<00:00:45.820> while<00:00:46.060> it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
hit G to move your lamp while it's

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.240 
hit G to move your lamp while it's
selected<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.780> move<00:00:47.380> it<00:00:47.560> over<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.040> left

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
selected and move it over to the left

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.100 
selected and move it over to the left
side<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.670> camera<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.180> then<00:00:49.720> hit<00:00:49.899> render

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
side of the camera and then hit render

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.040 
side of the camera and then hit render
and<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.489> can<00:00:51.610> see<00:00:51.820> how<00:00:52.239> it's<00:00:52.420> adjusted<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
and you can see how it's adjusted the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.040 
and you can see how it's adjusted the
lighting<00:00:53.320> effects<00:00:53.649> but<00:00:54.610> what<00:00:54.790> if<00:00:54.940> like<00:00:55.210> any

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
lighting effects but what if like any

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.110 
lighting effects but what if like any
like<00:00:56.290> a<00:00:56.410> mesh<00:00:56.920> object<00:00:57.100> we<00:00:57.579> go<00:00:57.730> ahead<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:57.940> hit

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
like a mesh object we go ahead and hit

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.180 
like a mesh object we go ahead and hit
shift<00:00:58.420> D<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:59.110> duplicate<00:00:59.559> that<00:00:59.739> lamp<00:00:59.980> and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
shift D to duplicate that lamp and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.240 
shift D to duplicate that lamp and
you'll<00:01:01.059> now<00:01:01.210> see<00:01:01.380> that<00:01:02.380> it's<00:01:02.530> being<00:01:02.680> lit<00:01:02.920> from

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
you'll now see that it's being lit from

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.369 
you'll now see that it's being lit from
both<00:01:03.489> sides<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.689> you<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:04.899> change<00:01:05.170> the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
both sides and so you can change the

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.770 
both sides and so you can change the
lighting<00:01:05.619> any<00:01:05.979> way<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.399> you<00:01:06.520> want<00:01:06.780> however

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
lighting any way that you want however

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.840 
lighting any way that you want however
there's<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.500> lot<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.740> different<00:01:08.979> side<00:01:09.159> settings

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
there's a lot of different side settings

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.280 
there's a lot of different side settings
within<00:01:10.149> these<00:01:10.299> lamps<00:01:10.689> that<00:01:10.719> we<00:01:10.899> can<00:01:11.020> modify

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
within these lamps that we can modify

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.099 
within these lamps that we can modify
and<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:12.579> can<00:01:12.700> access<00:01:13.030> these<00:01:13.210> settings<00:01:13.630> by

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
and you can access these settings by

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.999 
and you can access these settings by
going<00:01:14.139> over<00:01:14.469> to<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:14.979> lamp<00:01:15.189> properties<00:01:15.759> here

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going over to the lamp properties here

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.190 
going over to the lamp properties here
first<00:01:18.009> off<00:01:18.189> you<00:01:18.369> can<00:01:18.490> see<00:01:18.670> your<00:01:18.880> preview<00:01:19.389> right

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
first off you can see your preview right

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.139 
first off you can see your preview right
here<00:01:20.259> which<00:01:20.649> shows<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.490> fairly

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
here which shows that it's a fairly

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.120 
here which shows that it's a fairly
bright<00:01:22.420> lamp<00:01:22.719> or<00:01:22.869> fairly<00:01:23.020> soft<00:01:23.380> lamp<00:01:23.709> actually

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
bright lamp or fairly soft lamp actually

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.819 
bright lamp or fairly soft lamp actually
it's<00:01:24.369> using<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.329> point<00:01:25.689> lamp<00:01:25.929> type<00:01:26.289> and<00:01:26.529> then

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
it's using the point lamp type and then

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's using the point lamp type and then
you<00:01:26.979> can<00:01:27.130> change<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.579> to<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.759> Sun<00:01:28.270> SPOT<00:01:28.899> Hemi

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
you can change that to a Sun SPOT Hemi

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.590 
you can change that to a Sun SPOT Hemi
or<00:01:29.590> area<00:01:29.950> which<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.609> won't<00:01:30.789> talk<00:01:31.029> about<00:01:31.060> for<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
or area which I won't talk about for the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.260 
or area which I won't talk about for the
time<00:01:31.779> being<00:01:32.249> but<00:01:33.249> you<00:01:33.340> can<00:01:33.459> also<00:01:33.579> change<00:01:33.909> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
time being but you can also change the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.660 
time being but you can also change the
lamp<00:01:34.810> color<00:01:35.109> so<00:01:35.679> perhaps<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.219> is<00:01:36.369> going<00:01:36.579> to

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
lamp color so perhaps this is going to

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.969 
lamp color so perhaps this is going to
be<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.819> blue<00:01:37.209> lamp<00:01:37.479> we<00:01:38.349> can<00:01:38.469> tell<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.799> be<00:01:38.859> a

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
be a blue lamp we can tell it to be a

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.709 
be a blue lamp we can tell it to be a
negative<00:01:39.279> such<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.849> it<00:01:39.939> takes<00:01:40.149> away<00:01:40.450> light

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
negative such that it takes away light

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.870 
negative such that it takes away light
we<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.499> tell<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.709> to<00:01:41.740> affect<00:01:42.039> only<00:01:42.159> this<00:01:42.609> one

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
we can tell it to affect only this one

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.730 
we can tell it to affect only this one
layer<00:01:43.119> within<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.599> 3d<00:01:43.840> view<00:01:44.139> which<00:01:44.469> I've<00:01:44.619> not

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.800 
layer within the 3d view which I've not
covered<00:01:45.159> but<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.399> can<00:01:45.579> find<00:01:45.880> through<00:01:46.389> here

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
covered but you can find through here

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.569

allows<00:01:47.319> you<00:01:47.469> to<00:01:47.560> work<00:01:47.709> with<00:01:47.740> layers<00:01:48.039> much<00:01:48.399> like

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
allows you to work with layers much like

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.669 
allows you to work with layers much like
Photoshop<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:50.020> can<00:01:50.109> tell<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.319> whether<00:01:50.469> to

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
Photoshop you can tell it whether to

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.499 
Photoshop you can tell it whether to
affect<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.189> specular<00:01:51.729> or<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.149> shininess

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
affect the specular or the shininess

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.800 
affect the specular or the shininess
value<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.229> your<00:01:53.679> model<00:01:54.069> or<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:55.060> diffuse<00:01:55.450> to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
value of your model or the diffuse to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.669 
value of your model or the diffuse to
affect<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.289> coloring<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:56.889> the<00:01:57.099> lighting<00:01:57.340> and

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
affect the coloring or the lighting and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.529 
affect the coloring or the lighting and
there's<00:01:59.679> your<00:02:00.130> fair<00:02:00.819> view<00:02:01.029> other<00:02:01.179> settings

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
there's your fair view other settings

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.730 
there's your fair view other settings
but<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.749> primary<00:02:01.990> one<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.469> will<00:02:02.560> look

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
but the primary one that you will look

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.279 
but the primary one that you will look
at<00:02:02.919> are<00:02:03.279> the<00:02:03.429> color<00:02:03.669> and<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.149> energy<00:02:04.539> let's

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
at are the color and the energy let's

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.620 
at are the color and the energy let's
perhaps<00:02:05.649> turn<00:02:05.919> this<00:02:06.069> energy<00:02:06.429> down<00:02:06.669> and<00:02:06.969> we've

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
perhaps turn this energy down and we've

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.139 
perhaps turn this energy down and we've
changed<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:08.349> blue<00:02:08.649> color<00:02:08.920> which<00:02:09.729> then<00:02:09.940> if

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
changed it to a blue color which then if

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.420 
changed it to a blue color which then if
we<00:02:10.270> go<00:02:10.420> over<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.630> hit<00:02:10.959> render<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.069> see<00:02:12.250> how

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
we go over and hit render we can see how

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.370 
we go over and hit render we can see how
that's<00:02:12.640> affecting<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.900> mostly<00:02:14.200> being

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that's affecting it so it's mostly being

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.600 
that's affecting it so it's mostly being
affected<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.010> side<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.459> can<00:02:15.580> see

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
affected on this side and you can see

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.180 
affected on this side and you can see
it's<00:02:15.819> bleeding<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> little<00:02:16.660> bit<00:02:16.780> there

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's bleeding over a little bit there

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.250 
it's bleeding over a little bit there
perhaps<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.430> move<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.660> over<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.170> little

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
perhaps if we move this over a little

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.820 
perhaps if we move this over a little
more<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.860> top

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
more to the top

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.280 
more to the top
and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.160> hit<00:02:22.340> render<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> it's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and then hit render we can see that it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.620 
and then hit render we can see that it's
having<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.530> bit<00:02:24.680> more<00:02:24.860> effect<00:02:25.160> there<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:26.540> can

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
having a bit more effect there we can

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.270 
having a bit more effect there we can
change<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:27.050> lamp<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.560> any<00:02:27.740> color<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.190> we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
change this lamp to any color that we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.010 
change this lamp to any color that we
want<00:02:28.430> or<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.450> leave<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.690> at<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> default

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
want or we can leave it at the default

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.230 
want or we can leave it at the default
anything<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.130> wish<00:02:31.280> perhaps<00:02:32.000> will

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
anything that we wish perhaps will

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.840 
anything that we wish perhaps will
increase<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> energy<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.850> then

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
increase the energy on it and then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.960 
increase the energy on it and then
decrease<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.480> energy<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.110> one<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.970> then

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
decrease the energy on this one and then

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.150 
decrease the energy on this one and then
hit<00:02:38.090> render<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.200> also<00:02:39.320> have<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> shortcut

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
hit render you can also have a shortcut

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.310 
hit render you can also have a shortcut
key<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.490> render<00:02:40.850> by<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.210> hitting<00:02:41.360> f5<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.290> your

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
key to render by just hitting f5 on your

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.400 
key to render by just hitting f5 on your
keyboard<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:44.360> these<00:02:44.480> are<00:02:44.630> very<00:02:44.780> very<00:02:44.930> simple

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
keyboard so these are very very simple

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.130 
keyboard so these are very very simple
lamps<00:02:45.800> well<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:47.150> about<00:02:47.240> if<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.570> want<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.870> add

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
lamps well what about if we want to add

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
lamps well what about if we want to add
a<00:02:48.170> new<00:02:48.470> lamp<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.490> duplicate

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
a new lamp you know we can duplicate

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.120 
a new lamp you know we can duplicate
lamps<00:02:50.360> any<00:02:50.510> way<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:50.870> want<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.680> maybe<00:02:51.950> we

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
lamps any way that we want but maybe we

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.810 
lamps any way that we want but maybe we
don't<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.580> worry<00:02:52.730> about

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
don't want to have to worry about

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.490 
don't want to have to worry about
changing<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.480> settings<00:02:53.900> over<00:02:54.140> or<00:02:54.380> we

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
changing all the settings over or we

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.530 
changing all the settings over or we
want<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.710> keep<00:02:54.830> these<00:02:55.040> settings<00:02:55.400> well<00:02:56.210> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
want to keep these settings well just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.060 
want to keep these settings well just
like<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.810> can<00:02:56.960> add<00:02:57.080> mesh<00:02:57.320> objects<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:57.950> can

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
like you can add mesh objects you can

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.670 
like you can add mesh objects you can
hit<00:02:58.160> shift<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:59.030> add<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> lamp<00:02:59.510> object<00:02:59.990> here

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
hit shift a to add a lamp object here

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.190 
hit shift a to add a lamp object here
yeah<00:03:01.130> here<00:03:01.550> which<00:03:02.150> then<00:03:02.270> allows<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.900> set

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
yeah here which then allows you to set

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500 
yeah here which then allows you to set
it<00:03:03.230> with<00:03:03.800> any<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.280> default<00:03:04.970> settings<00:03:05.090> such

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
it with any of the default settings such

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.130 
it with any of the default settings such
as<00:03:05.540> an<00:03:05.720> area<00:03:06.020> Hemi<00:03:06.590> spot<00:03:07.370> or<00:03:07.640> Sun<00:03:08.050> let's<00:03:09.050> go

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
as an area Hemi spot or Sun let's go

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.740 
as an area Hemi spot or Sun let's go
ahead<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.530> add<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.710> Sun<00:03:10.130> lamp<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.750> we'll

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
ahead and just add a Sun lamp and we'll

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.870 
ahead and just add a Sun lamp and we'll
move<00:03:11.990> it<00:03:12.110> over<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.560> then<00:03:13.250> perhaps<00:03:13.400> from<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
move it over and then perhaps from the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.560 
move it over and then perhaps from the
front<00:03:14.120> view<00:03:14.650> we'll<00:03:15.650> rotate<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.480> move<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
front view we'll rotate it and move it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.530 
front view we'll rotate it and move it
up<00:03:17.690> from<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.560> side<00:03:18.770> view<00:03:19.040> or<00:03:19.610> top<00:03:19.940> view<00:03:20.120> we'll

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
up from the side view or top view we'll

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.660 
up from the side view or top view we'll
rotate<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:21.110> around<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:22.550> not

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
rotate it around so that it's not

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.850 
rotate it around so that it's not
pointing<00:03:23.060> directly<00:03:23.210> at<00:03:23.570> our<00:03:23.780> object<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.380> if

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
pointing directly at our object and if

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.320 
pointing directly at our object and if
we<00:03:24.980> hit<00:03:25.070> f12<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:25.760> can<00:03:25.880> see<00:03:26.030> how<00:03:26.150> that's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
we hit f12 we can see how that's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.120 
we hit f12 we can see how that's
affecting<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.380> can<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:27.650> it's<00:03:27.770> very<00:03:27.800> very

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
affecting it you can see it's very very

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.949 
affecting it you can see it's very very
bright

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
bright

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.880 
bright
that's<00:03:29.959> very<00:03:30.110> cool<00:03:30.290> let's<00:03:30.500> go<00:03:30.560> ahead<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
that's very cool let's go ahead and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.880 
that's very cool let's go ahead and
delete<00:03:31.010> our<00:03:31.690> blue<00:03:32.690> lamp<00:03:32.930> by<00:03:33.350> selecting<00:03:33.800> it

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
delete our blue lamp by selecting it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.920 
delete our blue lamp by selecting it
with<00:03:33.980> right<00:03:34.190> mouse<00:03:34.370> button<00:03:34.700> hit<00:03:35.120> X<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.660> delete

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
with right mouse button hit X and delete

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.680 
with right mouse button hit X and delete
vertices<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:36.620> delete<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:38.330> we<00:03:38.420> can<00:03:38.570> maybe

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
vertices or delete and then we can maybe

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.660 
vertices or delete and then we can maybe
move<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.590> over<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:40.070> get<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.430> bit<00:03:40.550> more

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
move this over to get a little bit more

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.360 
move this over to get a little bit more
of<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.030> backlighting<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.709> then<00:03:42.890> hit<00:03:43.040> f12

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
of a backlighting to it and then hit f12

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.820 
of a backlighting to it and then hit f12
and<00:03:43.730> see<00:03:44.150> how<00:03:44.239> it's<00:03:44.390> looking<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.680> very

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
and see how it's looking so this is very

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.010 
and see how it's looking so this is very
cool<00:03:46.160> perhaps<00:03:46.550> we'll<00:03:46.790> rotate<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.360> around<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
cool perhaps we'll rotate this around a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.660 
cool perhaps we'll rotate this around a
bit<00:03:48.380> more<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:50.170> turn<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> energy<00:03:51.470> down<00:03:51.860> just<00:03:52.580> a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
bit more and turn the energy down just a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.330 
bit more and turn the energy down just a
little<00:03:52.970> bit<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.330> it's<00:03:53.450> not<00:03:53.540> quite<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:53.840> bright

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
little bit so it's not quite so bright

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.470 
little bit so it's not quite so bright
so<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.550> see<00:03:55.700> how<00:03:55.880> plain<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
so you can see how plain with the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.870 
so you can see how plain with the
lighting<00:03:56.810> allows<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.590> modify<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.640> way

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
lighting allows you to modify the way

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.240 
lighting allows you to modify the way
that<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.150> scene<00:03:59.360> looks<00:03:59.660> just<00:04:00.230> like<00:04:00.470> adjusting

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
that the scene looks just like adjusting

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.070 
that the scene looks just like adjusting
the<00:04:01.370> lighting<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.910> room<00:04:02.180> affects<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.959> way

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
the lighting in a room affects the way

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.050 
the lighting in a room affects the way
that<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.320> room<00:04:03.530> looks<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:04.040> these<00:04:04.730> are<00:04:04.880> very

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
that the room looks so these are very

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.570 
that the room looks so these are very
