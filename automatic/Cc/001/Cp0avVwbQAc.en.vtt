00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.369
 little 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.660
 a right he was performing 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.770
 currently and who had made big 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.720
 progress so if in the content without 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.869
 too many hiccups a 4 0 yesterday facing 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.270
 benjamin brushier so quiet for 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.430
 so here he is so for now he's coming 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.160
 very cool physically simon and that's 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.740
 true with european cup 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.329
 and then the four eliminated yesterday have 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.090
 been thunderclaps here 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.100
 the elimination that was somewhere a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.200
 little surprise also face jeremy 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.590
 little bone and then manu lebesson of course 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.360
 who was seeded number 2 here 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.470
 also eliminated his strong forehand and 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.660
 leads to the score 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.110
 it will be necessary that simon arrives at 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.270
 clog her a very nice top exchange on 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.650
 here it is so it's really a 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.900
 client what 31 years now for a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.580
 little more aggressive and I think that as 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.810
 and as of the meeting he goes he goes 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.979
 try to take the initiative the blow 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.979
 right since the beginning of the game 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 oh it was hard it was very difficult 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:25.039
 when to prove it on this point 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.229
 that's behind the shed was done at 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.939
 first set for cement that has 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.799
 especially not scared when he had three 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.880
 balls from the east in confidence all 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.929
 simply and deliver a level of play 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:43.969
 really very very good it works well 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:46.340
 for him here you go 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.179
 the ball is spinning a lot and so been 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.469
 hard to control and then I take advantage 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.200
 also for you will say after we get 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.429
 really focused on this last match 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.109
 straight line for all these players and 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.270
 for these world championships from 13th to 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.659
 May 20 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.119
 if my essay behind his handing over 2 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.119
 fixed brice in their ovaries 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.510
 again handing over the backhand 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.030
 if they show here very well and come 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 with his backhand and here is twice the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.900
 same shed with the reverse that makes 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.550
 truly bad 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.970
 annoyed I would say when he makes mistakes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:30.530
 beasts 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.530
 he thinks about the next point on the other hand 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.310
 attention anyway and then a range 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.819
 absolutely amazing now h and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.260
 simon gauzy long fast service comes back 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.239
 fashionable and it's true that at the level 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.160
 international growing upward 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.660
 pretty good you have not moved well in 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.260
 break it a little bit well 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.260
 handed from also 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:10.630
 superb time he had realized yet 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.810
 a positive set end for simon 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.230
 solid 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.230
 really 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.920
 these palae is also the balloons the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.610
 view of the previous point in defense and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.870
 he managed to remain active even in defense 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.010
 and we know that the calendar still 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.040
 very busy so it's not always 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.569
 obvious there it is completely 0.65 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.090
 that he was really good for 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:49.200
 to be able to enter the first 50 I 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:49.200
 think that soon it's played well 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.260
 we will superbly played seven innings 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.100
 super bravo two match two balls 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.380
 match balls in favor of the second 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.519
 it is true that he plays perfectly well 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.620
 they avoided would be the sava ina signal 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.480
 it's done it's done for simon gauzy 4 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.919
 0 bravo simon because ben for 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.600
 the moment I do not think he lost 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.600
 a set to win 4 0 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.760
 am not passionate about
