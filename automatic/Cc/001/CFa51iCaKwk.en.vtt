00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
rotation to the full cycle of vacation
here<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> sole<00:00:16.590> motto<00:00:16.859> which<00:00:17.340> only<00:00:17.850> rotate

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
here is the sole motto which only rotate

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.580 
here is the sole motto which only rotate
in<00:00:18.480> half<00:00:18.779> cycle<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> duration<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.660> going

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
in half cycle of duration so I'm going

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
in half cycle of duration so I'm going
to<00:00:22.830> demonstrate<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.970> multiplication<00:00:24.689> using

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of each years I will suggest to tap some

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.360 
of each years I will suggest to tap some
photos<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.800> won't<00:00:53.010> regret<00:00:53.219> later

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
photos so that you won't regret later

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.060 
photos so that you won't regret later
keep<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> girls<00:00:56.850> aside<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:58.680> try<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
keep the girls aside and always try to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
keep the girls aside and always try to
set<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> grease<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:00.870> remove<00:01:01.350> him<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
set the grease to not remove him the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.429 
set the grease to not remove him the
first<00:01:04.439> step<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.250> solar<00:01:05.790> modification<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
first step in solar modification is to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
first step in solar modification is to
depress<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> partition<00:01:08.760> meter<00:01:08.939> with

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
depress the partition meter with

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.550 
depress the partition meter with
resistor<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> take<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.350> sake

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
resistor so we have to take out the sake

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
resistor so we have to take out the sake
bomb<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.650> may<00:01:17.040> face<00:01:17.400> difficulty<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.509> trying

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bomb you may face difficulty when trying

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
bomb you may face difficulty when trying
to<00:01:19.140> take<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.770> circuit<00:01:20.159> board<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:21.360> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to take out the circuit board this is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
to take out the circuit board this is
because<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.409> potentiometer<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.490> connect

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
because the potentiometer was connect

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.070 
because the potentiometer was connect
tightly<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> gearbox<00:01:26.299> here<00:01:27.360> my
