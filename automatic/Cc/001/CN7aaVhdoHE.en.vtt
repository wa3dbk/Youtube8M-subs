their<00:01:50.670> stuff<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.140> strictly<00:01:52.619> realistic

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
their stuff it's not strictly realistic

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.130 
their stuff it's not strictly realistic
but<00:01:53.340> since<00:01:54.000> most<00:01:54.360> people<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
but since most people know you in the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.780 
but since most people know you in the
University<00:01:55.680> it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
University it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.950 
University it's
it's<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> nice<00:01:57.969> way<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.149> stock<00:01:58.420> up<00:01:58.450> for<00:01:58.630> your

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
it's a nice way to stock up for your

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
it's a nice way to stock up for your
first<00:01:59.140> couple<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.469> trips<00:01:59.649> into<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.920> wild<00:02:00.250> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
first couple of trips into the wild and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.359 
first couple of trips into the wild and
then<00:02:02.259> there's<00:02:02.409> stuff<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.829> this<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.130> an

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
then there's stuff like this this is an

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.910 
then there's stuff like this this is an
artifact<00:02:03.880> which<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.630> end<00:02:05.020> result<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
artifact which is the end result of the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.100 
artifact which is the end result of the
archeology<00:02:06.579> skill<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.720> instead<00:02:08.050> of

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
archeology skill and so instead of

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.779 
archeology skill and so instead of
having<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.410> explain<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.160> text<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.640> can

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
having to explain this in text I can

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.790 
having to explain this in text I can
sort<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.420> know<00:02:10.450> place<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.319> in<00:02:11.349> an<00:02:11.500> exhibit

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
sort of you know place it in an exhibit

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.920 
sort of you know place it in an exhibit
which<00:02:12.130> makes<00:02:12.700> sense<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> University<00:02:13.780> and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
which makes sense in the University and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.009 
which makes sense in the University and
you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:16.450> might<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.870> something

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
you can see that this might be something

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.199 
you can see that this might be something
that<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.340> might<00:02:18.459> want<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> create<00:02:18.910> at<00:02:19.060> some

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
that you might want to create at some

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.210 
that you might want to create at some
point<00:02:19.420> same<00:02:19.630> with<00:02:19.780> stuff<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.319> weapons<00:02:20.830> or

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
point same with stuff like weapons or

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.970 
point same with stuff like weapons or
you<00:02:21.760> know<00:02:21.880> any<00:02:21.910> craftable<00:02:22.480> goods<00:02:22.860> examples<00:02:23.860> of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you know any craftable goods examples of

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.839 
you know any craftable goods examples of
those<00:02:24.130> things<00:02:24.250> are<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.550> around<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
those things are all around the

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.309 
those things are all around the
University<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.540> there's<00:02:25.720> there's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.170> lot<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
University and there's there's a lot of

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
University and there's there's a lot of
raw<00:02:26.470> materials<00:02:26.920> available<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:28.120> dabble

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
raw materials available to to dabble

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.430 
raw materials available to to dabble
okay<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.420> here's<00:02:31.630> an<00:02:31.750> example<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.349> an

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
okay so here's an example this is an

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.660 
okay so here's an example this is an
archery<00:02:32.769> range<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:34.209> I'll<00:02:34.299> get<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> drink<00:02:34.930> first

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
archery range and I'll get a drink first

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.490 
archery range and I'll get a drink first
where<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.120> pick<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> trainer<00:02:38.019> bow<00:02:38.200> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
where you can pick up a trainer bow and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.320 
where you can pick up a trainer bow and
some<00:02:38.680> arrows<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:39.849> try<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> shoot<00:02:40.269> a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
some arrows and you can try to shoot a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.360 
some arrows and you can try to shoot a
target<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.530> way<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.769> target<00:02:42.040> works<00:02:42.190> is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
target and the way the target works is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
target and the way the target works is
if<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.610> hit<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> bull's-eye<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.840> get<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> little

if you hit a bull's-eye you get a little

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
if you hit a bull's-eye you get a little
boost<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.040> skill<00:02:45.430> based<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.480> how<00:02:46.569> far

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
boost to your skill based on how far

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.080 
boost to your skill based on how far
away<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.959> were<00:02:47.200> when<00:02:47.349> you<00:02:47.380> hit<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.849> now<00:02:48.849> my

away you were when you hit it now my
arse<00:02:49.269> gonna<00:02:49.510> go<00:02:49.630> crazy<00:02:49.840> because<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.319> skill<00:02:50.650> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
low yeah I get the tree you can see the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.900 
low yeah I get the tree you can see the
arrow<00:02:54.459> wobbling<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:56.349> if<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.980> manage<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.370> hit<00:02:57.700> a

an example the kind of thing that you

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.650 
an example the kind of thing that you
can<00:03:10.840> do<00:03:10.959> all<00:03:10.989> around<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> university<00:03:12.660> okay

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
can do all around the university okay

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.970 
can do all around the university okay
here's<00:03:13.900> something<00:03:14.139> that's<00:03:14.290> important<00:03:14.709> early

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
here's something that's important early

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.379 
here's something that's important early
and<00:03:15.340> late<00:03:15.639> in<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.819> game<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.180> guild

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
and late in the game it's the guild

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.170 
and late in the game it's the guild
library<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:17.019> going<00:03:17.709> inside<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
library I'm going inside now and it's a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.580 
library I'm going inside now and it's a
library<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.810> has<00:03:19.930> every<00:03:20.170> kind<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.380> book<00:03:20.500> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
library so it has every kind of book you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890 
library so it has every kind of book you
can<00:03:20.709> imagine<00:03:20.940> now<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.420> find<00:03:22.690> all<00:03:22.780> these

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
can imagine now you can find all these

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.629 
can imagine now you can find all these
books<00:03:23.139> in<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.920> know<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> rest<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> world

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
books in you know the rest of the world

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.759 
books in you know the rest of the world
but<00:03:24.910> something<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.780> guild<00:03:26.109> library<00:03:26.560> tries

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
but something that guild library tries

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.819 
but something that guild library tries
to<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.250> there<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.549> two<00:03:27.819> book<00:03:28.180> stands<00:03:28.829> that

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
to do is there are two book stands that

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.590 
to do is there are two book stands that
you<00:03:29.950> can<00:03:30.130> only<00:03:30.220> access<00:03:30.340> once<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.239> this

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
you can only access once you have this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
that it's a while between the code

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.280 
that it's a while between the code
library<00:03:54.700> spawns<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.720> not<00:03:56.079> as<00:03:56.200> though

behind dark rats a lot of fun it's
really<00:05:14.490> intricate<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.210> don't<00:05:15.600> want<00:05:15.720> to

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
really intricate so I don't want to

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.090 
really intricate so I don't want to
spoil<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.169> but<00:05:16.290> for<00:05:16.470> this<00:05:16.530> video<00:05:16.770> I'll<00:05:16.919> say

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
you know maybe everyone's a little bit

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.110 
you know maybe everyone's a little bit
spooked<00:05:22.710> by<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.070> concept<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.820> dark<00:05:24.000> at

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
spooked by the concept in the dark at

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.040 
spooked by the concept in the dark at
night<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.419> very<00:05:24.630> few<00:05:24.720> people<00:05:24.960> actually

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
night but very few people actually

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.340 
night but very few people actually
believe<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:26.160> they're<00:05:26.850> real<00:05:27.060> but<00:05:28.020> with<00:05:28.110> dark

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
believe that they're real but with dark

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.450 
believe that they're real but with dark
rod<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.680> recent<00:05:28.950> past<00:05:28.979> people<00:05:29.370> have

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
rod in the recent past people have

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.610 
rod in the recent past people have
started<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.880> notice<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.330> around<00:05:30.540> oh<00:05:30.900> here<00:05:31.590> we

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
started to notice it around oh here we

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.490 
started to notice it around oh here we
go<00:05:32.270> now<00:05:33.270> your<00:05:33.419> weapon<00:05:33.690> against<00:05:34.020> our<00:05:34.169> crowd<00:05:34.380> and

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
go now your weapon against our crowd and

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.570 
go now your weapon against our crowd and
the<00:05:34.560> reason<00:05:34.800> why<00:05:34.919> it's<00:05:35.070> not<00:05:35.160> seen<00:05:35.430> in

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
the reason why it's not seen in

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.740 
the reason why it's not seen in
civilization<00:05:36.210> is<00:05:36.330> light

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.060 

yeah<00:05:40.750> if<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.470> don't<00:05:41.620> have<00:05:41.800> your<00:05:41.890> light

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
yeah if you don't have your light

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.100 
yeah if you don't have your light
equipped<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:43.060> that's<00:05:43.660> what's<00:05:43.870> going<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
equipped the that's what's going to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.270 
equipped the that's what's going to
happen<00:05:44.380> you're<00:05:44.500> going<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.680> you're<00:05:45.040> going<00:05:45.070> to

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
happen you're going to you're going to

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.070 
happen you're going to you're going to
be<00:05:45.370> infected<00:05:45.760> with<00:05:45.910> dark<00:05:46.150> rod<00:05:46.420> just<00:05:46.780> like<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:47.050> am

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
be infected with dark rod just like I am

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.590 
be infected with dark rod just like I am
now<00:05:47.230> but<00:05:48.220> if<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.400> do<00:05:48.490> have<00:05:48.700> your<00:05:48.730> light<00:05:49.030> it

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
now but if you do have your light it

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.090 
now but if you do have your light it
will<00:05:49.750> evaporate<00:05:49.990> in<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.500> presence<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.950> that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
will evaporate in the presence of that

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.950 
will evaporate in the presence of that
light<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.520> you<00:05:52.390> don't<00:05:52.540> have<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.690> be<00:05:52.780> holding

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
light and you don't have to be holding

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.350 
light and you don't have to be holding
it<00:05:53.200> you<00:05:53.800> you<00:05:54.070> know<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.220> can<00:05:54.490> deploy<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.180> place

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
it you you know you can deploy it place

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.490 
it you you know you can deploy it place
it<00:05:55.390> on<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.600> ground<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.020> can<00:05:56.110> create<00:05:56.230> a<00:05:56.320> little

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
it on the ground you can create a little

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.640 
it on the ground you can create a little
perimeter<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.980> orb<00:05:57.610> lights<00:05:57.850> if<00:05:58.060> you<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.300> them

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
perimeter of orb lights if you have them

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.260 
perimeter of orb lights if you have them
but<00:05:59.650> light<00:06:00.310> is<00:06:00.490> your<00:06:00.640> friend<00:06:00.850> anything

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
but light is your friend anything

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.710 
but light is your friend anything
brighter<00:06:01.510> than<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.840> torch<00:06:02.140> will<00:06:02.500> evaporate<00:06:02.740> it

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
brighter than a torch will evaporate it

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.880 
brighter than a torch will evaporate it
you<00:06:04.720> can<00:06:04.870> see<00:06:05.020> though<00:06:05.170> that<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.470> core<00:06:05.680> doesn't

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
you can see though that the core doesn't

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.710 
you can see though that the core doesn't
evaporate<00:06:06.190> as<00:06:06.640> quickly<00:06:07.000> as<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.300> rest<00:06:07.480> of<00:06:07.600> it

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
evaporate as quickly as the rest of it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.600 
evaporate as quickly as the rest of it
and<00:06:07.900> as<00:06:08.530> long<00:06:08.710> as<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:09.010> core<00:06:09.190> is<00:06:09.280> hanging<00:06:09.550> out

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
and as long as the core is hanging out

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.920 
and as long as the core is hanging out
you<00:06:09.760> can<00:06:09.880> still<00:06:10.060> get<00:06:10.150> infected<00:06:10.450> if<00:06:10.660> you<00:06:10.750> bump

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
you can still get infected if you bump

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.480 
you can still get infected if you bump
into<00:06:11.080> it<00:06:11.290> so<00:06:11.530> you<00:06:11.590> want<00:06:11.890> to<00:06:12.010> steer<00:06:12.190> clear<00:06:12.220> of

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
into it so you want to steer clear of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.920 
into it so you want to steer clear of
them<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:12.910> you<00:06:13.180> also<00:06:13.330> want<00:06:13.570> to<00:06:13.630> stay<00:06:13.750> on<00:06:13.780> the

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
them and you also want to stay on the

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.420 
them and you also want to stay on the
move<00:06:14.050> because<00:06:14.500> if<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.800> whole<00:06:14.980> bunch<00:06:15.160> of<00:06:15.220> dark

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
move because if a whole bunch of dark

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.940 
move because if a whole bunch of dark
crack<00:06:15.640> whores<00:06:15.880> are<00:06:16.200> surrounding<00:06:17.200> you<00:06:17.350> you

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
crack whores are surrounding you you

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.360 
crack whores are surrounding you you
find<00:06:18.220> yourself<00:06:18.580> stuck<00:06:19.360> until<00:06:20.170> morning<00:06:20.740> just

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
find yourself stuck until morning just

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.250 
find yourself stuck until morning just
fighting<00:06:21.880> off<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.000> clouds<00:06:24.780> so<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.930> danger<00:06:26.230> of

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
fighting off the clouds so the danger of

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.960 
fighting off the clouds so the danger of
dark<00:06:26.530> grab<00:06:26.710> isn't<00:06:27.010> in<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.190> attack<00:06:27.520> it's<00:06:27.790> in

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
dark grab isn't in the attack it's in

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.750 
dark grab isn't in the attack it's in
the<00:06:28.270> the<00:06:28.660> poison<00:06:29.170> over<00:06:29.440> time<00:06:29.710> your<00:06:30.370> health<00:06:30.580> is

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
the the poison over time your health is

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.700 
the the poison over time your health is
reduced<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.660> smallest<00:06:32.140> possible<00:06:32.410> value

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
reduced to the smallest possible value

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.360 
reduced to the smallest possible value
and<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.970> can't<00:06:34.300> heal<00:06:35.140> dark<00:06:35.500> rod<00:06:35.740> except<00:06:36.220> at<00:06:36.340> a

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
and you can't heal dark rod except at a

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.420 
and you can't heal dark rod except at a
house<00:06:36.520> of<00:06:36.730> healing<00:06:36.880> so<00:06:38.190> another's<00:06:39.190> a<00:06:39.220> wolf

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
house of healing so another's a wolf

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.950 
house of healing so another's a wolf
then<00:06:39.610> so<00:06:39.850> let's<00:06:40.030> let's<00:06:40.360> see<00:06:40.510> how<00:06:40.630> long<00:06:40.690> I<00:06:40.930> can

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
then so let's let's see how long I can

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.820 
then so let's let's see how long I can
last<00:06:41.110> against<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.830> wolf<00:06:42.040> here<00:06:46.350> back<00:06:47.350> in<00:06:47.530> here

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
last against the wolf here back in here

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.050 
last against the wolf here back in here
