today's video we're going to be doing a
little<00:00:15.179> bit<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.420> cataleya<00:00:15.960> maintenance<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
little bit of cataleya maintenance I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.200 
little bit of cataleya maintenance I
wanted<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> talk<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> care<00:00:18.060> and

wanted to talk to you about the care and
culture<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.600> catalase<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.340> tips<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.640> them

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
culture of catalase and tips to get them

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.080 
culture of catalase and tips to get them
to<00:00:21.090> rebloom<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.070> guy<00:00:23.160> last<00:00:23.550> spring

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to rebloom so I got this guy last spring

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.359 
to rebloom so I got this guy last spring
it<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> call<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> rescue

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it was what I'm going to call a rescue

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
it was what I'm going to call a rescue
cataleya<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.420> five<00:00:27.630> dollars<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.230> had<00:00:28.380> no

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
cataleya it was five dollars it had no

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070 
cataleya it was five dollars it had no
roots<00:00:28.830> whatsoever<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.420> thought<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.810> up<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
roots whatsoever and I thought I'm up to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
roots whatsoever and I thought I'm up to
the<00:00:31.170> challenge<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:32.969> with

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the challenge and see what I can do with

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.970 
the challenge and see what I can do with
it<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> first<00:00:34.230> thing<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.530> did<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it so the first thing I did was I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.700 
it so the first thing I did was I
repotted<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> into<00:00:36.300> new<00:00:36.570> media<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> know

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
repotted it into new media so I know

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
repotted it into new media so I know
exactly<00:00:38.210> what's<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> pot<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.230> old<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
exactly what's in the pot and how old it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490 
exactly what's in the pot and how old it
is<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.579> planted<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> large<00:00:42.570> bark<00:00:43.050> mix

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
is I just planted it in a large bark mix

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
is I just planted it in a large bark mix
in<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.430> tiny<00:00:44.730> pot<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.050> no

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
in a very tiny pot because it had no

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
in a very tiny pot because it had no
roots<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.620> didn't<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.329> give<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.450> too<00:00:48.629> much

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
roots I didn't want to give it too much

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.260 
roots I didn't want to give it too much
space<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.379> wobble<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.120> if

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
space to wobble around I don't know if

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.740 
space to wobble around I don't know if
you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.360> visible<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you can see in here if it's visible I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
you can see in here if it's visible I
also<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.860> anchor<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> metal

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
also put a little anchor it's a metal

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
also put a little anchor it's a metal
piece<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.750> put<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.800> outside<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
piece that I put through the outside of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060 
piece that I put through the outside of
the<00:00:59.280> pot<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.149> goes<00:01:00.300> across<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the pot and it goes across and what it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
the pot and it goes across and what it
did<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.250> once<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.660> media<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.140> held

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
did was once it was in the media it held

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
did was once it was in the media it held
it<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> place<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> wired<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it in place so I kind of wired it in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
it in place so I kind of wired it in
place<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.380> start<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
place to start with because if when you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
place to start with because if when you
have<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> cataleya<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.040> no

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have a cataleya like this that has no

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
have a cataleya like this that has no
roots<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.390> trying<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.110> establish<00:01:13.350> roots

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
roots and it's trying to establish roots

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.200 
roots and it's trying to establish roots
but<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.280> constantly<00:01:14.610> wobbling<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
but it's constantly wobbling back and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
but it's constantly wobbling back and
forth<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.439> first<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
forth the first thing that's going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
forth the first thing that's going to
happen<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.460> those<00:01:17.640> new<00:01:17.820> root<00:01:18.000> tips<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.390> going

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
happen is those new root tips are going

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
happen is those new root tips are going
to<00:01:18.570> break<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
to break off and you are then going to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
to break off and you are then going to
be<00:01:21.060> again<00:01:21.600> stuck<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> cataleya<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.650> no

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
be again stuck with a cataleya with no

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550 
be again stuck with a cataleya with no
roots<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.000> first<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
roots so first thing you want to do is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
roots so first thing you want to do is
get<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> securely<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.970> doesn't

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
get it securely in there it doesn't

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.460 
get it securely in there it doesn't
matter<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> tie<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
matter if you even if you have to tie it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
matter if you even if you have to tie it
around<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> bottom<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> pot<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:29.850> drill

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
around the bottom of the pot or drill

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
around the bottom of the pot or drill
some<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.990> holes<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.380> ahead<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
some little holes in ahead of time to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
some little holes in ahead of time to
wire<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.420> sure<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.720> cataleya<00:01:34.200> isn't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
wire it in make sure that cataleya isn't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
wire it in make sure that cataleya isn't
going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> move<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:36.360> new<00:01:36.810> new<00:01:37.320> roots<00:01:37.560> aren't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
going to move now new new roots aren't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
going to move now new new roots aren't
going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.189> grow<00:01:38.340> off<00:01:38.640> old<00:01:38.939> growth<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.070> then

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
going to grow off old growth so then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to grow off old growth so then
what<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.240> trigger<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.840> new

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
what we have to do is trigger some new

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
what we have to do is trigger some new
growth<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.530> grow<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> keep<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
growth to grow so we want to keep it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.350 
growth to grow so we want to keep it
just<00:01:45.509> mildly<00:01:46.320> moist<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:47.220> some<00:01:47.520> drenching<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just mildly moist not some drenching it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
just mildly moist not some drenching it
there's<00:01:48.509> no<00:01:48.630> roots<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> water<00:01:49.380> anyway

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
there's no roots there to water anyway

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100 
there's no roots there to water anyway
so<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> big<00:01:50.579> deal<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so it's not a big deal if it's some just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
so it's not a big deal if it's some just
keeps<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> moist<00:01:52.979> side<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.790> just

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
keeps it on the moist side I would just

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
keeps it on the moist side I would just
spray<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.360> water<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.840> opposed<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
spray it with water as opposed to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
spray it with water as opposed to
actually<00:01:55.890> soaking<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> once<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.270> new<00:01:57.450> growth

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
actually soaking it once the new growth

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.560 
actually soaking it once the new growth
started<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> new<00:02:00.329> roots

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
started here that's when the new roots

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
started here that's when the new roots
would<00:02:00.719> start<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> roots<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.219> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
would start so all the roots on this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
would start so all the roots on this
plan<00:02:02.579> are<00:02:02.610> basically<00:02:03.210> from<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.630> growth<00:02:03.930> here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
plan are basically from this growth here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.190 
plan are basically from this growth here
but<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.880> took<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.540> withdrawing<00:02:06.960> roots

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
but it really took off withdrawing roots

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
but it really took off withdrawing roots
you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.129> now<00:02:08.310> roots<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.759> come<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you can see now roots have come out the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.580 
you can see now roots have come out the
bottom<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.720> they're<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.379> side

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bottom and they're going over the side

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.650 
bottom and they're going over the side
you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.670> even<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.120> through<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.390> holes

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
you can even see them through the holes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
you can even see them through the holes
in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> pot<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
in the pot there

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.350 
in the pot there
that<00:02:14.520> there's<00:02:14.670> roots<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.940> go<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.270> way

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that there's roots that go all the way

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
that there's roots that go all the way
down<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.750> very<00:02:15.810> stable<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.740> think<00:02:17.400> after

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
down it's very stable now I think after

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.550 
down it's very stable now I think after
it's<00:02:17.970> done<00:02:18.150> blooming<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.260> repot<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it's done blooming I'm going to repot it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's done blooming I'm going to repot it
into<00:02:19.920> something<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.640> bigger<00:02:21.860> as<00:02:22.860> I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
into something a little bit bigger as I

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.880 
into something a little bit bigger as I
say<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.670> medium<00:02:24.000> bark<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.390> now

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
say it's in a medium bark right now

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
say it's in a medium bark right now
really<00:02:25.890> anchored<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.490> there<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.850> wired<00:02:27.240> in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
really anchored in there well wired in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.530 
really anchored in there well wired in
place<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:28.050> think<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.800> even<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.400> where<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.300> went<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
place I think I even see where I went to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.570 
place I think I even see where I went to
cross<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> piece<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.290> wire<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.040> then

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
cross with a piece of wire here and then

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.670 
cross with a piece of wire here and then
because<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.660> wire<00:02:33.810> went<00:02:34.050> across<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> pot

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
because the wire went across the pot

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
because the wire went across the pot
eyes<00:02:35.070> app<00:02:35.430> strapped<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.090> these<00:02:36.180> pseudo

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
eyes app strapped one of these pseudo

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.330 
eyes app strapped one of these pseudo
bulbs<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.140> wire<00:02:37.320> again<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.920> keep<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> from

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
bulbs to the wire again to keep it from

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.770 
bulbs to the wire again to keep it from
moving<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.820> keep<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:39.180> rocking<00:02:39.570> back<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
moving to keep it from rocking back and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.250 
moving to keep it from rocking back and
forth<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.490> key<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.260> making

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
forth and that's really key to making

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.080 
forth and that's really key to making
sure<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.620> grows<00:02:43.890> new<00:02:44.160> strong<00:02:44.520> healthy<00:02:44.880> roots

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
sure it grows new strong healthy roots

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.360 
sure it grows new strong healthy roots
so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.930> guy<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.230> beautiful

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
so this guy is a beautiful

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.300 
so this guy is a beautiful
cataleya<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:49.050> smells<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.860> roses

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's no other way to describe it I don't

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.229 
it's no other way to describe it I don't
think<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.100> labeled<00:02:53.520> correctly<00:02:53.670> anymore

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
think it's labeled correctly anymore

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.640 
think it's labeled correctly anymore
although<00:02:54.630> at<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.780> point<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.320> name<00:02:55.500> would

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
although at one point this name would

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.290 
although at one point this name would
have<00:02:55.709> been<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.250> don't<00:02:56.880> think<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.180> right

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
have been right I don't think it's right

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.640 
have been right I don't think it's right
anymore

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
anymore

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.500 
anymore

there is some ugly leaves on here a few
options<00:03:13.440> for<00:03:13.530> these<00:03:14.010> ugly<00:03:14.400> leaves<00:03:14.610> now<00:03:15.360> you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
options for these ugly leaves now you

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.729 
options for these ugly leaves now you
can't<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:15.959> leave<00:03:16.080> them<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.590> they're

you'd want to do to trim off these

leaves you never want to cut the pseudo
bulb<00:03:29.160> itself<00:03:29.519> because<00:03:29.820> that's<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.150> stores

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
bulb itself because that's what stores

the<00:03:30.570> energy<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.170> plant<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.450> can

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
the energy for the plant but you can

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
the energy for the plant but you can
take<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> pair<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.080> scissors<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.130> went<00:03:35.370> ahead

take a pair of scissors now I went ahead

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.820 
take a pair of scissors now I went ahead
earlier<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.510> sterilized<00:03:36.959> these<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.380> rubbing

while that way you're not going to be

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.530 
while that way you're not going to be
transferring<00:03:44.130> any<00:03:44.280> disease<00:03:44.640> from<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:45.090> orc<00:03:45.269> to

transferring any disease from one orc to
another<00:03:45.780> orchid<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:47.400> could<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:47.790> some

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
another orchid and you could just some

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.729 
another orchid and you could just some
cut<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.600> off<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> pair<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.470> sharp

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
cut this off just with a pair of sharp

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.060 
cut this off just with a pair of sharp
sterilized<00:03:50.250> scissors<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:52.070> there

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
sterilized scissors like so and there

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.280 
sterilized scissors like so and there
goes<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.310> leaf<00:03:53.720> now<00:03:54.720> we're<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.049> left<00:03:55.200> with

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
goes that leaf now we're just left with

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.400 
goes that leaf now we're just left with
this<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.019> kind<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.260> ugly

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
this one here because it's kind of ugly

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.240 
this one here because it's kind of ugly
I'm<00:03:58.709> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.130> just<00:03:59.280> diagonally<00:04:00.120> cut<00:04:00.390> this

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
I'm going to just diagonally cut this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.400 
I'm going to just diagonally cut this
across<00:04:02.250> here<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.019> give<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.110> more<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.350> a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
across here and give it more of a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.890 
across here and give it more of a
natural<00:04:04.620> appearance<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:06.360> that's<00:04:06.690> been

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
natural appearance to it so that's been

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.930 
natural appearance to it so that's been
taken<00:04:07.230> care<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.470> now<00:04:07.739> looks<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.670> little<00:04:08.700> bit

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
taken care of now looks a little bit

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.090 
taken care of now looks a little bit
better<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.390> lot<00:04:09.690> better<00:04:09.900> than<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.170> did<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.920> is

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
better a lot better than it did this is

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.580 
better a lot better than it did this is
what<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.280> cut<00:04:11.549> last<00:04:11.970> year<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:13.019> can<00:04:13.140> see<00:04:13.320> how<00:04:13.470> it

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
what I cut last year you can see how it

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.170 
what I cut last year you can see how it
continued<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.100> dry<00:04:14.340> up<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.610> little<00:04:14.820> bit<00:04:14.970> along

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
continued to dry up a little bit along

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.569 
continued to dry up a little bit along
the<00:04:15.209> edge<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.959> if<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.950> remember<00:04:17.310> correctly

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
the edge but I if I remember correctly

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.360 
the edge but I if I remember correctly
this<00:04:17.729> was<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> big<00:04:18.150> black<00:04:18.390> leaf<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.840> well<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.799> I'm

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
this was a big black leaf as well so I'm

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.070 
this was a big black leaf as well so I'm
going<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.609> leave<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.850> one<00:04:21.000> for<00:04:21.239> now<00:04:21.390> although

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
going to leave this one for now although

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.140 
going to leave this one for now although
it's<00:04:22.229> ugly<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.919> still<00:04:23.150> photosynthesizing

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
it's ugly it's still photosynthesizing

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.420 
it's ugly it's still photosynthesizing
it's<00:04:24.660> still<00:04:24.870> producing<00:04:24.990> some<00:04:25.530> nutrients<00:04:26.220> for

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
it's still producing some nutrients for

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.720 
it's still producing some nutrients for
the<00:04:26.490> plant

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
the plant

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.460 
the plant
but<00:04:27.940> look<00:04:28.060> at<00:04:28.180> how<00:04:28.300> nice<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.600> rich<00:04:29.200> and

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
but look at how nice and rich and

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.640 
but look at how nice and rich and
healthy<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:30.040> new<00:04:30.340> growth<00:04:30.550> looks<00:04:30.880> here<00:04:31.150> and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
healthy this new growth looks here and

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.640 
healthy this new growth looks here and
as<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.830> say<00:04:32.980> it's<00:04:33.130> just<00:04:33.190> beautiful<00:04:34.380> smells<00:04:35.380> so

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
as I say it's just beautiful smells so

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.090 
as I say it's just beautiful smells so
good

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.900 
good
so<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.330> reward<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.200> guy<00:04:38.410> when<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.100> approaches

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
so I reward this guy when it approaches

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.620 
so I reward this guy when it approaches
dryness<00:04:40.360> with<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.170> extra<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:42.150> think<00:04:43.150> my<00:04:43.270> heater

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
dryness with the extra I think my heater

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.460 
dryness with the extra I think my heater
just<00:04:43.720> kicked<00:04:44.110> Dylan<00:04:44.380> hold<00:04:44.620> on<00:04:45.390> there<00:04:46.390> we<00:04:46.480> go<00:04:46.510> my

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
just kicked Dylan hold on there we go my

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.460 
just kicked Dylan hold on there we go my
heater<00:04:47.680> kicked<00:04:47.950> on<00:04:48.070> below<00:04:48.340> me<00:04:49.260> Irie<00:04:50.260> water

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
heater kicked on below me Irie water

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.620 
heater kicked on below me Irie water
this<00:04:50.650> when<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.920> approaches<00:04:51.340> dryness<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:51.910> start

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
this when it approaches dryness to start

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.480 
this when it approaches dryness to start
with<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.840> put<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> little<00:04:53.320> layer<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.560> moss<00:04:54.130> on<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
with I put a little layer of moss on the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.880 
with I put a little layer of moss on the
top<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.090> bark<00:04:55.360> just<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.260> retain<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.590> little

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
top of the bark just to retain a little

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.410 
top of the bark just to retain a little
bit<00:04:57.070> more<00:04:57.220> moisture<00:04:57.400> right<00:04:57.850> around<00:04:58.090> where<00:04:58.300> the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
bit more moisture right around where the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.630 
bit more moisture right around where the
root<00:04:58.600> growth<00:04:58.840> would<00:04:59.050> start<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.620> think<00:05:00.520> that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
root growth would start I think that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.760 
root growth would start I think that
helped<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.940> little<00:05:01.060> bit<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.510> look<00:05:02.380> forward<00:05:02.710> to

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
helped a little bit I look forward to

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.190 
helped a little bit I look forward to
getting<00:05:03.670> this<00:05:03.760> thing<00:05:03.820> into<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.240> bigger<00:05:04.630> pot<00:05:04.870> now

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
getting this thing into a bigger pot now

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.990 
getting this thing into a bigger pot now
that<00:05:05.410> it's<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.770> would<00:05:06.130> say<00:05:06.250> pretty<00:05:06.580> much<00:05:06.670> made<00:05:06.970> a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
that it's I would say pretty much made a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.760 
that it's I would say pretty much made a
complete<00:05:07.420> recovery<00:05:07.690> with<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.530> amount<00:05:08.710> of

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770
