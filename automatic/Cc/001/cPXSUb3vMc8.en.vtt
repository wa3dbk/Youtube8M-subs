USD s today all my stuff from Hobby city
came<00:00:07.309> it<00:00:08.309> can't<00:00:08.849> believe<00:00:09.150> how<00:00:09.630> small<00:00:10.130> this

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
came it can't believe how small this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.560 
came it can't believe how small this
little<00:00:11.519> motor<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.110> it's<00:00:13.110> 10<00:00:13.740> grand<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.280> it's

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
little motor is it's 10 grand is it's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320 
little motor is it's 10 grand is it's
9.2<00:00:15.570> grams<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
9.2 grams and if you can see this is the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.910 
9.2 grams and if you can see this is the
xtronic<00:00:18.840> 500<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.460> 5<00:00:21.210> grams<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.590> sit

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
xtronic 500 which is 5 grams if you sit

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
xtronic 500 which is 5 grams if you sit
next<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
next to it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.790 
next to it
you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> size<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.900> really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you can see the size of it it's really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.450 
you can see the size of it it's really
really<00:00:29.130> tiny<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> six<00:00:31.769> grams

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
really tiny and the six grams

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.140 
really tiny and the six grams
EFC<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.840> tiny<00:00:34.079> too<00:00:34.610> plain<00:00:35.610> I've

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
EFC that's really tiny too plain I've

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.910 
EFC that's really tiny too plain I've
got<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.570> set<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.989> I've<00:00:37.199> got<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.680> motor

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
got all set up I've got the little motor

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.360 
got all set up I've got the little motor
mount<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> will<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.160> here

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
mount in there this will go in here

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.340 
mount in there this will go in here
really<00:00:41.760> nice<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.390> fits<00:00:42.769> perfectly<00:00:43.769> I<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.220> I

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
really nice it fits perfectly I just I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.229 
really nice it fits perfectly I just I
just<00:00:46.350> can't<00:00:46.739> believe<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.820> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
just can't believe how well this is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
just can't believe how well this is
gonna<00:00:48.420> fit<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.019> gonna<00:00:49.140> fit<00:00:49.409> right<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.949> here

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
gonna fit it's gonna fit right in here

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.530 
gonna fit it's gonna fit right in here
and<00:00:51.620> hopefully<00:00:52.909> it'll<00:00:53.909> be<00:00:54.000> pretty<00:00:54.239> nice

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
and hopefully it'll be pretty nice

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.869 
and hopefully it'll be pretty nice
should<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.989> fairly<00:00:55.199> easy<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.769> together

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.760 

finished<00:00:59.879> putting<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> motor<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
finished putting the motor in there and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.119 
finished putting the motor in there and
motor<00:01:02.100> mounting<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> servos<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
motor mounting two of servos as you can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
motor mounting two of servos as you can
see<00:01:05.399> this<00:01:06.060> motor<00:01:06.509> mouth<00:01:06.810> fit<00:01:07.259> in<00:01:07.410> there<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
see this motor mouth fit in there really

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
see this motor mouth fit in there really
nice<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.670> mean<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:09.660> I<00:01:09.899> couldn't<00:01:10.530> ask<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.770> more

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
nice I mean it I couldn't ask for more

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.150 
nice I mean it I couldn't ask for more
it<00:01:11.310> fit<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.300> there<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:13.160> fitted

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
it fit right in there just fitted

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.930 
it fit right in there just fitted
perfectly<00:01:14.399> without<00:01:14.940> hitting<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.550> sides<00:01:17.550> of

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
perfectly without hitting the sides of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.800 
perfectly without hitting the sides of
the<00:01:18.090> plane<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:20.100> fit<00:01:20.429> perfect<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.390> tried

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the plane or it fit perfect and I tried

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
the plane or it fit perfect and I tried
a<00:01:22.910> test<00:01:23.910> rough<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> has<00:01:25.140> plenty<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a test rough on it and it has plenty of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.330 
a test rough on it and it has plenty of
thrust<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.550> little<00:01:26.820> 9.2<00:01:27.509> grand<00:01:27.810> motor<00:01:28.340> what

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
thrust of a little 9.2 grand motor what

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.420 
thrust of a little 9.2 grand motor what
I<00:01:29.369> found<00:01:29.700> though<00:01:30.110> if<00:01:31.110> space<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:32.220> very

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I found though if space is very very

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
I found though if space is very very
limited<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.060> mean<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:33.930> paint<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
limited I mean it's very very paint in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
limited I mean it's very very paint in
here<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.729> even<00:01:35.909> sure<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.780> mop

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
here I'm not even sure how I'm gonna mop

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.340 
here I'm not even sure how I'm gonna mop
the<00:01:37.200> battery<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.810> receiver<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the battery or the receiver in here and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
the battery or the receiver in here and
I've<00:01:40.409> also<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> ESC<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.030> quite<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
I've also got the ESC so it's quite a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
I've also got the ESC so it's quite a
lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.500> stuff<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.610> small

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
lot of stuff for this you know small

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.800 
lot of stuff for this you know small
little<00:01:45.299> plane

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
little plane

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
little plane
what<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> thought<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.799> doing<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.220> maybe

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
what I thought about doing is maybe

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.560 
what I thought about doing is maybe
making<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> battery

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
making a battery

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
making a battery
hatch<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.869> whatever<00:01:52.140> at<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.290> bottom<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.790> can

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
hatch or whatever at the bottom I can

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.149 
hatch or whatever at the bottom I can
just<00:01:54.119> Valco<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.690> bat<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.320> battery<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just Valco the bat and be battery and to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.630 
just Valco the bat and be battery and to
the<00:01:56.250> bottom<00:01:56.549> battery<00:01:57.360> certainly<00:01:57.780> small<00:01:58.640> size

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the bottom battery certainly small size

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.950 
the bottom battery certainly small size
the<00:01:59.790> battery<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.800> if<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.810> thing<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the battery is you know if that thing it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.350 
the battery is you know if that thing it
fits<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.740> plane<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:06.270> know

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
fits right to the plane so you know

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
fits right to the plane so you know
maybe<00:02:06.600> perhaps<00:02:07.280> just<00:02:08.720> Valle<00:02:09.720> crow<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.380> stick

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
maybe perhaps just Valle crow and stick

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040 
maybe perhaps just Valle crow and stick
it<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> bottom<00:02:11.730> somewhere<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.870> give

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it on the bottom somewhere so I can give

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.590 
it on the bottom somewhere so I can give
some<00:02:13.230> space<00:02:13.790> free<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> some<00:02:15.090> space<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.540> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
some space free up some space with a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.750 
some space free up some space with a
receiver<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.280> good<00:02:17.430> stuff<00:02:17.489> but

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
receiver and and all that good stuff but
