00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
done a good job as far as you know not

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.000 
done a good job as far as you know not
only<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.990> offseason<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.890> know

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
only now but in the offseason you know

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.300 
only now but in the offseason you know
watching<00:00:26.430> tape<00:00:26.640> learning<00:00:27.300> their<00:00:27.420> assignments

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
watching tape learning their assignments

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.620 
watching tape learning their assignments
no<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.429> were<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> fit<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.359> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
no one were to be where to fit out so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
no one were to be where to fit out so
it's<00:00:31.019> been<00:00:31.199> obviously<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.830> smoothie<00:00:32.250> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it's been obviously a lot smoothie this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
it's been obviously a lot smoothie this
time<00:00:32.610> round<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:33.360> difference<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.350> am

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
time round what difference can I am

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.709 
time round what difference can I am
truly<00:00:35.040> expect<00:00:35.460> city<00:00:35.820> after<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> haven't<00:00:36.630> gone

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
truly expect city after you haven't gone

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
truly expect city after you haven't gone
through<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> system<00:00:37.140> years<00:00:37.559> ago<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.309> opposed

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
through the system years ago as opposed

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
through the system years ago as opposed
to<00:00:38.760> expose<00:00:39.090> timeout<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.590> any<00:00:40.860> time

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
to expose timeout so I think any time

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
to expose timeout so I think any time
the<00:00:41.160> more<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.640> something<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> better<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the more you do something to better you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
the more you do something to better you
are<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.399> we've<00:00:44.579> been<00:00:44.730> pretty

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
are and you know we've been pretty

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.440 
are and you know we've been pretty
consistent<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.660> we're<00:00:45.809> doing<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:48.360> know

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
consistent what we're doing and you know

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.119 
consistent what we're doing and you know
we<00:00:48.570> work<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.870> our<00:00:48.930> habits<00:00:49.289> every<00:00:49.500> day<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.860> far

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
we work on our habits every day as far

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
we work on our habits every day as far
as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.820> run<00:00:51.030> into<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> ball<00:00:51.480> playing

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
as you know run into the ball playing

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.529 
as you know run into the ball playing
hard<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.760> trying<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> create<00:00:54.390> those

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
hard you know trying to create those

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
hard you know trying to create those
habitual<00:00:54.899> traits<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.949> think<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> stuff

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
habitual traits and I think that stuff

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
habitual traits and I think that stuff
carries<00:00:56.850> over<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.649> more

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
carries over and I think the more

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.229 
carries over and I think the more
comfortable<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.030> you're

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
comfortable you are and what you're

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
comfortable you are and what you're
doing<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.809> stuff<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> shows<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
doing that stuff kind of shows to you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
doing that stuff kind of shows to you
know<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> continue

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
know so I think that we got to continue

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
know so I think that we got to continue
to<00:01:04.799> work<00:01:04.890> hard<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> prepare<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.530> do

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to work hard and prepare and you know do

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
to work hard and prepare and you know do
the<00:01:07.799> things<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.310> need<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the things that we need to do from a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
the things that we need to do from a
preparation<00:01:09.689> standpoint<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.619> play<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> kind

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
preparation standpoint to play the kind

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.469 
preparation standpoint to play the kind

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.429 
makes our team better so you know
defensively<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> do

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
defensively that's what we want to do

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
defensively that's what we want to do
you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.560> nobody's<00:01:53.369> etched<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.670> stone<00:01:53.700> right

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you know nobody's etched in stone right

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
you know nobody's etched in stone right
now<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.540> mean<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> rank<00:01:55.740> them

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
now I mean we're going to rank them

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
now I mean we're going to rank them
every<00:01:56.070> day<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.360> need<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.750> some

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
every day and if we need to make some

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.359 
every day and if we need to make some
more<00:01:58.079> adjustments<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> road

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
more adjustments we will down the road

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.969 
more adjustments we will down the road
and<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.840> competition<00:02:01.439> makes<00:02:01.619> everyone

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and I think competition makes everyone

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.570 
and I think competition makes everyone
better<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
better and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.040 
better and
I<00:02:03.640> think<00:02:04.120> it's<00:02:04.240> how<00:02:04.540> did<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.960> learn

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
I think it's how did you have to learn

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.960 
I think it's how did you have to learn
how<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.260> compete<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.950> win<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.130> position<00:02:06.820> before

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
how to compete to win a position before

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.990 
how to compete to win a position before
you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.360> help<00:02:07.450> us<00:02:07.570> way<00:02:07.720> again
