00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.650
 villahermosa tabasco cachita up in 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:14.840
 the lampposts and their paper world 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.860
 by the neighbors who believe and cheerful 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.119
 faith 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.119
 and how I went to travel the world but 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:32.719
 They know that I bring you a wonderful 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.630
 flower they did not make it because my neighbors the 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.960
 Japanese that I admire them as much as 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.809
 I said I invented I have learned 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.640
 copied then what little much that 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.129
 he has learned I am going to teach you 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.020
 recognize my neighbors because they are a 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.730
 wonder to make this art 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.910
 then I will teach them how to do the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.660
 flower that seems to hold your leaf 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.940
 paper let's take a green and a 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.760
 pink a yellow is not the color that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.369
 give us the pints right now of whites and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.189
 so let's start let's start 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.310
 do the workshop forward let's grab 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.760
 a sheet of paper and we are going to fold 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.190
 corner of the leaf 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.610
 so in this way try to make sure 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.480
 well folded let's cut with the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.140
 scissors 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.940
 on the left bank I hope you have 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.680
 learned other figures that I taught them 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.870
 previously 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.580
 let's open the square is a square 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.420
 as you will see we are going to double 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.250
 sheared the shore that ends well something 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.450
 just like dad does not tell my students 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.850
 here in villahermosa they say it's a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.130
 kite we give kite shape and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 that we double here on this side from 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.580
 here we are going to fold it from the front 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.470
 then we take the sheet and we fold the same 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.850
 the side and side notice that doubles is more 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.980
 small 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.020
 so very well 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.700
 now we are going to fold we go back to double 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.400
 from this other side where we double 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.410
 first we are going to double we are 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.780
 making the stem and the leaf of the flower 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.649
 At the same time, look carefully 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.099
 a square 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.099
 here like that we doubled in half 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.410
 since we fold in half we're going to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.260
 fold this piquito then also to the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.299
 half like that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.720
 now we close the fold in our 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.720
 shape 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.319
 and we give form to the figure this is the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.690
 part of the leaf stem right now 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.660
 let's make the flower to make the flower 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.310
 let's grab another now 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.530
 nothing else we're going to do more 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.850
 little girl is made of it also very 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.230
 big according to what we are going to cut 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.280
 with the scissors so that it comes out 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.280
 perfect the boat 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.260
 now we are going to double it is that nadal now 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.910
 Like you are going to do a picture 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:14.460
 doing the part of the candle 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.350
 of the flower stem since we doubled already 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.630
 another smaller box comes out you can 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.680
 say that half a sheet we're going to 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.680
 fold by half 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.840
 we unfolded and folded for the other half 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.330
 so well or the one that visits in tabasco 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.950
 because it's a wonderful place and it's 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.970
 I recommend that you can say that the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.120
 paradise we are going to fold we form together 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.200
 the ties the piquitos and they leave 4 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.330
 little pits here around look good two 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.000
 small piquitos here and two piquitos out 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.760
 notice how they are 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.220
 now since we made this double we're going to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.700
 give these piquitos 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.740
 towards the edges of side and side 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.680
 on both sides 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.900
 the piquitos are already soft and the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.650
 little flower we get so much glue that we do not 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.650
 we have at hand 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.319
 at home 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.000
 side and side not much glue 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.510
 because the glue things have to be 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.610
 look after them are very expensive and I hit it 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.830
 can wait a little while like three 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.340
 hours to do that is not true and 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.340
 we open it 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.030
 and there's the flower 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.340
 what else do our neighbors do and what 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.720
 believe I just invented a ballerina 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.700
 but that invention of mine 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.250
 Now I'm going to present it to you 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.020
 let's finish the flower and then I'll leave 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.750
 to teach how to do 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.410
 good since we have the flower we grab 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.410
 the stem 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.710
 we make an ojito here in the flower sorry 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.410
 and here we take him once this is done 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.260
 so that they have the clear flower that 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.960
 this has to wait for it to dry 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.940
 good 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.770
 let's see let's see he's missing a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.420
 little bit calm that I calmed 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:20.590
 we cut a little bit more that 's 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:23.330
 that's it and then install flower but 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.160
 This actually puts the bases and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.270
 is is cut is double the shivers 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.030
 is 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.430
 it sticks when this is already my invention already 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.580
 does this is already for you to put 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 the flower that I already invented it 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.390
 collaborating with my neighbors 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.210
 now we hit him here 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.800
 and that the sword is a gift 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.919
 for a gift for the bride 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.990
 for a wedding put your fingers in the 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.569
 table are wonderful 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.729

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.470

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.530

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.840
 twenty thousand figures do not forget how you 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.530
 He talks about the flower buds 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.530
 now 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.310
 what do you think the flower lovely friends 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.080
 of dawn learn I think that in this 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.540
 There must be a lot of friendship in the world 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.669
 communication because we are all 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.710
 all because we are fighting for nothing 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.600
 that all compels us to nothing 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.910
 God wants a world of peace and we 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.710
 we can do it we go to the street 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.840
 greeting neighbors to friends 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.150
 because I remind you again of a 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.860
 enemy we need let's join the 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.930

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.730

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.770
 little ones and that is no longer for us 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.479

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:57.080
