00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 every year after welcome 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 back in Rosenheim like his yours 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.990
 impressions of the recent course of the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.179
 preparation very well we have a lot 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 have a lot of hard work behind us 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 trained a lot and are now too 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 glad that it finally starts because the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
 preparation is good and nice but if 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
 it comes to points then of course 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 even more beautiful summer there were also some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 rule changes including these 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 smaller by means of without any far 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 a game as a goalkeeper is influenced 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
 the very defender and the whole 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.980
 Of course, there must be a lot more than that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 we just have to communicate ours 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 system adjust all the opponents because of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 opponent has much more space in too 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.890
 our own defensive zone and it was 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 you come a little differently than usual 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 but of course you bring yourself and it 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.530
 then proven to be relatively fast 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 you then make that rule change for you 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.730
 now rather positive or do you say that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 not necessarily have to be 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.340
 I think that was mainly 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.260
 of course for the spectators for the fans 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 changed because it will be safe 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
 just shake more actions intensively 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.210
 happen because the players just more 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 have time and have more space too 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.570
 react and shoot and fit 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 and of that I think that's 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.049
 the thing for the spectator you have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.850
 now with timo herd and hannibal 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.250
 Weitzmann two very young becks ups 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.420
 talented guys behind you like what 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 Can you help them? What can you do? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.150
 learn from you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 I have a good relationship with the team 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 very good relationship how can you already 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 times the basic conditions under 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.689
 pimping and of course in training 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.630
 Timo now and then when he needs the tips 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 Of course they will like which and and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.970
 We think we push each other in 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.470
 training is always good for you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.700
 Competition is always important 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.290
 there are actually any 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.640
 Agreed how many games do you play in this 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.600
 season will deny and how much 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.250
 his two colleagues 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.070
 Well, we did not talk about that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.990
 becomes 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.030
 Let's see what this brings 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.630
 how it starts and everything else becomes 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.040
 then the french lady is coming yet 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 to the upcoming sensors what is the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 but it is infectious how far this year 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.830
 Of course we want to playoffs 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.450
 come that is our main goal and 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.920
 the placement is, of course, on the one hand 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.440
 important of home advantage in the playoffs 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 but I do not have any 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 exact ideas is the most important 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.780
 just that you stay injury free 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.850
 during the season we have the playoffs 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.640
 come and then at the right time 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.650
 a start a fachraum and and that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 just try to have it then 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.800
 Next week we finally start with 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 the punktspielen handball against 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 Crimmitschau on sunday in Bad Nauheim 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.760
 what do you expect from the first weekend? 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.530
 it will certainly fun games because the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.750
 preparation is 1 and the main round 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 something different and will definitely different 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.120
 to go to the point 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.739
 there is always so fun with it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.080
 but is or serious tanner is about 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.550
 the points and the first league and there 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.030
 is fought for every centimeter and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.530
 I believe that the weekend 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.370
 pointing the way is for us yes as 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.370
 thanks a lot
