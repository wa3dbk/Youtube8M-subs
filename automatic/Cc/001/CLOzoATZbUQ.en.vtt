00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.850
 yes you just asked such a question 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.120
 what is my attitude to death then 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.969
 eat i can tell i'm not afraid of death 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.460
 But the reason for this is , firstly, that I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.650
 had the experience directly experience 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 when here itself outside the body here and again 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.640
 hallucinations it was there for me and not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 hallucinations this thing 5 no on this 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.449
 frankly poher deep 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 that's why because it was 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.570
 certain experience that is, this experience gave 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.180
 subjective that's how yes except here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 me here this here is my experience i 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.190
 emphasizes the moment did not see anyone 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 more that is, but no one saw what 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 I saw and did not feel not worried 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.730
 how could it be but yes how do you say 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.050
 yes funny as it is funny yes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.140
 funny 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.570
 this is my experience here it is somehow 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.030
 very smoothly falls on the common world 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.010
 experience in these matters begins 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.520
 studies here are borderline states 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.369
 same your blog here and those 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.909
 moments which is described there and the most 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 monroe 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 Robik man grew them 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 you like books, but there are other 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 comrades and the same magician michael newton 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.850
 when I described this one was killed 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 winlive 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.790
 that is, in general, that's here somehow it 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.729
 here so here and it turns out that he 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.880
 the subjective experience that I experienced he 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 has a strikingly reliable 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.240
 repeatability with other subjective 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.970
 experiences that others experience 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.550
 who went through this state 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 Here and from this I do for myself 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.340
 but let's say so certain conclusions about 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.149
 that I'm not just a piece of meat there 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 we live there bones 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.680
 here they are what more it gives me 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.840
 certain stability that is and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.429
 the most important thing is the absence of his fear 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.100
 of death 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.130
 that is, I am not afraid of death but for all 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 at the same time it means that you need to understand that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.650
 people there think well, too, there is such 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 an illusion that a person who is not afraid 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.750
 death is such a reckless brave man 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 which should go to the stuntman 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.370
 tear off your head there 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.280
 that is, but tear off and throw the boys 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.070
 there girl whose nothing why 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 because in body embedded 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.380
 biological defense mechanisms 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.380
 and here I can say so the body 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.500
 afraid of death 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.519
 yes but when you go through these experiences 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.620
 death experiences you start with 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.239
 Surprised for myself discovered just such 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.799
 for a very interesting phenomenon that is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.500
 you come to this line 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.840
 and the body for some moment is afraid 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.100
 do n't you understand it's not your fear 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 it is the fear of the body that is this fear 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.060
 which is so clear 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.810
 defined as here is the fear of the body and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.319
 such thoughts arise 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.090
 that is, and I can describe them as a country 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.389
 is amazing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.519
 hands kirdyk shorter base is not here 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.000
 let's watch how will 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.060
 kirdyk 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.180
 that is, how it will all happen well 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.489
 how interesting is the body afraid that is and straight 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.530
 here you are watching as if from 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.359
 this body is afraid but then at some point 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.310
 lost even this body is afraid to 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.290
 known limit here then not she 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.449
 ceases to be afraid and how would you 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:55.379
 I deliver that I understand that now 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:55.379
 that is, as it were, but such appears 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:03.849
 calm appears certain in 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.819
 life because you need to rearrange 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.530
 pothole i mean since here's a pothole 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.299
 some comrades there who are also on 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.909
 consultation came to me there oh 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.389
 i'm lying there and if i die and if there 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.220
 this is what you are going through all this 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.639
 passed there for example through this 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.820
 states there are eco decay but when here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.830
 there i'm denis burhaev suddenly it start 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.060
 disintegrating about soup falling apart to 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.159
 rotting meat that is 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.180
 the door you are no longer denis thump and 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:41.139
 and not at all denis and in general are you a person 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.680
 that is, if you are not a person, then someone 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.360
 there and you realize that you do not have the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.320
 there is no longer denis bruch him 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.590
 but there is someone who is aware of himself and 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.360
 I understand, but here it is at this moment and 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:01.270
 I understand that this substance is indestructible 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.190
 that is , it continues to roll on you 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.960
 another round of fear what if 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.770
 this substance will disintegrate 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.300
 creates my self further 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 logical cognitive schemes fall apart 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.139
 there's something you completely aware of 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.310
 perceived the world there perception filters 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.560
 yours 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.050
 it starts to rot and fall apart 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.180
 past your eyes completely 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.479
 falling apart and if it fell apart 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.960
 I must stop being aware of myself. 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.300
 what a garbage and I keep creating myself 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.569
 then who 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 and how to say this when and through it 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.360
 pass then you begin to understand what 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.630
 damn substance then it is some very 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.139
 sly gray and his name was like 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.650
 is said 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:58.860
 Well, it turns out to be calm 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:02.069
 so in the end everything will return except bees 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.139
 This is not crap that is, I say it again 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.600
 quite the opposite appears 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.790
 mindfulness of life responsibility 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 life as it is before itself and before it 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.810
 world here and 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.030
 how to say disappear here momentary 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.490
 some needs here is such a garbage 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.090
 there but hang out there I don't know where else 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.040
 there is something there is this husk 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.680
 earn here grab that is well here 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.560
 that shit she all disappears why 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.450
 because you understand that 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.010
 there it will not take and with you 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.120
 only what you really stay 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.190
 that's accumulated indestructible that is my 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.310
 awareness as if its understanding there 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:54.020
 life as if it has its own some here 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:07:02.660
 such victor aspirations are emotional 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:06.220
 the state of the wolf is something like this but it is 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.220
 on many respects
