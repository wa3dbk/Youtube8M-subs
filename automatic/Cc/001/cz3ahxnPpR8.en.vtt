so<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> few<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> we've<00:01:00.480> actually

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so we have a few that we've actually

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.060 
so we have a few that we've actually
recorded<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> device<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:03.830> now<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
recorded to the device here now we can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
recorded to the device here now we can
see<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> closest<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.270> apparently<00:01:07.189> stinky

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
see the closest one is apparently stinky

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
attempted to find this cache now we can

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
attempted to find this cache now we can
actually<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.719> through<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> note<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.250> we

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
actually go through and note that we

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
actually go through and note that we
found<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.630> haven't<00:02:06.840> found<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
found it we can say we haven't found it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
found it we can say we haven't found it
we<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.069> say<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> cache<00:02:09.479> needs

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
we can say that the cache needs

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
we can say that the cache needs
maintenance<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
maintenance so if the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
maintenance so if the
if<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.120> Tupperware<00:02:12.659> container<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.379> broken

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
if the Tupperware container is broken

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.699 
if the Tupperware container is broken
down<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.540> cache<00:02:15.840> itself<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.409> falling

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
down and the cache itself is falling

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.470 
down and the cache itself is falling
apart<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.129> can<00:02:17.159> we<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.670> note<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:17.849> here<00:02:18.330> we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
apart we can we can note that here we

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.470 
apart we can we can note that here we
can<00:02:18.870> also<00:02:19.019> enter<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.349> note<00:02:19.620> about<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.730> about

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
can also enter a note about the about

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.740 
can also enter a note about the about
the<00:02:21.540> experience<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.500> finding<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.890> cache<00:02:23.750> now

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the experience of finding the cache now

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.910 
the experience of finding the cache now
all<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.019> stuff<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:25.349> be<00:02:25.440> uploaded<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
all this stuff will be uploaded to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.280 
all this stuff will be uploaded to
geocaching<00:02:26.819> comm<00:02:27.209> when<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.810> connect

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
geocaching comm when we actually connect

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.720 
geocaching comm when we actually connect
to<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.500> service<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.069> can't<00:02:32.250> actually<00:02:32.400> use

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
to that service so we can't actually use

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.350 
to that service so we can't actually use
the<00:02:33.000> device<00:02:33.269> as<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.280> dedicated<00:02:35.790> GPS<00:02:36.090> if

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the device as a just a dedicated GPS if

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.140 
the device as a just a dedicated GPS if
we<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.489> we'll<00:02:38.730> need<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.000> go

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
we want to to do that we'll need to go

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.430 
we want to to do that we'll need to go
into<00:02:39.540> either<00:02:40.079> waypoints<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.040> into<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> maps

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
into either waypoints or into the maps

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.869 
into either waypoints or into the maps
here<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.310> our<00:02:47.430> current<00:02:47.640> location

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
here so we can see our current location

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.580 
here so we can see our current location
we're<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.540> we're<00:02:48.870> actually<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> studio

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
we're not we're actually in the studio

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.530 
we're not we're actually in the studio
so<00:02:49.859> it's<00:02:49.890> having<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.609> hard<00:02:50.730> time<00:02:50.849> finding<00:02:51.239> our

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so it's having a hard time finding our

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.559 
so it's having a hard time finding our
actual<00:02:51.810> location<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.390> if

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
actual location but we can use it if

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.270 
actual location but we can use it if
you've<00:02:54.690> ever<00:02:54.810> used<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.230> Magellan<00:02:55.620> GPS<00:02:56.040> or

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
you've ever used a Magellan GPS or

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
you've ever used a Magellan GPS or
really<00:02:56.519> any<00:02:56.670> handheld<00:02:57.150> GPS<00:02:57.569> they<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:57.959> work

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
really any handheld GPS they all work

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
really any handheld GPS they all work
pretty<00:02:58.260> much<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> same<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.849> see<00:03:00.060> our

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
pretty much the same we can see our

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.349 
pretty much the same we can see our
basic<00:03:01.440> location<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> map<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.209> can

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
basic location here on the map we can

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.990 
basic location here on the map we can
navigate<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> new<00:03:04.109> point<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.430> click<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
navigate to a new point we can click to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.390 
navigate to a new point we can click to
to<00:03:06.840> say<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.260> want<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> set<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.829> waypoint

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
to say that we want to set a waypoint

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.530 
to say that we want to set a waypoint
and<00:03:09.239> do<00:03:09.390> these<00:03:09.510> kinds<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.870> things<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:14.540> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and do these kinds of things here so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.699
