00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hello and welcome 2 020 Emilio this time it's about the topic of play 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.880
 Jahnsdorf Eugen Euro 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.950
 that is quite simply said it just appeared to play only from the left 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.809
 on the right and from the left on the left according to the situation 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.989
 and shoots everything about the pile was thrown 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 each of the two playable figures Thielemann wants 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.239
 strange name York 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.360
 around each one he has at 51 figures 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.710
 a special weapon blood has an end 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 blue sky more radiant 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.090
 Natalie another of his skilled work 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 Ferret counterpart 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.080
 a kind of 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.020
 Machine gun cars Rotenburg Ad Fulda 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.710
 Ammunition will be exchanged between these three types of ammunition 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 should they finally come forward that I'm in distress training and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.520
 Runs out of ammunition 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.390
 As you can see, it's on the way to rummage through the schools Poster Explosion 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
 about explosions about explosion over even more explosions 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.030
 while the pigs came across relatively templates also have some bad luck 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.550
 Also looking a little more hits expires the development teams 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.730
 Customer advisor of glazed rowing 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.160
 the energy is percentage increase 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.730
 full of energy per level 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.790
 the hacker is all over the thing you've done section 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.770
 formally share some sections with them, so to speak 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.860
 If you go you need to be with the states you are on the edge percent 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 saved for the section 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.100
 he plays is crammed with gusts blowing between Boston Beer kids 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 mostly because the top right instead of the point is now a life energy 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.510
 Buyten 5 on a picture leads 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.350
 and here's a wonderful example of a cutscene 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.300
 this relatively helpless 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 The Solinger such kilos are often told quickly 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.320
 The Bundle we are also with the Hauptschule the Liechtenstein ones 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.640
 to have 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 Ideas must prevent that and so on and so forth 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.939
 in general that there is a listener leaning on the whole team needs more 3 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.570
 4 It was also about the many Stages in Kirn wanted to take over 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.000
 big destroyer 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 general 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.600
 Eugen Jost is never inspired by the original of that time 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.379
 many parents are alluding to the eldest son, for example, there are often 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 the MBR a-class small village 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.419
 or a mind smears along with similar trend goes that is a 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.269
 It's a pity, because that's not what it's all about 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.069
 how the sea was Collina 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.680
 does that 1 2 was supplemented by Elke Fischer as maybe me in Gentiles 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.219
 here is now a small post fight to be a small 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.149
 Of course it is a little bit run 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.149
 the boss battles 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.379
 Canton subtle Chelios are quite demanding 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.509
 with the 7 Drost opponents 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.139
 gigantomaniac robots and the beast 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.060
 he is the first boss, it still comes through the big currencies 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 although she is not tall 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.759
 Mostly they are fast transparent 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.010
 In addition, the ORF plays at Alzey 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.999
 because they are often quite demanding 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.639
 foreign roots the Marbecker also excluded the official 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.209
 for her address there is more game 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.790
 See you in Yemen 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.049
 on every first ball from quite informal ajar 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.009
 forest section 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.679
 he has been freshened up clearly the favorite flower time in 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.679
 The Gases Division is dancing and can do a lot more 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.779
 and also the opposing gate to the nonsense is lost to us 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.159
 the turkey acts there as said after every armed board appeared again 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.429
 By the way, energy for hits collects the turnaround 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.759
 time-out 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.039
 and if the media is full accordingly you can unload a super shot 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.539
 the themes like Messi in the picture 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.059
 So another development of a mobile phone he is angry between 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:57.969
 Also, connoisseurs of the original should be well-known rhythmic in principle 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.969
 the same Moon a lot that so often 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.879
 Imagine you are pushing such a goal? "she plays 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.659
 Demonstration purposes maybe 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.659
 Miro is not a master dying 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.329
 except special features are small varied section so so 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.399
 You just see it that way because principle is that's always there 

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.319
 but still 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.249
 not so two stages built the b-minor sonate circular section 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.169
 Bohmann has to pick up chicks 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.820
 and to bring 7 to an end he will express that in the future 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.819
 Has been presented chicks are heartfelt on 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.199
 you have to hand them all in one go, you can also do it to and 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.580
 after one but because he has another is one can hit the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.160
 Cydia is completely seen in Seefeld the initiator has beautiful 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.249
 there are other reasons for such in June sections for example 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.360
 Put one percent down on a helicopter 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.979
 makes summa quarter shooter Dulig 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.900
 where you stand up to a good cook and shoot 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.950
 or you bow 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.150
 again in line with the old quite so Lyons by a mine the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.449
 diligent with a professional karall solution bow 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.449
 wear but a kind is now 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.089
 a cooler all around 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.520
 1970's the action it quite clearly Procap agrees too 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.090
 However, one keeps surprisingly strong the controllerless woman Sophie on the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.229
 Table April too 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.439
 Vollath is whole with explosions 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.710
 One keeps track of them too 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.710
 usually the control over the whole happened 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.349
 the whole thing is presented so bombastic 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.349
 but the graphics alone are plentifully small 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.909
 a special kind of ban or so the best graphic has it on everyone 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.909
 Case among others on the Gameboy go to war 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.039
 the Hagener so that the game time is over two hours is the adventure 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.039
 already over again and one has in the last post post kicked in the butt 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.379
 Thanks to highscore list it is then to fall should not be underestimated 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.759
 Four are suddenly playing two characters 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.759
 three difficulty programs start 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.280
 and how you do not see her here 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 Philipp Petzschner 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.409
 also here again 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.889
 what to test nice Christmas in between 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.660
 which was not a haggling is, however, more celebrity disappearing methods 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.659
 often a few soldiers are the same 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.469
 Sullivan now again a boss fight dance dealer in Boston's armor 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.289
 their bosses view are also very varied 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.810
 The one used here can be up to seven of the Touran warnings of about three 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.080
 or four program 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.039
 and thus bring with a lot of variety 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.290
 all posts would have to 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.729
 By the way, know again 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.729
 if not again 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.399
 the consumption behavior completely different should therefore no surprise 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.430
 my conclusion 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.960
 very subtle Chelios 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.259
 that's really a nice co-op NATO Rinal Rotter that's why it is 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.719
 were even better 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:24.589
 however, it is open 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.139
 it sounds bombastically staged 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.139
 It's always fun. It's always good for in between 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:34.529
 and so partly called hard it is actually 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:42.259
 It is also a bit like this coat of arms combine that the old 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.599
 but we knew everything 

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:47.710
 with the extended weapons is also pretty nice 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.409
 so on recommendation 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.149
 clearly 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.849
 Thanks for watching and having fun walking
