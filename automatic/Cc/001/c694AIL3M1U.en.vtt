able to import and recognize these files
let<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.170> give<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.470> an<00:00:22.650> example<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.180> were<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
let me give you an example if I were to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
let me give you an example if I were to
bring<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:25.740> files<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.369> example

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
bring up one of these files for example

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240 
bring up one of these files for example
I<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> video<00:00:27.330> file<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> boat<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.380> you'll

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I have a video file on a boat and you'll

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.900 
I have a video file on a boat and you'll
see<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:30.510> happens<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.199> it

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
see here that what happens is that it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.510 
see here that what happens is that it
exports<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.180> your<00:00:33.329> camcorder<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.230> dot<00:00:34.739> mts

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
exports from your camcorder a dot mts

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
exports from your camcorder a dot mts
file<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:37.350> problem<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:39.050> Camtasia<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
file and the problem is that Camtasia is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520 
file and the problem is that Camtasia is
not<00:00:41.160> able<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> recognize<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.450> video<00:00:43.290> file

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
not able to recognize this video file

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.700 
not able to recognize this video file
format<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> need<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
format and so what you need to do is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.630 
format and so what you need to do is
that<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.850> convert<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.780> file<00:00:49.200> into

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
that you have to convert this file into

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.340 
that you have to convert this file into
a<00:00:50.930> file<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.440> will<00:00:52.559> recognize<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.579> Camtasia

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
a file that will recognize with Camtasia

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
a file that will recognize with Camtasia
now<00:00:55.350> let<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.620> show<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> works<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.760> if

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
now let me show you how this works so if

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
now let me show you how this works so if
I<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> Camtasia<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> import

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
I go to Camtasia and I go to import

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
I go to Camtasia and I go to import
media<00:01:00.719> you'll<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> my

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
media you'll see here that if I go to my

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
media you'll see here that if I go to my

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
videos and you'll see that inside this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
videos and you'll see that inside this
test<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.939> there's<00:01:06.119> actually<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> video<00:01:06.750> in
