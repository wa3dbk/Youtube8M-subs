to<00:00:04.560> prepare<00:00:05.100> our<00:00:05.370> perennials<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.600> winter

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
to prepare our perennials for the winter

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.350 
to prepare our perennials for the winter
now<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.250> gorgeous<00:00:08.820> blooms<00:00:09.150> all

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
summer long and by the end of the fall

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549 
summer long and by the end of the fall
it<00:00:12.150> starts<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> freeze<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.290> bit<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.500> you

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it starts to freeze a little bit if you

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
it starts to freeze a little bit if you
live<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> colder<00:00:14.250> climate<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.849> everything

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
live in a colder climate and everything

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.320 
live in a colder climate and everything
just<00:00:15.480> looks<00:00:15.719> trashed<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:17.100> how<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.970> prepare

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
just looks trashed so how do you prepare

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
just looks trashed so how do you prepare
your<00:00:18.750> perennials<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.650> winter<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.039> what

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
your perennials for the winter and what

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.320 
your perennials for the winter and what
should<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.939> them

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
should you do with them

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.560 
should you do with them
first<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.760> my<00:00:23.760> theory<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.420> my

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
first of all my theory with all my

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
first of all my theory with all my
plants<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.199> bits<00:00:25.410> green<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.890> lush<00:00:26.070> leave<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
plants is bits green and lush leave it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
plants is bits green and lush leave it
be<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.210> brown<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.720> ratty<00:00:27.900> cut<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
be if it's brown or ratty cut it out so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
be if it's brown or ratty cut it out so
the<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:30.060> prepare<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the first thing I do is prepare them for

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
the first thing I do is prepare them for
winter<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.260> cut<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> brown

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
winter it's cut out all the brown

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.520 
winter it's cut out all the brown
material<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> garden<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> lot

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
material and if it's in the garden a lot

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.690 
material and if it's in the garden a lot
of<00:00:34.620> times<00:00:34.739> I'll<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.890> leave<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:35.399> as

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of times I'll just leave it there as

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
of times I'll just leave it there as
compost<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.020> containers<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
compost but in my containers I like to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
compost but in my containers I like to
actually<00:00:38.520> cut<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.090> anything<00:00:39.540> that's<00:00:39.899> brown

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
actually cut out anything that's brown

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
actually cut out anything that's brown
and<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.530> looking<00:00:40.920> good<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.180> doesn't

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and not looking good because it doesn't

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
and not looking good because it doesn't
look<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> winter<00:00:43.620> time<00:00:44.399> it'll

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
look good and by the winter time it'll

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.750 
look good and by the winter time it'll
turn<00:00:44.969> mushy<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> remember<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.489> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
turn mushy and then I remember this is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
turn mushy and then I remember this is
my<00:00:48.000> strelitzia<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.140> bird<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> paradise<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
my strelitzia or my bird of paradise and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.689 
my strelitzia or my bird of paradise and
it<00:00:50.940> does<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.840> cold<00:00:52.350> cold<00:00:52.829> winters<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it does not like cold cold winters and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
it does not like cold cold winters and
it<00:00:53.820> won't<00:00:54.030> even<00:00:54.239> survive<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.930> greenhouse

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it won't even survive in my greenhouse

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
it won't even survive in my greenhouse
because<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> gets<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
because if it gets even a little bit of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
because if it gets even a little bit of
frost<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.199> ends<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> leaves<00:00:59.789> will

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
frost the ends of the leaves will

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.430 
frost the ends of the leaves will
actually<00:01:00.390> curl<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.079> even<00:01:01.350> getting

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
actually curl up and I'm even getting

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
actually curl up and I'm even getting
concerned<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.430> probably<00:01:02.579> 40<00:01:03.059> degrees

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
concerned now it's probably 40 degrees

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
concerned now it's probably 40 degrees
and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.960> hating<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and I know it's hating it right now and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
and I know it's hating it right now and
I<00:01:05.729> should<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> house<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> treat

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I should put it in the house so I treat

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
I should put it in the house so I treat
it<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> house<00:01:07.920> plant<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> wintertime<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it as a house plant for the wintertime I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
it as a house plant for the wintertime I
don't<00:01:10.170> even<00:01:10.290> try<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.250> exotic<00:01:11.700> plants

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
don't even try to put my exotic plants

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
don't even try to put my exotic plants
outside<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> greenhouse<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.439> even<00:01:14.010> cover

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
outside in the greenhouse or even cover

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.179 
outside in the greenhouse or even cover
them<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.180> very

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
them up if they're very very

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.170 
them up if they're very very
temperamental<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.850> bring<00:01:18.030> them

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
temperamental then I will bring them

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
temperamental then I will bring them
inside<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.869> even<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.320> leave<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> little

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
inside and even if I leave them a little

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
inside and even if I leave them a little
bit<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> dry<00:01:20.369> side<00:01:20.460> give<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.119> water

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
bit on the dry side give them some water

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
bit on the dry side give them some water
but<00:01:21.930> leave<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> laundry<00:01:22.830> room<00:01:22.860> they

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but leave them in the laundry room they

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
but leave them in the laundry room they
seem<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.880> well<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
seem to do really well I have a little

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480 
seem to do really well I have a little
window<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.560> sometimes<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
window there and they sometimes get a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.679 
window there and they sometimes get a
little<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:26.729> beat<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.270> least<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.540> could

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
little bit beat up but at least I could

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.080 
little bit beat up but at least I could
save<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.130> you've<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.460> plants<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
save them so if you've got plants that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.569 
save them so if you've got plants that
are<00:01:30.299> annuals<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> petunia<00:01:32.220> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
are annuals like this petunia it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
are annuals like this petunia it's
really<00:01:32.939> probably<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> come<00:01:33.930> back

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
really probably not going to come back

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
really probably not going to come back
no<00:01:34.259> matter<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.850> left<00:01:36.150> them

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
no matter what I do but I have left them

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
no matter what I do but I have left them
in<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.509> greenhouse<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.470> few<00:01:37.770> times<00:01:37.979> they

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in my greenhouse and a few times they

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
in my greenhouse and a few times they
have<00:01:38.430> survived<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> same<00:01:40.079> deal<00:01:40.350> if

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
have survived so with the same deal if

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.160 
have survived so with the same deal if
it<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.799> brown<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.729> green<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.030> looks<00:01:42.780> ratty

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it looks brown or green or looks ratty

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.499 
it looks brown or green or looks ratty
in<00:01:43.409> any<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:44.970> chopping<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
in any way then I just start chopping it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.760 
in any way then I just start chopping it
out<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.159> easy<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
out and it's easy to do and a lot of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620 
out and it's easy to do and a lot of
times<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> still<00:01:50.880> blooming<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
times too if it's still blooming I just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
times too if it's still blooming I just
have<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> hardest<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.649> chopping<00:01:53.430> anything

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
have a hardest time chopping anything

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.060 
have a hardest time chopping anything
that's<00:01:54.600> dying<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.470> thrown<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.979> my

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that's dying so that thrown this in my

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.170 
that's dying so that thrown this in my
greenhouse<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.939> getting<00:01:57.119> pretty

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
greenhouse it's actually getting pretty

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
greenhouse it's actually getting pretty
cold<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> greenhouse<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.649> plant<00:01:58.920> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
cold in the greenhouse and this plant is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
cold in the greenhouse and this plant is
not<00:01:59.100> liking<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.689> there's<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.020> some

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
not liking that but there's still some

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
not liking that but there's still some
flowers<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.430> I'm<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.820> going

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
flowers on it so I think I'm just going

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
flowers on it so I think I'm just going
to<00:02:03.030> trim<00:02:03.210> off<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> dead<00:02:03.899> flowers<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to trim off all the dead flowers for a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490 
to trim off all the dead flowers for a
dead<00:02:05.009> growth<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:06.180> I'll<00:02:06.630> come<00:02:06.930> back<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
dead growth and then I'll come back in a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529 
dead growth and then I'll come back in a
few<00:02:07.740> weeks<00:02:07.890> probably<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> rest<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
few weeks probably and the rest of it

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300 
few weeks probably and the rest of it
will<00:02:09.629> die<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:10.500> I'll<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.830> ahead<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
will die down and then I'll go ahead and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.610 
will die down and then I'll go ahead and
I<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:11.970> cut<00:02:12.270> off<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.450> rest<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> flowers

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
I will cut off the rest of the flowers

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.970 
I will cut off the rest of the flowers
in<00:02:13.709> any

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
in any

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
in any
that's<00:02:14.280> brown<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.959> ground

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that's brown all the way to the ground

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.559 
that's brown all the way to the ground
even<00:02:16.409> sometimes<00:02:17.310> my<00:02:17.519> animals<00:02:17.940> will<00:02:18.090> even<00:02:18.390> come

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
even sometimes my animals will even come

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
even sometimes my animals will even come
back<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.409> always<00:02:19.590> worth<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.190> effort<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
back so it's always worth the effort to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.399 
back so it's always worth the effort to
either<00:02:21.060> throw<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> garage<00:02:21.659> or<00:02:22.230> throw

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
either throw it in the garage or throw

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.520 
either throw it in the garage or throw
it<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.129> basement<00:02:23.580> or<00:02:23.730> even<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it in the basement or even in the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.780 
it in the basement or even in the
greenhouse<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.459> just<00:02:26.489> let

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
greenhouse if you have one and just let

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.539 
greenhouse if you have one and just let
it<00:02:26.819> survive<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.390> winter<00:02:27.659> in<00:02:27.989> my<00:02:28.650> outside<00:02:29.220> beds

I cover all of my perennial beds with

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.520 
flowerbeds and that way all the weeds
die<00:02:40.650> down<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.510> leaves<00:02:42.989> break<00:02:43.319> down

bag<00:03:05.099> or<00:03:05.400> I'll<00:03:05.519> just<00:03:05.670> throw<00:03:05.819> them<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bag or I'll just throw them in the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.280 
bag or I'll just throw them in the
greenhouse<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.420> leave<00:03:06.690> them<00:03:06.810> dry<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
greenhouse and leave them dry for the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.539 
greenhouse and leave them dry for the
winter<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:07.769> put<00:03:07.920> them<00:03:08.040> out<00:03:08.129> again<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
winter and then put them out again the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.400 
winter and then put them out again the
next<00:03:08.790> year<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.239> there's<00:03:09.810> lots<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.200> ways<00:03:10.349> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
next year so there's lots of ways that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.960 
next year so there's lots of ways that
you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.829> help<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.160> perennials<00:03:11.609> through<00:03:11.879> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you can help your perennials through the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.539 
you can help your perennials through the
winter<00:03:12.239> never<00:03:13.049> fertilize<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:14.069> with

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
winter never fertilize them with

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.610 
winter never fertilize them with
nitrogen<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> fall<00:03:15.750> because<00:03:16.079> that'll<00:03:16.440> get

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
nitrogen in the fall because that'll get

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.809 
nitrogen in the fall because that'll get
new<00:03:16.829> growth<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.579> worst<00:03:17.730> thing

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
new growth and that's the worst thing

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.849 
new growth and that's the worst thing
you<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.329> your<00:03:18.450> plants<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.319> prepare

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
you can do for your plants so to prepare

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.190 
you can do for your plants so to prepare
them<00:03:20.130> for<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.730> winter<00:03:21.030> don't<00:03:21.599> fertilize<00:03:21.840> them

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
them for the winter don't fertilize them

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.640 
them for the winter don't fertilize them
at<00:03:22.349> all<00:03:22.650> after<00:03:23.250> mid<00:03:23.549> summer<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.180> even<00:03:25.169> into

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
at all after mid summer and even into

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.129 
at all after mid summer and even into
early<00:03:25.950> fall<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.329> you're<00:03:27.450> gonna<00:03:27.599> fertilize

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
early fall and if you're gonna fertilize

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.839 
early fall and if you're gonna fertilize
them<00:03:28.349> give<00:03:28.560> them<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.889> phosphate<00:03:29.459> something

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
them give them a phosphate something

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.309 
them give them a phosphate something
that's<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.120> blooming<00:03:30.480> fertilizer<00:03:30.900> because

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
that's a blooming fertilizer because

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.900 
that's a blooming fertilizer because
actually<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.859> phosphates<00:03:32.340> will<00:03:32.579> help<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
actually the phosphates will help the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.739 
actually the phosphates will help the
plant<00:03:33.180> survive<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.109> winter<00:03:34.470> better
