here<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> thought<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> knockout<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
here one I thought the knockout was the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.170

think it happens early next year

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.890 
think it happens early next year
possibly<00:01:07.650> late<00:01:08.310> next<00:01:08.520> year<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.880> both<00:01:09.090> both

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

fighters<00:01:10.140> decide<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> fight<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.990> think

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
fighters decide to fight I don't think

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
fighters decide to fight I don't think
both<00:01:13.920> guys<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> fight<00:01:14.880> each<00:01:15.030> other

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
both guys want to fight each other

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.050 
both guys want to fight each other
especially<00:01:15.960> Marquez<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.640> Marquez

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
especially Marquez I don't think Marquez

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
especially Marquez I don't think Marquez
wants<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> fight<00:01:18.570> another<00:01:18.780> fight<00:01:19.049> with

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
wants to fight another fight with

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
wants to fight another fight with
Pacquiao<00:01:20.180> maybe<00:01:21.180> Pacquio<00:01:21.810> does<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
Pacquiao maybe Pacquio does but at the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.740 
Pacquiao maybe Pacquio does but at the
same<00:01:23.280> time<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.700> Paquiao<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.600> want

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
same time I think Paquiao doesn't want

same time I think Paquiao doesn't want
also<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.009> he<00:01:26.130> does<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.790> think

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
also I don't think he does I don't think

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
also I don't think he does I don't think
he<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:27.900> knows<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.799> should<00:01:29.310> be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
he I think he knows that this should be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
he I think he knows that this should be
the<00:01:29.579> last<00:01:30.320> this<00:01:31.320> should<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.500> their<00:01:31.740> last<00:01:31.920> fight

opinion I think they should close the
book<00:02:47.680> at<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:48.750> fight<00:02:49.750> number<00:02:50.019> four<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.260> don't

in my opinion but at the same time he

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.360

know<00:04:00.609> man<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.979> wish<00:04:02.979> chapter<00:04:03.519> four<00:04:03.760> would<00:04:03.970> be

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
know man it I wish chapter four would be

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.780 
know man it I wish chapter four would be
the<00:04:04.209> last<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.599> but<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.159> sure<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.430> fifth

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
the last one but I'm pretty sure a fifth

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
the last one but I'm pretty sure a fifth
fight<00:04:06.970> will<00:04:07.120> happen<00:04:08.940> simply<00:04:09.940> because

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
fight will happen simply because

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.009 
fight will happen simply because
everyone<00:04:11.620> wants<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:11.889> see<00:04:11.979> it<00:04:12.159> I<00:04:12.340> think<00:04:13.299> at<00:04:13.690> this

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
everyone wants to see it I think at this

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.649 
everyone wants to see it I think at this
point<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.699> think<00:04:15.699> a<00:04:15.970> fifth<00:04:16.239> fight<00:04:16.479> between

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
point I think a fifth fight between

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.330 
point I think a fifth fight between
Pacquiao<00:04:17.199> and<00:04:17.349> Marquez<00:04:17.680> who<00:04:17.829> would<00:04:17.919> even<00:04:18.039> sell

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
Pacquiao and Marquez who would even sell

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.120 
Pacquiao and Marquez who would even sell
more<00:04:18.549> than<00:04:19.019> Pacquiao<00:04:20.019> mayweather<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.829> my

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
more than Pacquiao mayweather in my

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.129 
more than Pacquiao mayweather in my
opinion<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:22.389> a<00:04:22.539> lot<00:04:22.779> of<00:04:22.810> people<00:04:22.900> are

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
opinion because a lot of people are

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
entertaining that's for sure but chapter

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.040 
entertaining that's for sure but chapter
four<00:04:52.720> was<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> good<00:04:53.170> ending<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:54.150> i<00:04:56.070> don't<00:04:57.070> know

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.290 
four was a good ending and i don't know
like<00:04:59.050> i<00:04:59.200> said<00:04:59.430> this<00:05:00.430> fight<00:05:00.700> would<00:05:00.850> probably

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
like i said this fight would probably

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.730 
like i said this fight would probably
sell<00:05:01.540> more<00:05:01.570> than<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.110> neighbor<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.560> fight

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
sell more than the neighbor to fight

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.340 
sell more than the neighbor to fight
today<00:05:03.210> simply<00:05:04.210> because<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.630> lot<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:04.900> people<00:05:04.960> are

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
number that the gate like how much they

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.760 
number that the gate like how much they
got<00:05:20.290> in<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.680> gate<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.810> gate<00:05:23.020> results<00:05:23.650> was

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
like 10 million dollars 10 million plus

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.190 
like 10 million dollars 10 million plus
that's<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.770> lot<00:05:27.390> I'm<00:05:28.390> pretty<00:05:28.690> sure<00:05:28.900> the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
that's a lot I'm pretty sure the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.920 
that's a lot I'm pretty sure the
pay-per-view<00:05:29.650> numbers<00:05:30.070> will<00:05:30.220> be<00:05:30.250> really<00:05:30.610> good

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
pay-per-view numbers will be really good

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.990 
pay-per-view numbers will be really good
probably<00:05:31.930> one<00:05:32.260> point<00:05:32.650> definitely<00:05:33.490> more<00:05:33.970> than

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
probably one point definitely more than

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.030 
probably one point definitely more than
a<00:05:34.150> million<00:05:34.420> probably<00:05:35.260> like<00:05:35.440> one<00:05:35.620> point<00:05:35.860> three

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
a million probably like one point three

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.990 
a million probably like one point three
or<00:05:36.550> four<00:05:36.970> maybe<00:05:37.630> in<00:05:37.930> 1.2<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.470> don't<00:05:38.740> know<00:05:39.000> but

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
or four maybe in 1.2 I don't know but

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.820 
or four maybe in 1.2 I don't know but
I'm<00:05:40.090> pretty<00:05:40.210> sure<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.750> fair<00:05:41.140> fight<00:05:41.350> would<00:05:41.590> sell

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
I'm pretty sure a fair fight would sell

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.200 
I'm pretty sure a fair fight would sell
a<00:05:41.860> lot<00:05:42.010> more<00:05:42.190> simply<00:05:42.610> because<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.910> lot<00:05:43.180> of

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
a lot more simply because a lot of

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.780 
a lot more simply because a lot of
