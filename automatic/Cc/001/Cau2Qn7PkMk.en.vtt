00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
every now and then I like to mix it up a

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.030 
every now and then I like to mix it up a
bit<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.870> last<00:00:07.230> week<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.680> constantly

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
bit and last week I was constantly

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.459 
bit and last week I was constantly
wearing<00:00:08.550> my<00:00:08.700> hair<00:00:08.880> straight<00:00:09.240> more<00:00:09.660> often<00:00:10.050> but

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
wearing my hair straight more often but

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.129 
wearing my hair straight more often but
before<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.309> made<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> move<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.000> had<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> figure<00:00:13.049> out

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
before I made a move I had to figure out

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
before I made a move I had to figure out
which<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.099> least<00:00:14.340> damaging<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
which is the least damaging is it

to need to know a little science the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.389 
to need to know a little science the
answer<00:00:29.730> involves<00:00:30.240> bonds<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.560> James<00:00:32.040> Bond

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
answer involves bonds and not James Bond

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
answer involves bonds and not James Bond
or<00:00:32.640> Bail<00:00:33.090> Bonds<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.660> even<00:00:33.930> investment<00:00:34.500> bonds

there<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> number<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.590> bonds<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> hair

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
there are a number of bonds in the hair

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
there are a number of bonds in the hair
but<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:47.730> gonna<00:00:47.879> focus<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.390> two<00:00:48.660> hydrogen

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
but we're gonna focus on two hydrogen

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
but we're gonna focus on two hydrogen

hair chemically you're manipulating
sulfur<00:00:59.460> bonds<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.230> manipulate

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
sulfur bonds so how do we manipulate

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
sulfur bonds so how do we manipulate
these<00:01:01.949> bonds<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.290> mama

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
these bonds well you take what your mama

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
these bonds well you take what your mama
gave<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> break<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> that's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
gave you and then you break it that's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
gave you and then you break it that's
right<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.200> break<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> bond<00:01:07.860> realign<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
right you break the bond realign the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
right you break the bond realign the
protein<00:01:09.390> straight<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.439> reform<00:01:11.010> the

protein straight and then reform the

protein straight and then reform the
bond<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:12.030> breaking<00:01:12.810> bonds<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.500> a
