00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
badass it does look bad as I have to say
and<00:01:02.070> i'm<00:01:02.910> pretty<00:01:03.030> sure<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.390> gonna<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> damn

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and i'm pretty sure it's gonna be a damn

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.670 
and i'm pretty sure it's gonna be a damn
kill<00:01:04.140> streak<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:05.729> bad<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kill streak is it bad I don't know it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
kill streak is it bad I don't know it
doesn't<00:01:08.040> seem<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.610> flares<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
doesn't seem like it has flares so I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
doesn't seem like it has flares so I
guess<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.900> gonna<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.140> easy<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.439> shoot<00:01:10.619> down

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
guess it's gonna be easy to shoot down

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.710 
guess it's gonna be easy to shoot down
