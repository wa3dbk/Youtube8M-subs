00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
did not work on the verizon specific

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230 
did not work on the verizon specific
model<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.009> group<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.399> XDA<00:01:47.759> developers

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
model but a group of XDA developers

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
model but a group of XDA developers
specifically<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> looks<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.590> opes<00:01:49.770> took

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
specifically it looks like be opes took

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.319 
specifically it looks like be opes took
up<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> challenge<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.299> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
up the challenge he was the one that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
up the challenge he was the one that
really<00:01:51.450> did<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> majority<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> work<00:01:52.320> use

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
really did the majority of the work use

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
really did the majority of the work use
the<00:01:53.040> exploit<00:01:53.430> from<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:54.149> ups<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> fuses<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the exploit from be ups and fuses and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
the exploit from be ups and fuses and
the<00:01:55.170> route<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.439> j<00:01:55.740> duck<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> happen

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the route from j duck to make it happen

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
the route from j duck to make it happen
and<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.780> created<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.320> rumrunner<00:01:58.740> s

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and so they have created a rumrunner s

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
and so they have created a rumrunner s
off<00:01:59.520> for<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.329> verizon<00:02:00.719> HTC<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.890> you
