00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.020
 Or continue to practice the time the bunny hop sub-six 

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:09.020
 I will introduce the process in the reverse rotation I do not like 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:24.619
 First of all the the body can return better tempo from landing a Etty that can 1 at 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.619
 I think it might lead to a step off swing 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.580
 The next attempt is a more is than the # 1 tee 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.059
 Perhaps 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.989
 Freon from for at 1 at Once you have become larger amount could spin so than the 1 at 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 Challenge to raise the pimping soil and put it in the rear tap 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.059
 Hmm 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 Hmm 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.620
 around saburoku tire tap is likely to attract twice can was the way the front 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.620
 It is easy to grasp the goal 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.900
 It is easy to practice by being conscious of rotating by having a clone child pulling and becoming cheap 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.810
 I think 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810
 It is 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.540
 Nn 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.000
 Four days 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:18.300
 How many times did you go around with a tap with your body? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.890
 Even if you put a tap, the center of the tire, which is important for the rotation system, does not turn forward. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.810
 I can not go around smoothly 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.810
 I think that point is good because the tire is facing forward when the annual ring lands 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.569
 The tree wants to fix that side 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.730
 I 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.730
 Oh 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.180
 Hmm 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.800
 Perhaps 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.410
 Where Whoa 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.410
 heart
