00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
filming this report and in that time

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.149 
filming this report and in that time
we've<00:01:19.560> done<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:20.270> 530<00:01:21.270> miles<00:01:21.720> we've<00:01:22.710> put<00:01:22.979> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
we've done about 530 miles we've put in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
we've done about 530 miles we've put in
I<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.090> maybe<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.510> hundred<00:01:24.930> maybe<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I don't know maybe a hundred maybe a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840 
I don't know maybe a hundred maybe a
hundred<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> twenty<00:01:26.070> pounds<00:01:26.430> worth<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
hundred and twenty pounds worth of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.710 
hundred and twenty pounds worth of
petrol<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:28.049> empty<00:01:28.619> tank<00:01:28.920> start<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
petrol from an empty tank start and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
petrol from an empty tank start and
we've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.930> plenty<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> tank<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
we've got plenty in the tank now so the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.880 
we've got plenty in the tank now so the
reality<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.780> car<00:01:34.020> returns<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.590> good

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
reality is that the car returns a good

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.210 
reality is that the car returns a good
mile<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.490> gallon<00:01:35.909> figure<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.950> haven't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
mile to the gallon figure but we haven't

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
mile to the gallon figure but we haven't
done<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> test<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
done a test we don't know the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.429 
done a test we don't know the
manufacturer's<00:01:40.710> suggested<00:01:41.570> mpg<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
manufacturer's suggested mpg is that you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.760 
manufacturer's suggested mpg is that you
get<00:01:43.680> something<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.430> 67<00:01:45.360> mpg<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.290> what's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get something about 67 mpg on what's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
get something about 67 mpg on what's
called<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> combined<00:01:47.549> cycle<00:01:47.939> which<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
called the combined cycle which is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.830 
called the combined cycle which is
mixing<00:01:49.409> long<00:01:49.680> distance<00:01:50.189> runs<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.479> ten

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
mixing long distance runs with about ten

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
mixing long distance runs with about ten
work<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.950> guess<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.430> probably<00:01:53.880> true<00:01:54.150> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
work and I guess that's probably true it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
work and I guess that's probably true it
certainly<00:01:55.200> doesn't<00:01:55.500> feel<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.759> were

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
certainly doesn't feel as if we were

00:01:56.820 --> 00:03:17.500 
certainly doesn't feel as if we were
putting<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.240> lot<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.450> petrol<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.170> tank

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.569
