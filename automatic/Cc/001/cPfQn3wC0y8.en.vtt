 every room has its own club patterns 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.130
 his identity would say your fingerprint 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.860

 the so little that it is a plan out 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.040
 the same five years and that plan goes 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.590
 well trolling as maintenance evictions 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.170
 and to make the stand obscure sometimes can 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.880
 powder per project to get because 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.130

 workshops that are skilled but that is 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.050
 natural gradient is almost always 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.080
 10% of the file from my 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.360
 water 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.120

 love the dommel stress 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.260
 is there any reason you think it is 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.750
 at the end of the year that is yes 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.470
 water temperature heavily optimal perfectly 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.300
 we then 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.740
 cold water temperature to its number 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.180
 is less active 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.800
 making them easy to access 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.100
 easier to stay here and say 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.440
 Yes 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.940

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 fishermen ills 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.140
 never centered time on acclimatization 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.390
 an old right had arrived in the room 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.490
 because she knew he already pronounce ponds 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.620
 which will snap together with thousands 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.460
 grows and come now definitely here 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.930
 down 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.089

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.960
 polluted week did not start 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:54.809

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.580
 we are back from a set of 80 km roads 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.589
 Be direct 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.270

 I also mentioned that the buses had some 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.619
 really active here lingers we can 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.419
 also see, then they will lose him 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:10.349
 And then yes a question is where they are going 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.279
