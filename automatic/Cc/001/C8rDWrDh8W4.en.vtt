throwing some interest together just for

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.140 
throwing some interest together just for
fun<00:00:07.080> lately<00:00:07.319> just<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> change<00:00:08.160> things<00:00:08.460> up<00:00:08.670> so

fun lately just to change things up so
first<00:00:09.450> I'm<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> show<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> intro<00:00:10.440> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
first I'm going to show you the intro I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.499 
first I'm going to show you the intro I
did<00:00:10.769> use<00:00:11.040> which<00:00:11.460> by<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> way<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.940> want<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> tell

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
did use which by the way I want to tell

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.580 
did use which by the way I want to tell
you<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> little<00:00:12.840> reviewer<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
you the little reviewer was the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
you the little reviewer was the
cameraman<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.370> that's<00:00:14.549> why<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> little

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
cameraman so that's why I was a little

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:36.860 
cameraman so that's why I was a little
bit<00:00:15.299> shaky

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440 

here's<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> alternate<00:00:38.400> intro<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.030> decided

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
here's the alternate intro I decided

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.730 
here's the alternate intro I decided
against<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.990> because<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.260> thought<00:00:40.470> it<00:00:40.530> looked

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
against it because I thought it looked

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.070 
against it because I thought it looked
way<00:00:41.130> goofier<00:00:41.820> than<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.150> first<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
way goofier than the first one it's the

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.800 
way goofier than the first one it's the
same<00:00:43.260> basic<00:00:43.800> idea<00:00:44.060> except<00:00:45.060> I<00:00:45.210> didn't<00:00:45.540> like<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
same basic idea except I didn't like the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:01:07.520 
same basic idea except I didn't like the
pan<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.040> hope<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> enjoy<00:00:47.640> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.230 

both<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.710> these<00:01:08.799> bloopers<00:01:09.310> are<00:01:09.549> me<00:01:09.909> getting

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
both of these bloopers are me getting

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.149 
both of these bloopers are me getting
hurt<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.869> can't<00:01:11.439> believe<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:11.799> but<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:11.979> got

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
hurt and I can't believe it but I got

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.620 
hurt and I can't believe it but I got
hurt<00:01:12.340> two<00:01:12.580> different<00:01:12.940> ways<00:01:13.090> when<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.420> was

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
hurt two different ways when I was

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.420 
hurt two different ways when I was
filming<00:01:13.900> this<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.650> second<00:01:14.950> one<00:01:15.040> was<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.190> lot

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
filming this the second one was a lot

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.999 
filming this the second one was a lot
worse<00:01:15.640> though<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:16.150> destroyed<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.170> trash<00:01:17.409> can<00:01:17.710> I

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
worse though I destroyed a trash can I

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.710 
worse though I destroyed a trash can I
took<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.490> picture<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.030> trash<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:19.630> you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
took a picture of the trash can so you

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.180 
took a picture of the trash can so you
guys<00:01:19.869> could<00:01:20.049> see<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.649> ended<00:01:20.920> up<00:01:21.009> having

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
guys could see it but I ended up having

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.219 
guys could see it but I ended up having
to<00:01:21.369> throw<00:01:21.399> away<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.820> trash<00:01:22.240> can<00:01:22.570> in<00:01:22.899> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229
