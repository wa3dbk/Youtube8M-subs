00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so we're just finishing up this side of

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.079 
so we're just finishing up this side of
a<00:00:02.820> good<00:00:03.000> neighbor<00:00:03.210> fence<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:04.640> good<00:00:05.640> neighbor<00:00:05.879> it

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
a good neighbor fence a good neighbor it

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.000 
a good neighbor fence a good neighbor it
means<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.600> there's<00:00:06.870> pickets<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.470> both<00:00:07.710> sides

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
means that there's pickets on both sides

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.320 
means that there's pickets on both sides
so<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:09.530> everybody<00:00:10.530> experiences<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.940> value

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
so that everybody experiences the value

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.620 
so that everybody experiences the value
of<00:00:12.830> of<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.250> fence<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:16.670> nobody<00:00:17.670> gets<00:00:18.420> a

of of the fence and nobody gets a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
of of the fence and nobody gets a
preference<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> having<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> pickets

pickets<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.640> side<00:00:50.940> leaving<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.510> little

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
pickets on one side leaving a little

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
pickets on one side leaving a little
bigger<00:00:51.899> gap<00:00:52.550> there's<00:00:54.829> I'm<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.250> into<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bigger gap there's I'm going into the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.080 
bigger gap there's I'm going into the
bushes<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.699> side

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
bushes there now and then on this side

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.560 
bushes there now and then on this side
you<00:01:00.510> add<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.910> other<00:01:03.000> wants<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you add the other the other wants to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.679 
you add the other the other wants to
close<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> gap<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> makes<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> good

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.390 

it's<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.840> important<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.710> stop<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's also important not to stop the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's also important not to stop the
water<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> bottoms<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:15.479> water<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
water on the bottoms so the water can

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
water on the bottoms so the water can
flow<00:01:16.049> through<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> air<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.310> flow

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
flow through and the air can flow

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.560 
flow through and the air can flow
through<00:01:17.900> that's<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> faults<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
through that's one of the faults of the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.020 
through that's one of the faults of the
post<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> prefab<00:01:26.130> panels<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
post you know the prefab panels is the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
post you know the prefab panels is the
all<00:01:27.240> trap<00:01:27.540> water<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> bottom<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:30.619> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
all trap water in the bottom and that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
all trap water in the bottom and that
leaves<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:33.110> rotting<00:01:34.110> spot<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.210> very

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
leaves a rotting spot this is a very

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.039 
leaves a rotting spot this is a very
strong<00:01:37.200> fence<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.340> has<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.689> tee<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
strong fence because it has a tee on the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
strong fence because it has a tee on the
top<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.590> means<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.579> four<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> up

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
top which means one two but four is up

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
top which means one two but four is up
and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> other<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.049> across<00:01:43.649> flat<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and the other one is across flat and you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.639 
and the other one is across flat and you
put<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> Crown's<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> 2x4<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
put the Crown's up on the 2x4 like this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
put the Crown's up on the 2x4 like this
so<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> strength<00:01:52.610> supports<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> weight

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
so that the strength supports the weight

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.850 
so that the strength supports the weight
of<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> fence

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
of that fence

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
of that fence
also<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> bottom<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> down<00:01:58.729> with<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
also the bottom is up and down with the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
also the bottom is up and down with the
four<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> three<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> half<00:02:01.380> inch

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
four of three and three and a half inch

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.470 
four of three and three and a half inch
up<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.950> down

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
up and down

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.560 
up and down
and<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.490> triple<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:05.940> strength<00:02:06.090> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and that is about triple the strength of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.060 
and that is about triple the strength of
a<00:02:07.070> flat<00:02:08.070> running<00:02:09.560> board<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:13.110> our<00:02:13.410> good

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
a flat running board so that's our good

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.070 
a flat running board so that's our good

it makes usually done when people are

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.070 
it makes usually done when people are

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
each want to benefit the most they can

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.600 
each want to benefit the most they can
from<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> without<00:02:25.860> driving<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> price

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
