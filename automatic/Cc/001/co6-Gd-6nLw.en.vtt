00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.670
 hello to all of you guys then in today 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.910
 this tutorial i want to show you how 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.360
 make a very simple nail art 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.560
 but that is a lot at the same time 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:37.390
 elusive very beautiful and I must say that I 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.880
 I made it for the holidays in which in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.560
 my case for Christmas and I have to say that I have 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.660
 received many compliments 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.000
 this is where this kind of nail art is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.760
 very suitable especially because the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.720
 first weapons then in a lot of manual work 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.930
 because it is very simple 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.640
 then to whom and to the mar to use this 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.000
 nail art 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.790
 you can see where the necessary that is 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.509
 in fact they run very little 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.390
 only three enamels which are then one 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:21.460
 gold polished enamel I use this 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:25.810
 here of the debby and then I for example in the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.819
 my case I use the glaze of the peak of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.539
 but this blue you can very well 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.420
 use for example for the new year on 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.289
 red what you want leaving it 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.030
 remove the nail polish with acetone then vi 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.520
 I will show you how to do this nail art 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.569
 here it is, then I take away 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.200
 the enamel only on the thumb the index 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:56.320
 because anyway just to do it for you 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.930
 see then while we always go 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.740
 a pass of the glaze we have 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.390
 I chose in my case in the blue world 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 let's spread it on the nail 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.519
 and so proceeding on all the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.060
 other uses 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.189
 and here's small reminding us 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.099
 however of course always go to 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:39.540
 give the nail polish even on the tip 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.870
 so here on the tip of the nail in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.480
 so that in this way the enamel 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.549
 they will last longer 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.670
 well now this point we go to 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.260
 spread the glaze 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.690
 gold glitter 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:03.200
 ok so let's take our nail polish and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:08.310
 let's try to put more than anything else 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.750
 glitter and slides not so much enamel 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:23.280
 therefore we hang and then the excess of 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:28.790
 malt we send to remove and here and so 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.790
 even in the long run then we beat 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:58.700
 and then we go to remove the enamel in 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:04:01.970
 more and here is our nail art 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.160
 finished that very effective and I have to 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.450
 say that on servants I received many 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.100
 congratulations because precisely for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.790
 originality is due to its effect 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:18.830
 that from and I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.370
 I repeat that it is really suitable for 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:26.060
 those who are beginners with rain art 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.710
 however, he wants to amaze everyone 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.520
 with that it's all next time 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.730
