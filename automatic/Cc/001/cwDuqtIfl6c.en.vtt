00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
face came in real help to Arsenal and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.849 
face came in real help to Arsenal and
even<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.570> his<00:00:52.079> crosses<00:00:52.379> were<00:00:52.649> good

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859

well<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.840> argue<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.320> Sanchez<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.890> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
well you can argue when Sanchez was that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.649 
well you can argue when Sanchez was that
but<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.340> cuz<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.450> very

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
but really cuz all I was also very

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
but really cuz all I was also very
important<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.350> Arsenal<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.430> he

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
important for Arsenal and I think he

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.450 
important for Arsenal and I think he
deserves<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.030> an<00:01:33.180> 85<00:01:33.810> rated<00:01:34.259> card<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.159> well

this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> his<00:01:36.390> highest

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
this is probably going to be his highest

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
this is probably going to be his highest
rating<00:01:37.079> from<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:38.399> he's<00:01:38.549> 30

David Ospina now he didn't have that
greatest<00:01:48.990> season<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.909> 77<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
greatest season but really 77 is just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
greatest season but really 77 is just
too<00:01:51.899> low<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.170> someone<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.070> David<00:01:53.250> Ospina

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
too low for someone like David Ospina

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
we're going to be talking about is

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.100 
we're going to be talking about is
olivier<00:02:17.680> giroud<00:02:18.010> now<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.550> guy<00:02:18.820> scored<00:02:19.510> 18

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
olivier giroud now this guy scored 18

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.930 
olivier giroud now this guy scored 18
goals<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.710> season<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> think<00:02:21.610> he<00:02:21.700> doesn't

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
goals this season and I think he doesn't

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.660 
goals this season and I think he doesn't
deserve<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.390> 79<00:02:23.050> grated<00:02:23.470> card<00:02:23.710> now<00:02:23.890> he<00:02:24.310> deserves

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
deserve a 79 grated card now he deserves

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.850 
deserve a 79 grated card now he deserves
at<00:02:24.850> least<00:02:24.880> 80<00:02:25.420> he's<00:02:25.990> not<00:02:26.170> probably<00:02:26.530> one<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
at least 80 he's not probably one of the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.290 
at least 80 he's not probably one of the
world<00:02:27.100> one<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> best<00:02:27.790> strikers<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
world one of the best strikers in the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.640 
world one of the best strikers in the
more<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.570> world<00:02:28.870> class<00:02:29.140> or<00:02:29.290> something<00:02:29.410> but

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
more like world class or something but

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.620 
more like world class or something but
he's<00:02:29.740> definitely<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.430> very<00:02:30.850> good<00:02:31.090> striker<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
he's definitely a very good striker and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.200 
he's definitely a very good striker and
I<00:02:31.690> think<00:02:31.960> 80<00:02:32.200> rating<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:33.100> perfect<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> manic

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
I think 80 rating is perfect for a manic

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.090 
I think 80 rating is perfect for a manic
and<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.480> also<00:02:34.660> think<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.020> FIFA<00:02:35.290> 16<00:02:35.410> he<00:02:35.770> will<00:02:35.950> be

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
and I also think in FIFA 16 he will be

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.760 
and I also think in FIFA 16 he will be
80<00:02:36.340> rated<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.030> yeah<00:02:37.990> that's<00:02:38.110> basically<00:02:38.230> down

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
80 rated and yeah that's basically down

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.350 
80 rated and yeah that's basically down
and<00:02:38.950> hit<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.160> guy<00:02:39.310> scored<00:02:39.580> 18<00:02:39.910> goals<00:02:39.940> as<00:02:40.270> I

and hit this guy scored 18 goals as I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.150 
and hit this guy scored 18 goals as I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160 
said and you know he's a clinical
finishing<00:02:42.460> he<00:02:42.640> might<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.210> pace<00:02:43.570> he

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
finishing he might not have the pace he

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.720 
finishing he might not have the pace he
might<00:02:44.380> not<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.620> able<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.950> beat<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> defenders

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
might not be able to beat the defenders

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.280 
might not be able to beat the defenders
and<00:02:45.850> all<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.090> really<00:02:46.270> when<00:02:46.900> he<00:02:47.020> gets<00:02:47.170> his

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and all but really when he gets his

chance to score he does score and his

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.030 
chance to score he does score and his
finishes<00:02:49.600> aren't<00:02:50.170> really<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:50.890> beautiful

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.540
