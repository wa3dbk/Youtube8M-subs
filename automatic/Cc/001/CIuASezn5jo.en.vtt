00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you how I do that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
you how I do that
well<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> first<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> decide

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
well the first thing you have to decide

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
well the first thing you have to decide
on<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> type<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> washi<00:00:41.850> tape<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.180> don't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on is the type of washi tape you don't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
on is the type of washi tape you don't
want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> slice<00:00:43.290> something<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
want to slice something like this of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.799 
want to slice something like this of
course<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> cut<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
course because you're going to cut the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.040 
course because you're going to cut the
words<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.350> half<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.629> pick

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
words in half or you don't want to pick

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.420 
words in half or you don't want to pick
something<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> cupcakes

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
something like this with the cupcakes

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
something like this with the cupcakes
because<00:00:50.640> you'll<00:00:50.789> cut<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> cupcakes<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.719> half

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because you'll cut the cupcakes in half

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.049 
because you'll cut the cupcakes in half
so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so you want something like this with a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
so you want something like this with a
pattern<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.780> doesn't<00:00:55.050> matter<00:00:55.260> where<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pattern that it doesn't matter where you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.840 
pattern that it doesn't matter where you
cut<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.989> still<00:00:58.609> have<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> really

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
cut it that it will still have a really

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
cut it that it will still have a really
nice<00:01:00.059> pattern<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> said<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
nice pattern to it so like I said I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.840 
nice pattern to it so like I said I
slice<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.309> my

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
slice it and what I do is I put it on my

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
slice it and what I do is I put it on my
trimmer<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
trimmer and this one I just put in the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.440 
trimmer and this one I just put in the
middle<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.060> through<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
middle because you could see through it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.080 
middle because you could see through it
and<00:01:09.659> being<00:01:09.930> washy<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.799> lift<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> off<00:01:11.430> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and being washy you can lift it off this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.080 
and being washy you can lift it off this
metal<00:01:12.450> part<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.290> after<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.460> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
metal part really easy after so I just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
metal part really easy after so I just
take<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.780> slice<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:17.070> two

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
take that slice that and then I have two

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.499 
take that slice that and then I have two
thicker<00:01:18.090> ones<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.060> say

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
thicker ones and I will just like say

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.820 
thicker ones and I will just like say
we're<00:01:21.689> doing<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> book<00:01:22.140> I'll<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
we're doing the book I'll put it at like

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.080 
we're doing the book I'll put it at like
five<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> half<00:01:23.369> inches<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
five and a half inches and then I have a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170 
five and a half inches and then I have a
little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.390> left<00:01:24.570> over<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.939> two

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
little bit left over so there I have two

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
little bit left over so there I have two
perfectly<00:01:28.220> sliced<00:01:29.780> washi<00:01:30.780> tapes<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.560> two

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
perfectly sliced washi tapes I have two

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
perfectly sliced washi tapes I have two
pieces<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.170> because

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pieces and then what do I do because

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
pieces and then what do I do because
usually<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> cut<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.100> half<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.610> me

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
usually if you cut them in half with me

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
usually if you cut them in half with me
I<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.970> them<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> long

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I do them in three so I have a long

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
I do them in three so I have a long
strip<00:01:37.680> left<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> can

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
strip left so I don't know if you can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
strip left so I don't know if you can
see<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.040> stick<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.640> right

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
see on here but I just stick it right

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.170 
see on here but I just stick it right
back<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.030> its<00:01:42.420> roll<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
back on its roll and then I can use it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
back on its roll and then I can use it
for<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.360> next<00:01:45.600> product<00:01:45.840> project<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> that's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
for my next product project so that's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
for my next product project so that's
how<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.479> half<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.170> then

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
how I would do it in half and then

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.210 
how I would do it in half and then
depending<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.310> where<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:52.220> can

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
depending on where you put it you can

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
depending on where you put it you can
even<00:01:53.399> cut<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.880> thirds<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
even cut them in thirds because this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
even cut them in thirds because this
pink<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> lot<00:01:56.280> thicker<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.000> one

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pink one is a lot thicker than this one

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.310 
pink one is a lot thicker than this one
and<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:57.540> even<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.110> thinner

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and there's even a little bit thinner

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
and there's even a little bit thinner
ones<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.979> cut<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.549> half<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ones that I just cut in half like this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.600 
ones that I just cut in half like this
one<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.950> cut<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.250> half<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
one is one that I just cut in half and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.800 
one is one that I just cut in half and
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.759> tell<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> difference<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> size

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you can tell the difference in size

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230 
you can tell the difference in size
there<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.189> one<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.700> even<00:02:05.790> cut<00:02:06.060> in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
there so this one you can even cut in

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
there so this one you can even cut in
threes<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.810> fours<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> on

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
threes or fours so you just put it on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
threes or fours so you just put it on
you<00:02:08.039> try<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.330> make<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> nice<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> straight

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you try to make it nice and straight

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.339 
you try to make it nice and straight
nice<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.520> even<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:11.940> when<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> slice<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
nice and even so when you slice it you

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.059 
nice and even so when you slice it you
have<00:02:13.560> three

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
have three

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.489 
have three
parts<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.849> then<00:02:14.999> you<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.329> take<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.689> hat<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:16.499 
parts so then you just take the hat you

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.709 
parts so then you just take the hat you
cut<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.829> like<00:02:16.859> I<00:02:17.129> did<00:02:17.310> before<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.969> then<00:02:18.569> you

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
cut it like I did before and then you

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.599 
cut it like I did before and then you
take<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.049> off<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.739> always<00:02:19.859> want<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> do<00:02:20.579> a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
take it off and you always want to do a

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.830 
take it off and you always want to do a
little<00:02:20.819> bit<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.329> when<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.629> peel<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
little bit more because when you peel it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.239 
little bit more because when you peel it
up<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:23.209> kind<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.359> lift<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.749> edge<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.439> and

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
up you kind of lift up the edge here and

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.699 
up you kind of lift up the edge here and
then<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.329> just<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.749> this<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> can

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
then you can just take this and you can

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.289 
then you can just take this and you can
move<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.010> over<00:02:29.129> because<00:02:29.609> that's<00:02:29.879> one<00:02:30.150> thing

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
move it over because that's one thing

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.179 
move it over because that's one thing
with<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:31.079> really<00:02:31.439> neat<00:02:31.590> with<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.859> washi

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
with that's really neat with this washi

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.580 
with that's really neat with this washi
tape<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.969> its<00:02:33.659> repositionable<00:02:34.379> you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
tape is you can its repositionable you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.530 
tape is you can its repositionable you
can<00:02:34.709> keep<00:02:34.859> moving<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.219> around<00:02:35.540> that's

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
can keep moving it around that's

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.910 
can keep moving it around that's
probably<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.930> perfect<00:02:37.319> because<00:02:37.439> I'm<00:02:37.560> doing

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
probably not perfect because I'm doing

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.250 
probably not perfect because I'm doing
this<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.189> camera<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> here<00:02:39.719> out<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.079> one

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this on camera so here out of that one

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.429 
this on camera so here out of that one
piece<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:41.090> have<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:42.419> skinny<00:02:42.810> strips<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
piece I have three skinny strips and

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.379 
piece I have three skinny strips and
then<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:43.889> do<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.489> I'll<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.760> wrap<00:02:45.209> them

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
then what I do is I'll just wrap them

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.899 
then what I do is I'll just wrap them
around<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:46.079> on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.349> washi<00:02:46.590> tape<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.609> I<00:02:47.639> can

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
around here on the washi tape so I can

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.720 
around here on the washi tape so I can
use<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> again<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.599> another<00:02:48.659> project<00:02:49.469> so<00:02:50.459> there

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
use it again in another project so there

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.179 
use it again in another project so there
you<00:02:50.849> go<00:02:50.969> that's<00:02:51.299> how<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.780> slice<00:02:52.439> my<00:02:52.469> washi<00:02:52.889> tape

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
you go that's how I slice my washi tape

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.459 
you go that's how I slice my washi tape
so<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.639> nice<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:53.879> thin<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.540> straight<00:02:55.230> so

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469
