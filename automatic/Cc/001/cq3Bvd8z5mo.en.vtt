00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.200
 boys and girls 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.230
 you're going to make a dragon this afternoon 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.089
 a dragon from this one 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 at small the intention is that you are the dragon 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.430
 so one piece doesn't all matter 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 individual particles but you him 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.859
 actually squeezes out here, as it were 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.119
 and that you approximately go to the form 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.119
 you think here comes the headline 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.950
 and behind this comes the tail and one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.950
 dragon usually has a long tail 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 it is now about the basic form 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 here comes the head and I pinch the head 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 from the form not exactly true 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.250
 about 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 make sure the headline 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 nothing to do so you take it off 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.820
 he must be a little fat 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.820
 now the legs that you squeeze come out 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.850
 that you have four legs 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.500
 You can now also a form he 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.630
 maybe an offensive attack 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.680
 attitude that do that now for example 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:50.060
 by lifting the back or something 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 or a leg can be put forward so that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.470
 he so that you get the idea that that 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 moves the intention is that you him 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.040
 is going to finish 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 you begin to see if you have the form 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.450
 and if you might like something 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.450
 must take away 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:20.440
 under the dragon here you will 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.440
 probably have to remove something 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.440
 see if it is still in good condition that is 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440
 very important 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 view the dragon from different sides 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.590
 so turn the blade 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.340
 turn the blade and see how it looks 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.310
 see 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.710
 because then I see that there on this side 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.440
 what still needs to be done 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.820
 you see this is not this well 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.820
 are you going to moor 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.660
 now let's try the shape a bit 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.840
 to get in order 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.840
 the boats the claws 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.790
 and make sure that everything is well connected 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.700
 lubricated seat 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.740
 I cannot emphasize that enough 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.740
 it must be properly tightened 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.100
 well if we are a bit happy please 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.990
 mind you're all still 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:58.070
 possibly things changed 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.070
 we start with the 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.830
 back that always has dangerous of that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.830
 movie standing upright 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.690
 if necessary , you can do something about it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 chain here 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.060
 you can with this device you can too 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.060
 remove material 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.560
 now we continue to make the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.729
 to shake 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.729
 you can do that by becoming
