00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello everyone, jack x and hit today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.050
 we came up with an automatic mechanism 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.620
 building a house and begin to review it 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.450
 so that we need to activate it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 break down 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 you can replace purple clay 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 purple clay and any varnish and so 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's break hit break break and here 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.630
 lined up a house like that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 Loose blocks of any Well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.690
 let's start building it for him 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 buildings we need signs any 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 loose block and some other block 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.640
 here are loose blocks you see let's 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 take the white trade come on jake 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 marching and we'll see how 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:09.330
 arrange a lot of time on it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.890
 you don't spend building it fast so 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.750
 let's build a little 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 so as not to drag on you see jake 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:33.180
 conducts such a scheme 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:35.759
 of the plates, there is just a little bit left 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.640
 such a house turned out to be more so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:46.799
 volumetric can be any size what you 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 want to set the size do not be afraid of food 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:56.130
 but I will put here 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:01.969
 red sand hit us do not write it but 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 So we build the form of a ball more precisely at home 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.489
 cubic duku square sweat if you 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.950
 want to make the door have to take out 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.550
 something 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.370
 Well, I don't think anyone will be this 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.920
 mechanism to use survival well then 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.920
 break and voila 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.170
 sand because sand is red 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.590
 keeps on the plates and we break the block 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.320
 which holds these tablets more precisely 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.740
 where does this scheme come from the plates and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.620
 sand pair 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.280
 Well, such an easy mechanism, we tell you 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.110
 showed everyone while you were jackie x and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.110
 hit everyone bye
