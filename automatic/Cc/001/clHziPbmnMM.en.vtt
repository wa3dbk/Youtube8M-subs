for<00:01:27.420> video<00:01:27.900> games<00:01:28.160> seeing<00:01:29.160> as<00:01:29.280> though<00:01:29.460> i<00:01:29.670> would

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
for video games seeing as though i would

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
for video games seeing as though i would
think<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> video

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
think that because you know the video

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.560 
think that because you know the video
games<00:01:32.610> were<00:01:32.789> 25<00:01:33.149> bucks<00:01:34.190> from<00:01:35.190> 60<00:01:35.880> i<00:01:36.090> would

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
games were 25 bucks from 60 i would

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.609 
games were 25 bucks from 60 i would
think<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.410> bigger

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
think that there would be a bigger

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
think that there would be a bigger
demand<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.430> blu-rays<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.720> was

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
demand for that than blu-rays and i was

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320 
demand for that than blu-rays and i was

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
organized I thought it would be much

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.200 
organized I thought it would be much
worse<00:03:30.540> let's<00:03:31.020> just<00:03:31.110> leave<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.400> it

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
worse let's just leave it at that so it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.230 
worse let's just leave it at that so it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
they didn't even like wait till eight it

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.390 
they didn't even like wait till eight it
was<00:03:36.450> probably<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:37.020> quarter<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.920> eight<00:03:38.160> so

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400

why no one here's a spoiler I didn't say

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.750 
why no one here's a spoiler I didn't say
the<00:03:51.270> WWE<00:03:51.810> 13<00:03:51.990> games<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:53.130> was<00:03:53.250> like<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the WWE 13 games but it was like on the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.620 
the WWE 13 games but it was like on the
last<00:03:54.600> last<00:03:55.350> level<00:03:56.040> there<00:03:56.480> there<00:03:57.480> were<00:03:57.570> only

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
last last level there there were only

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
last last level there there were only
like<00:03:57.780> three<00:03:58.200> games<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:59.580> was<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.700> hole

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
like three games and there was a hole

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.850 
like three games and there was a hole
above<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:00.480> i<00:04:00.600> guess<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:00.930> people<00:04:01.530> just

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
above it so i guess like people just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.190 
above it so i guess like people just
went<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:02.760> there<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.090> took<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.630> couple<00:04:03.930> games

went in there and took a couple games
out<00:04:04.440> i<00:04:04.470> don't<00:04:04.620> know<00:04:04.830> but<00:04:05.520> since<00:04:06.030> i<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.270> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
out i don't know but since i was the
