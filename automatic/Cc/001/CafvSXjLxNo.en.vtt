 in my opinion that is not better costs more authentic 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 and on the other hand for health it's definitely 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.939
 as an architect and landscaper I was sensitized very early 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.359

 have been removed from commerce 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.120
 and we have sometimes seen 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 it's allergy permits things like that myself I've got them 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.579
 used 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.770
 some products 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 reuters all removed from the sale a few years later 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.020
 because it was dangerous 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.630
 and it was marketed with provisional marketing authorizations 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.650
 dance 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.290
 there may be also those of pesticides 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 which are carried by the saddle and which will enter the plant 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 and there at that time can do considerable damage in the body 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 there are some products that can be consumed 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 without breaking the budget starchy foods that are still 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.330
 not so much more expensive since we find them in honduras 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.710
 down to 82 euros the package but they are commodities 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.590
 which may be interesting to consume from time to time it's 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 always good to have a little bit hard at home too 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.540
 the budget year the mucem does not want to be so important that it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 from the moment to think about what we eat 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.450
 industrialization 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.160
 for the pageantry that this set 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.620
 other one who read products that are not necessarily also the 2 5 we want 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.490
 to say it well 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.700
 for them any opinion that was at one meter of water 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 2 that to work exactly on the nature of the soil nature 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.889
 products that we consume 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.359
 to question himself it appears very long on the fact that 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.409
 the part of the population that lives the hotel group has experienced 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.889
 agriculture by adhering by hand to a little 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.889
 the sensation k 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.479
 so to different types of products that are offered to us 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.889
 there are vegetables and dairy products and to delegates from 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.200
 fruits there are 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.779
 no 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.079
 a member of the upstream 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:42.879
 the chip 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.310
 the second group and for recovers the products led by the usa 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.519
 to make batches to distribute the product ferrand adherents and after a 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.930
 redistribution that is done is a process of trying to go 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.929
 at the supermarket 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.899

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.509
 emblematic gulf soublin 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.799
 today I am in great shape 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.379
 rape 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.099
 at the ironwork 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.039
 the others ate contracts with england or companies of 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.139
 lunch 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.429
 white oatmeal and otherwise beat for the other more difficult ships the 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.949
 risk of erosion and all that I started to do 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.249
 critics 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.249
 in contrast so as to avoid erosion 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.110
 the documentary in number 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.329
 curan degrades the fertility of men 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.249
 much better produce to military potential to meet a one 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.080
 culture 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.439
 much more reasoned 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.579
 but I think that when you make a much more flexible culture 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.479
 laurent how did the grandparents do it 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.559
 we know that the earth overnight even to answer to some 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.569
 either the production 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.599
 it will work in the separations the people who are in the hard we see 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.539
 than today to remedy his claims there 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:05.589
 daysi of the ordinary 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.430
 the low times it does not always work because 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.439
 from there the active ingredient the seedlings too low to shine on the turn 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.309
 and we end up having disasters intentions that are really 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.780
 disabled next Thursday you subscribe to comfortable but 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.840
 I'm trying to reichstett a come to trial since in ten years 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.019
 over the 12 months of activity 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.019
 and me it is what I can to transmit to its targets 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.569
 the match he was born in Cairo was to do the conventional and my son is 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.400
 born at the time I started selling the hardmaster 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.510
 but if it was the parent wife there were 120 5 acres of non-grain 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.880
 Convention to honor the filing of a complaint and therefore that it had 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.250
 forty thousand hens and then% and for the shifter the respondent and 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.999
 the cases the weather like that there 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.659
 we were four or five leblanc 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.800
 hens are playing in the same buildings except that there is a lot less 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.559
 so that animal welfare level they can go outside while it was 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.029
 not the case before we went from 40 thousand hens to 6000 to follow him 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.779
 it's a little what decided me 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.039
 it's a sanitary problem in poultry houses 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.250
 there the salmonella problem tone and forward rather than launching on 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.520
 them something that suited me not all ways I chose to go on 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.410
 the live that's the thing that gets me off that did that I want to talk 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.849
 to do your cause for a long time in failure consume a lot 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.509
 of meat that is produced a lot of grain to feed animals for 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.560
 feed the men behind 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.960
 yet fed people with too much meat in general the problems of 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 health in addition to that we know that the research that has the effect been made 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.130
 on the lake of carcans week was not worn by all 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:52.020
 so all that makes that potential evolution bernard on the duo% still 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.010
 relatively important we see what we consume years 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.879
 we are well 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.429
 hyundai consumed compared to others in fact when one is strong for 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:03.469
 his original fight mangani compromise troyen of mineral origin 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.240
 years old 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.759
 p information 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.759
 often often well 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.599
 for latecomers that 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.339
 the ouissam on that side it's still very very satisfied 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:17.759
 poutine he perseveres
