00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.980
 one of the most important applications of microcircuits 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.889
 RAM is the organization 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.259
 varied because it will 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.569
 buffer memory 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.659
 for intermediate data storage 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.989
 passing between 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.489
 and system 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.079
 The actual coupling of the coupling consists in 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.799
 next transmitting device 

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.009
 records the data being transferred 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.059
 and the receiving device to read 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.620
 minimum data 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.280
 so correspondent intermediate 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.490
 storage causes in society 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.480
 coordinate device operation 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 participating mobile phone 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.140
 increase their independence only 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.280
 only match the transmission rates and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 reception yes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.790
 the main difference bought memory 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.430
 also for temporary storage of information 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 amount to tons 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.990
 which is characteristic that 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.180
 always be 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.160
 none of course not 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 but 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.290
 information blockade was run in 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.580
 justified 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 input and output 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.440
 as noted in the management however no 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.910
 consider an example since the struggle 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.300
 first set 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.690
 this is the simplest one direction will be 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 periodically pressing mobile on the principle 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 one device records 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.590
 information 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.830
 issued information 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.600
 guys always sign up 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.520
 speak to all addresses considered 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.100
 also 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.580
 100 records arrives in recording mode purity 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 required for recording 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 they come in reading purity of days 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.640
 for save reading in the park 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.980
 in this case 1 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.800
 necessity and more 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.850
 brute pressure testing 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.189
 moreover, clicks will be taught only in the mode 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.189
 direct account having from sad 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.880
 the structure has 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.540
 was sent for two years periodically 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.669
 baget bagmetta type 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.099
 fair he allows you to sell and take 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.449
 data sets 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:14.509
 out more flexible 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.469
 they fixed as previous 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.359
 western 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.209
 so the problem arises in particular when 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.249
 design from the authors of the local 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:24.819
 network 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.499
 board scheme opens right includes 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.159
 buy up to two years 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.069
 when testing counters eat 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 their disc segment development type 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.699
 future transformation 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:39.960
 so year 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.640
 followers in transferring networks and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.649
 will follow 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.010
 from cars 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.929
 when taken by the city 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.419
 operation mode 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.269
 are set by two 3 years 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.879
 one of which then decide the transfer mode 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.480
 all but another reception mode on the network 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.919
 another Russian woman is confused with 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.079
 continuously 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:02.950
 or vice versa 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.650
 newsru.com site first is continuous 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.170
 and with the other only at the time of appeal 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 sister 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 in this case 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.129
 already need to have big chicago 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.079
 matched 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.209
 weekends which nato 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.219
 multiplexing with 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.139
 multiplexes
