00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
palette and I'm taking foxy which is the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.620 
palette and I'm taking foxy which is the
first<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:03.130> there's<00:02:03.759> just<00:02:03.820> like<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.210> yellowy

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630

skin<00:02:04.930> tone<00:02:05.140> sort<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.470> shade<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:06.039> using<00:02:06.310> that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
skin tone sort of shade I'm using that

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.320 
skin tone sort of shade I'm using that
to<00:02:07.240> help<00:02:07.360> me<00:02:07.600> blend<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:09.100> I'm<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.610> putting<00:02:10.209> it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
to help me blend so I'm just putting it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330 
to help me blend so I'm just putting it
above<00:02:10.660> where<00:02:10.989> sriracha's<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.800> you're<00:02:12.040> very

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
above where sriracha's if you're very

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
above where sriracha's if you're very
pink<00:02:12.610> toned<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.150> might<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.750> right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
pink toned this might not be the right

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.699 
pink toned this might not be the right
color<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.200> you

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
color for you

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.949 
color for you
so<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.760> might<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> go<00:02:16.270> something<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.810> bit

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so you might want to go something a bit

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.350 
so you might want to go something a bit

and this is going to be going on a Mac
two<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.590> four<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.610> blend<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.000> into<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
two to four just to blend it into the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.540 
two to four just to blend it into the
crease<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:26.019> don't<00:02:26.500> really<00:02:26.830> want<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.190> overlap

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
crease you don't really want to overlap

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
crease you don't really want to overlap
this<00:02:27.850> with<00:02:28.150> thrash<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.050> probably

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
this with thrash because it's probably

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.250 
this with thrash because it's probably
going<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.560> go<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.739> really<00:02:29.950> disgusting<00:02:30.610> color

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260

2<00:02:39.850> palette<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.450> I'm<00:02:41.260> gonna<00:02:41.739> use<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.580> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
2 palette and I'm gonna use this to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.370 
2 palette and I'm gonna use this to
blend<00:02:43.060> away<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.480> edge<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.930> also<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
blend away the edge and also to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.840 
blend away the edge and also to
highlight<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.799> brow<00:02:44.980> bone<00:02:45.010> at<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> same<00:02:45.610> time

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
highlight the brow bone at the same time

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.550 
highlight the brow bone at the same time
sometimes<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.660> really<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:46.989> soften<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> edge

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
sometimes it really can soften the edge

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
sometimes it really can soften the edge
to<00:02:47.769> use<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.130> another<00:02:48.730> eye<00:02:48.850> shadow<00:02:49.209> rather<00:02:49.540> than

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
to use it another eye shadow rather than

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.870 
to use it another eye shadow rather than
just<00:02:49.959> using<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.440> blending<00:02:51.370> brush<00:02:51.430> with<00:02:51.850> no

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
jilted I didn't plan to originally but

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.190 
jilted I didn't plan to originally but
it's<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.670> pinky<00:03:23.670> purple<00:03:23.849> shade<00:03:24.540> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
it's just this pinky purple shade and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.800 
it's just this pinky purple shade and
then<00:03:25.650> blending<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.280> into<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> crease<00:03:27.329> as

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
then blending that into the crease as

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.990 
then blending that into the crease as
well<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.530> under<00:03:28.829> eye<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.549> original

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
well for the under eye the original

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.199 
well for the under eye the original
picture<00:03:30.390> has<00:03:30.629> green<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.280> actually<00:03:32.609> wanted

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
picture has green but I actually wanted

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.839 
picture has green but I actually wanted
to<00:03:33.359> use<00:03:33.569> urban<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.290> under<00:03:34.590> eye<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
to use urban for the under eye so I

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.110 
to use urban for the under eye so I
think<00:03:36.209> I'll<00:03:36.510> take<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.739> jumbo<00:03:38.280> pencil<00:03:38.489> again

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
think I'll take the jumbo pencil again

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.160 
think I'll take the jumbo pencil again
just<00:03:40.079> line<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.920> lower<00:03:41.069> lash<00:03:41.220> line<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.170> then

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
just line the lower lash line and then

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.080 
just line the lower lash line and then
taking<00:03:43.500> over<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.859> an<00:03:43.980> eyeshadow<00:03:44.280> brush<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.939> a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
taking over on an eyeshadow brush just a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.629 
taking over on an eyeshadow brush just a
small<00:03:45.329> one<00:03:45.450> I'm<00:03:45.930> pressing<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.159> to<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
small one I'm pressing it on to the

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.879 
small one I'm pressing it on to the
jumbo<00:03:48.359> pencil<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.379> sticks<00:03:49.650> on

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
jumbo pencil just so that it sticks on

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.520 
jumbo pencil just so that it sticks on
and<00:03:50.069> we<00:03:50.129> don't<00:03:50.219> get<00:03:50.430> too<00:03:50.609> much<00:03:50.730> fallout<00:03:51.030> I

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
and we don't get too much fallout I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.509 
and we don't get too much fallout I
think<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.739> gonna<00:03:52.859> look<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.099> bit<00:03:53.280> strange

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519

happened<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.830> always<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.310> stick

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
happened so you always have to stick

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.800 
happened so you always have to stick
around<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.760> end<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.000> video<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.630> while

around to the end of the video but while

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.070 
around to the end of the video but while
I<00:04:33.840> was<00:04:33.900> away<00:04:34.199> I<00:04:34.849> notice<00:04:35.849> that<00:04:36.030> my<00:04:36.180> liner<00:04:36.479> on<00:04:37.020> my

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.629 
I was away I notice that my liner on my
waterline<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.770> wasn't<00:04:38.190> looking<00:04:38.250> intense
