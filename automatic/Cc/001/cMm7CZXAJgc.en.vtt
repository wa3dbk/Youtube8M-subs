00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.169
 hello to all and all these fixed jay 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.549
 how are you going to end up 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.830
 today for a pretty video 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.310
 particular since in this Thursday 18 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.699
 October 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.650
 I just received a talent corner 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.239
 wendel 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.650
 so this is the figurine if we can say 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:19.849
 official assassin's creed 3 then 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.919
 I 'm getting today it's weird 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.509
 since in fact we are 18 I believe 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.300
 that she had to go out on the 31st I'm not 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.929
 not sure so in fact my fabien dupuis 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.359
 collective 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.530
 you can buy it again on their 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.170
 site it's perfect freedom etc to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.610
 raise brest so I got it to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.899
 know that there is a second figure there 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.809
 do not confuse this figurine 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.699
 with the figurine in the edition 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.239
 freedom since it is different 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.190
 so I have not opened the box yet 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.809
 I just removed the little scott here 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.449
 to make it easier to open the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.219
 louvre game with live we will discover 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.929
 we think those who hesitated to buy it 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.850
 you will see what it looks like here 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.760
 and I will go back to you 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.730
 entire collection so we will open his 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.100
 immediately friends no it's true that it 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.590
 I was a little surprised to see her see her 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.320
 today 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:18.729
 so glued 18 years old then we come out to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.189
 the old linen ear slow at home 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:26.110
 huawei and by the way the name you saw 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.880
 from the comoros they have a little plagiarized on the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.719
 assembly of the thousand subscribers what since 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.179
 mounting 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.759
 it is also called very wrong except cg 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.679
 fixed before I say something in June are 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.100
 something is happening 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.939
 an international plot ok you 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.720
 wait i'll take it off 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.310
 tomorrow there is the Wii so it is that we 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.640
 in fact you are on a tree I put it 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 that a cocktail and the open one was not going 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.979
 not slightly more so that's what it is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 looks like it's north that connects 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.119
 beautiful we can say the arc of connor so 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.170
 she is nice his hood which by a little 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.030
 at the one again 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.549
 so in fact there the thing is that she 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.629
 is tied with with sons I 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.160
 do not know if you see here 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:10.420
 so what I'm going to do is we're going 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.260
 get together right after the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.299
 time that I remove them 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.690
 like that it'll be easier and we 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.100
 So here's here's action figure 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.720
 connor one knows a little lewd to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.250
 remove it there is a nothing if there are any 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.139
 scriptures below assassin's creed 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.989
 iii collective life we do not care 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:30.310
 so here's to know 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.079
 known which on a representative tree of the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.470
 style of play that we will obviously 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.640
 in the gameplay 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.980
 the murder that rhythm so what is 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 funny if I'm not mistaken it's 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.710
 that in fact the bow string is a 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.040
 real rope 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.490
 you see it's not something 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.710
 fixed 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.140
 it's really the real strings and that 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.600
 it's really nice it's not bad 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.520
 all 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.860
 realistic in any case so what I'm going 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.930
 to do is I'm going to add it to my 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.650
 collection right away that I'm going 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.240

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.320
 see it here we have the co2 city awesome 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.760
 so that's my collection 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.120
 so I'm just going to move the light 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 stories you see a little better 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.140
 the figurines in question here are then 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.030
 I obviously have the figurine of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.190

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.780
 always available for a price of 200 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.700
 euros i believe on the ubisoft website 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.060
 you will look in the eight 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.490
 collective ' here we have the tactics 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.780
 of assassin's creed 2 he ensures the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.730
 assassin's figurine creed brotherhood 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.070
 is that of assassin's creed 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.360
 revelations 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.360
 Well, I'll just add it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.670
 between 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.430
 here 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.580
 does that do it 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.410
 wow that's pretty good 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.540
 so that's my collection and then 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 behind it is actually a bit of urine 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.630
 secondary a little smaller 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.490
 that's where a broken leg is needed 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.730
 that I take the road pass I do something 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.220
 thing 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.870
 so I'm looking forward to anyway 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.480
 the freedom edition I do not really know 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.940

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.850
 can fit the edition figurine 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.130
 freedom in any case I invite you to 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.530
 share the video and I hope that 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.780
 will have given you a good 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.190
 security mrs rey just not if you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.720
 go through a little message a month 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.520
 about the paris games week 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.070
 so there will be during the holiday 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.620
 All Saints will be there with a part 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.630
 of maxim that I think we will turn 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.480
 then we'll be here on October 31st 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.140
 on wednesday the first days actually 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.030
 we will turn around the stand ubisoft I 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.700
 so think of if you do not recognize 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.440
 do not hesitate to mail us and we 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.450
 why not talk to you 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.810
 it's even safe if you want to change 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.240
 three words 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.770
 and something else anyway here we have 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.990
 soon to exceed the thousand 300 subscribers 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.480
 it's pretty huge 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.850
 since at times must 1300 subscribers 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.930
 so it's really not bad anyway 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.700
 thank you very much I wanted 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.780
 also show you I got myself 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:10.250
 very recently the volumes the vise of the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.770
 letter of the story anyway in 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.020
 assassin's book creed 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.340
 so there are four volumes for those who 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.510
 like reading so it's still 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.169
 something something big and 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.240
 of enough ep 1 as you can see in 4 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.190
 tome you have the first one it's called 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.540
 rebirth the second it's 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.889
 brotherhood the third is the 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.510
 secret crusade it's not the first 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.340
 since in fact there is backtracking 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.970
 and the last one these revelations does that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.070
 complete 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.780
 you have more details on 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.370
 the story of the game and it's things 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.310
 that you do not necessarily know and that's 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.820
 rather nice to read it's not a 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.919
 reading more bitchy ccyn fric what so 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.139
 it's really nice I invite you to 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.700
 take a look at it that's it 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.620
 my audition my animus edition is blowing 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.419
 or below on the connection I will do 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.930
 maybe a video presentation of 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.490
 collection 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.220
 we asked but hey I do not see 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:02.390
 too much plastic utility here you in 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.140
 so here is in any case do not hesitate to 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.030
 share the video on facebook story 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.760
 km of world can see it 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.010
 so it was the panther palardy figurine 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.720
 game but very surely the link if you 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.979
 want to buy it in the description and 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.840
 then I will also put the stupid video 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.030
 which is also called 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.250
 go there feel free to like to 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.590
 to share and to comment it always does 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.730
 pleasure we will leave each other on these beautiful 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.730
 figurines hi to all
