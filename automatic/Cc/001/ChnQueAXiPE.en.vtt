00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 by the knee all that such and mayra 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.490
 montero through readings tells me of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.960
 mount and distract the 'top ten' best 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.960
 sagas that I read in 2014 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.570
 and I'm going to talk about this jordan 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.460
 on the back of yerba and hitler is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 a room that I started reading this year the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.839
 first, I liked it a lot, although not 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 he finished convincing me the second one 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.080
 I like it a lot and the third one I loved it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.670
 therefore in a saga that wanted 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.430
 recommend because it's a saga that go 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.019
 the books to better something that I value 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.339
 very positively because in general the 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.869
 sagas the first book is very good the 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.460
 second very loose and the third regulin 

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.610
 in this case in the anzhi in this case 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.659
 they're going better in a saga about dragons to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.070
 everyone who likes the subject not 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.799
 I have not even the fantasy should read it 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.939
 because pausing the next one is trilogy 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.670
 of which I want to speak to you both 

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.710
 cruisers misunderstood blue jeans or 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 from now cut through here that consists of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 a princess you do not smile that I fall in love and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 I can dream about you is a trilogy that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 I also think that I started reading this year 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.439
 I think so, and in fact I loved it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think this summer's law is a 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.040
 very good surgery that I had already read of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.150
 plugins songs for paula and I liked it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.830
 very much 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.510
 and the truth is that they are understood not 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 the typical of jeans is left behind 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.950
 many personal love story 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.420
 parallel and this we see value of the one that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.770
 he has a lot of people and he knows 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.210
 control them all to me it seems to me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.010
 How flippant are you able to control 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.330
 So much is one of the best sagas that 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.700
 I read this year and I also recommend them 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.580
 much later we have the obsidian saga 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 what is obsidian onix opal and origin this 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.350
 year the origin and for that reason creator of this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 saga I do not talk much about her because she 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 publishes a book every year then we 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
 It coincidentally coincides with nothing 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 social but one of the sagas that most 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 he liked that he gives me in all my life 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.210
 deal with aliens but 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 original the characters are very good 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.780
 the plot hooked a lot if not what 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.400
 you have read slow because it hooks a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.500
 bunch especially people 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.970
 adult youth literature production 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 lyon adult will love you and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.820
 I hope the teacher is wonderful 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.619
 immense and also wanted to talk about the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.560
 trilogy of the selection this year I gave him 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.479
 the chosen left is one of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.950
 my favorite theologies also in fact 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.290
 it seems that next year is going to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.910
 publish another book are five at the end and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.040
 is one of the best sagas that has 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.200
 continued this year is a saga that 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.269
 is about the dystopian world where the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.350
 mind is divided into castes and the 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.020
 last house 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.190
 poor and the first the richest and our 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.080
 america protagonist than 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.820
 belongs to the caste five or six or 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 seven which is that of the musicians of the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.460
 artists and it's pretty poor and one day it's 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 a kingdom the gathering of 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.080
 people women because they are going to give 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.330
 selection where the prince chooses wife 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.890
 to be his queen and I thought he was going to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.390
 be the typical princess book and for 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.280
 nothing because the super protagonist 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.750
 revolutionary does not like anything the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 situation that lives wants to change the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.300
 society that lives and is very good said 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.460
 I wanted to tell you about the 90-day saga that 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.720
 consists of 90 days every day and a 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.400
 more day and now it seems that they are going to 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 publish a how many book in January that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640
 I'm looking forward to reading erotic saga work 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.530
 for people who like them 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.600
 erotic I recommend a point has 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.450
 a very good plot are super short 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.610
 in the super fast the author or author who 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.320
 I do not know what it is that the author writes very 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.160
 well the descriptive are very good and it is 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.420
 very original 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.400
 I have wanted to talk about the trilogy of 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260
 this perkins film began with a kiss 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.520
 in Paris the boy next color continues 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.650
 and ended happily ever after 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.760
 makes them little and happy forever 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.560
 more so I've already finished the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.239
 trilogy and she could not leave her out d 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.220
 of 'top ten' best sagas this year 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.310
 without a doubt it is one of the best sagas 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.810
 read in my life and this year also this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.610
 fricciones perkins is a very author 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.680
 very own staff I can not compare them 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.390
 with nothing because it does not look like anything 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.220
 what is written deals with stories 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.900
 romantic youth with a very touch 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.040
 special has nothing to do with it 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.080
 that is written so if you have not 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.700
 I have read it because I will like it later 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.230
 I want to talk about theology and that the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.209
 listener this year good in December 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.890
 read a book and in January-February finish 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.800
 third parties and that more or less consists of 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.060
 guanxi rice in a trilogy that I read in 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.080
 English in Spanish are also 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.900
 published as 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.880
 once and a new world in a trilogy 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 I like a lot dystopian but 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.930
 very different and very original I like it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.220
 the dystopia now I recommend a lot 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 that what you're going to like a lot 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.000
 characters are super special is a 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.680
 novel is that it is very different is very 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 rare and now I enjoyed a lot in 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.389
 English makes it easy to read so read it 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.190
 then the trilogy a place de javier 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.440
 notches has also ended this year is 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.150
 play show live book with an author 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.280
 Spanish that I quite like that also 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.220
 of youtube left his position here and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.390
 bloggers and others and the truth is that they are 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.569
 books I like a lot because I 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.369
 he liked it a lot as he writes 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.800
 this trilogy especially I like a 

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:38.080
 I have liked all the books 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.460
 it seems super original is the third 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.659
 it was a little bit the one that gives me because it was already 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.059
 the one that closed the second second 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.229
 loved I love how screen javi ruiz 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.089
 I love his characters here 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.059
 they love your story and you have to read something 

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.979
 of pedrueca the trilogy first the 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.050
 ninth book that I come to see you here 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.789
 it's an order it's just the ten 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.249
 books that I'm going to talk about this year that is 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.899
 ephemeral fever and severe I do not know how it 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.969
 called the third in Spanish because what 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:03.789
 I have in English and I read this year the 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:07.629
 third I liked a lot is a trilogy 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:10.270
 type i ones and rise quite special a 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.649
 very special story not anything typical in 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.300
 reality has many things in common 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:15.430
 but they do not look alike but I related them 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.289
 a lot and confuses them sometimes I love 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.729
 I just love it, I like the 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.469
 dystopia to like if you do not like the 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.659
 dystopia you will not like it too 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.119
 I say but a very special novel and 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.800
 then finally the trilogy of gabriel 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.659
 which consists of gabriel hell the 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.029
 ecstasy of gabriel and the redemption of 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.429
 gabriel is another trilogy that the whole law 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.709
 this year erotic trilogy toschack os 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:37.120
 So fat but you like the 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:39.010
 erotic you will like 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.840
 is one of the best sagas I read 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.370
 this year because it is an erotic novel 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.440
 very different from what is written 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.880
 it also tells no story 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.889
 romantic there are not so many scenes 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.110
 explicit but it's a story of 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.630
 love between a student and her teacher 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.850
 The elegant theme is very much the truth 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.410
 it's something very strong in this novel to me 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.120
 I like our surgery, it has 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.919
 liked a lot and they like erotic les 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.960
 I recommend a lot and nothing until here 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.610
 10 best sagas between the days I've 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.710
 read this year that I have continued reading 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.090
