00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.210 
theme I guess you guys were you know
maybe<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.990> might<00:02:24.320> be<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> been<00:02:24.770> but<00:02:24.920> not<00:02:25.040> break

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
maybe you might be a been but not break

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.320 
maybe you might be a been but not break
but<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.550> guys<00:02:25.670> gonna<00:02:25.820> make<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.000> lot<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.150> players

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
but you guys gonna make a lot of players

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.460 
but you guys gonna make a lot of players
on<00:02:26.480> both<00:02:26.570> sides<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> balls<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.350> they

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
on both sides of the balls and they

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.200 
on both sides of the balls and they
definitely<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.950> think<00:02:28.040> that's<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.790> don't<00:02:29.090> want

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
definitely I think that's a I don't want

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.190 
definitely I think that's a I don't want
to<00:02:29.270> say<00:02:29.330> we're<00:02:29.480> lacking<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.080> past

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
to say we're lacking that in the past

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.300 
to say we're lacking that in the past
couple<00:02:30.410> years<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.890> think<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.190> know<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
couple years but I think you know that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.460 
couple years but I think you know that
swagger<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.180> know<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:33.200> really

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
swagger that you know that we really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.630 
swagger that you know that we really
were<00:02:33.680> kind<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.920> missing<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.340> think<00:02:34.520> that's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
were kind of missing I think that's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.680
