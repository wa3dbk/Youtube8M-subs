 of the year the dec necrosis maca type necrosis 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 has the distinction of being composite index 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.010
 from cards to ritual in these monsters 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.560

 brio nac the necros can not be 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.130
 invoked only by current to 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.470
 using major cards ritual necrosis 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 such as no columnist party in the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.860
 secrets of eternity kaledo necrosis 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.660
 mirror and necrosis exam believe the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.090
 main cards that should be played 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.360
 in the dec will be caster of the shirt 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.440
 very schulhoff heroes of necrosis necrosis 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.760
 of clause aulas brio nac of the necrosis 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.260
 as well as the preparations of wrinkles that 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.740
 will also be reissued in this 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.410
 extension 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.479
 it's really a highly anticipated archetype 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.280
 by the players and that we risk very 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.040
 probably to find the next 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 big tournament tell me what are you 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.250
 in thoughts of this new archetype of the lily 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.320
 genesis so regarding the archetype 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.020
 necrosis I think it's a very good 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.660
 archetypes because there is an option really 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.550
 very strong modulation of the hand 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.730
 since many cards you 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.380
 allow to be ditches to go 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.019
 authorized daaka the hand the 4th you 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 do I want to think for example of monsters 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.790
 necrosis clause naze as you have 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.459
 to add a hand ritual magic 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.590
 for the brio nike at the end of the moat for 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.600
 go get a good this ritual so 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.370
 all its effects make that finally with 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
 your starting base you can have 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.310
 input a little everything you want 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.310
 to play well 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.950
 thank you for a genesis list here I am 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.960
 pretty much agree with you as I wanted 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.100
 said before but cros is really 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.750
 the archetype that will make a lot of talk 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.330
 it is in this that I recommend 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 to buy at least 10 p forces 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.550
 secret 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.330
 besides you can find them at 60 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.040
 euros units in us jap arcade so by 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.760
 relation to a tragedy it's really 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 cheap and then a competitive dea to 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.510
 less than 150 euros 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250
 it's more than reasonable so here it is 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.570
 you hate it now a genesis 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.590
 tell us about the archetype spirit list 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.290
 so I'm going to introduce you it's 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.750
 the spiritual archetype track km all 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.030
 first cut it in half since we 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.160
 have a spiritual part beast and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.330
 a portion of manners is that a 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.310
 only currency that will necessarily 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.710
 translated I think beard and spiritual and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.230
 amr if we had to explain live at 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.900
 doctor and each synthetic part has 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.640
 a very specific role the spiritual beast 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.460
 are simply going to have for mission 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.830
 put the cards in the cemetery or 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.930
 to remove them from the game while 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.150
 tigers will summon from the graveyard 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.040
 where since remove it from the game another 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.780
 monster all for what to do 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.510
 and well to realize the real ones 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.850
 vocations fusion contact but who 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.000
 unlike invocations contact on 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.700
 will say classic neo spatial or beautiful 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.460
 and sorting will be removed from the game 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.650
 monsters material these broadcasts 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.130
 are going to really have an aspect of 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 control and gold as a rowing ability 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.330
 in own archetype of being able to be 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.640
 demoted to be able to invoke 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.980
 especially since the banished one 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.740
 monster beautiful girl rituals and another 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.300
 doctor but not necessarily those used 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.789
 for the occasion merger 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.039
 and we finished this analysis with 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.120
 the archetype peÃ¯o som plays mechanics 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.979
 of those from the docks to do 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.800
 many normal vocations during the 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.520
 same trick the dax base on spam and the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.319
 customization 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.180
 it contains monsters produced from 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.229
 type b to go there to make 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.659
 back in hand cards 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.710
 the opponent the main cards that 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.569
 should be played in several 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.250
 copies in the dec are the two 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.310
 weasel lighthouses and place five days calm 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.409
 Thai friends and kaman hitachi the map

 day and the magic map of kayes stein of 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.500
 trial is also alain because point of

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.580
 the habit should pass 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.469
