00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.350

 In fact, having to say all in all, no July is about to begin to say so 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.980
 nobody knows 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.820

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 Career started

 yes she reports of strong opponents 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.520
 What do I believe now here in Munich 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 not stopping or coming to Manhattan but to land 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.460
 I look at her all the way forward as the stage in my life lengthens 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190
 I am very happy to be here 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.840
 a family is also in the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 eleven from Internet addiction WestLB has Sixt wonderment 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.080
 Reinhard Rauball said I could first take it as the best 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.720
 Froyo of the Sheraton Munich Arabellapark 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.180
 not yet completely 1 1 percent 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390
 "It's tight 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 and in terms of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 and on a brand 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.690
 a fantastic challenge so far 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.020
 where is the situation still there is no two years 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 They write that people also in old age 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.780
 that the corporation is naturally fantastic with it 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.850
 Year 2010 to begin 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.350
 with Martin 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.199
 future-oriented and unparalleled 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.999
 only very briefly what does it mean because so far are best insight to 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.319
 Ended World Cup in mid-2009 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.229
 so far stands for the loans reduce 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.149
 and associations also forward-looking 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.469
 foresighted one sees quite strongly 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.019
 he knew in return to personally comfortable 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.640
 I think that you can really use this as a strategic decision of two 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.479
 partner 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.729

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.139
 Teams that certainly help a lot and connect with each other 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.680
 but that too no noteworthy it must be the 1 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.279
 of course also in connection with the own brands 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.989
 exciting is certainly this year 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.469
