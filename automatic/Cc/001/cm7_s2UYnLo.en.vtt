 coating 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
 minus what 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.629
 brand name visible fingerprints not 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.669
 I know how you 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.229
 on the very push 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.439
 Moroccan 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.439

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.999
 Moroccan 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.379
 didn't like 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.679
 what he has 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.069
 bright enough color 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.379
 since i took this knife for from 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.099
 dollar 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.269
 on the beam 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.059
 the hunt 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.399
 the knife will fall 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.799
 let's say green trees are enough 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.089
 long bush 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.679
 but the data 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.679
 m immediately catches the eye microns 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.959
 he said now 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.180
 plastic 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.079
 there is enough 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.719
 baku good plastic 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.710
 of this nature 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.610
 mounting method 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.680
 clip 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.879
 that simultaneously eesu 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.229
 since still given knives 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.889
 can be used as a kitchen 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.300
 made such 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.770
 as fortification on the wall 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.120

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.909
