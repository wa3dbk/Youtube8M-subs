later
so<00:00:27.000> point<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.480> start<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.019> service<00:00:28.699> for<00:00:29.699> each

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so point is start with service for each

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.020 
so point is start with service for each
point<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.570> player<00:00:30.810> has<00:00:31.080> two<00:00:31.320> services<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.160> one

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
point of player has two services a one

has to serve from the red area and if it
falls<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> black<00:00:36.690> area<00:00:37.079> known<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.620> service

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
falls on black area known as service

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.910 
falls on black area known as service
block<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.850> serve<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.600> else<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
block then serve is right else it is for

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
block then serve is right else it is for
the<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:42.030> service<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.170> he<00:00:43.350> tried

second time called a second so the
second<00:00:47.219> service<00:00:47.520> fourth<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.360> point<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
second service fourth then point is

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.400 
difference of 2 if you win this then the
set<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.310> yours<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.420> you've<00:04:17.630> been<00:04:17.810> upset<00:04:17.989> and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
set is yours and you've been upset and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.870 
set is yours and you've been upset and
math<00:04:19.160> score<00:04:19.580> becomes<00:04:19.970> 1<00:04:20.330> 0<00:04:21.370> next<00:04:22.370> code<00:04:22.550> becomes

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
math score becomes 1 0 next code becomes

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.460 
math score becomes 1 0 next code becomes
1<00:04:23.210> 0<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:24.110> basically<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.810> win<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.050> set

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
1 0 so basically you have to win a set

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.640 
1 0 so basically you have to win a set
and<00:04:27.710> enough<00:04:28.580> said<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.570> have<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.110> win<00:04:30.290> six

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and enough said you have to win six

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.400 
and enough said you have to win six
games<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.730> in<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> game<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.290> win

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
games and in the game you have to win

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.380 
games and in the game you have to win
four<00:04:33.980> points<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.810> 1534<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.960> end<00:04:36.200> game

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
four points that is 1534 the end game

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.750 
four points that is 1534 the end game
the<00:04:38.390> cipher<00:04:38.900> code<00:04:39.170> our<00:04:39.530> change<00:04:40.040> when<00:04:40.280> someone

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
the cipher code our change when someone

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.320 
the cipher code our change when someone
gained<00:04:41.090> some<00:04:41.930> up<00:04:42.200> game<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.860> every<00:04:43.430> set<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:43.910> odd

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
gained some up game of every set is odd

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.110 
gained some up game of every set is odd
that<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.650> one<00:04:45.890> zero<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:46.370> sum<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.700> 1<00:04:46.880> then

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
that is that one zero then sum is 1 then

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.770 
that is that one zero then sum is 1 then
I<00:04:47.240> will<00:04:47.360> change<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.260> set<00:04:48.590> score<00:04:48.950> is<00:04:49.270> 2:1<00:04:50.270> then

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
I will change the set score is 2:1 then

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.610 
I will change the set score is 2:1 then
sum<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.200> 3<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.920> is<00:04:52.100> odd<00:04:52.280> side<00:04:52.610> will<00:04:52.820> change<00:04:52.850> at

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
sum is 3 that is odd side will change at

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.370 
sum is 3 that is odd side will change at
3:05<00:04:54.620> 4<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:57.230> all<00:04:57.350> about

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
3:05 4 and so on so that is all about

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.550 
3:05 4 and so on so that is all about
tennis<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:59.510> will<00:05:00.140> tell<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.530> that

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560

and once again I would like to clear if
you<00:05:41.780> have<00:05:42.140> any<00:05:42.410> doubt<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.610> point<00:05:44.030> showing<00:05:44.930> in

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
you have any doubt the point showing in

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.360 
you have any doubt the point showing in
the<00:05:45.440> table<00:05:45.950> are<00:05:46.400> like<00:05:47.000> 15<00:05:47.510> 30<00:05:47.780> 40<00:05:48.350> that<00:05:49.040> are<00:05:49.250> the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
the table are like 15 30 40 that are the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.060 
the table are like 15 30 40 that are the
point<00:05:49.700> of<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:50.090> game<00:05:50.360> if<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:51.080> are<00:05:51.230> born<00:05:51.650> when<00:05:52.040> a

point of a game if you are born when a
game<00:05:52.640> you<00:05:53.000> have<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.180> win<00:05:53.419> 4<00:05:53.990> point<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:55.010> that<00:05:55.700> is

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
game you have to win 4 point so that is

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.930 
game you have to win 4 point so that is
a<00:05:55.880> game<00:05:56.270> score<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:56.930> if<00:05:57.260> you<00:05:57.410> win<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.710> game<00:05:57.830> so<00:05:58.669> 2

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
a game score and if you win a game so 2

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.620 
a game score and if you win a game so 2
1<00:05:59.210> 3<00:05:59.570> 1<00:05:59.840> these<00:06:00.140> are<00:06:00.410> game<00:06:00.710> score<00:06:01.460> but<00:06:02.180> actually

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
1 3 1 these are game score but actually

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.050 
1 3 1 these are game score but actually
it's<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.900> set<00:06:03.200> score<00:06:03.560> because<00:06:04.310> you<00:06:04.490> want<00:06:04.760> to<00:06:04.880> win

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
it's a set score because you want to win

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.630 
it's a set score because you want to win
a<00:06:05.090> set<00:06:05.419> then<00:06:05.690> you<00:06:05.750> have<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.169> win<00:06:06.350> six<00:06:06.590> games<00:06:06.980> so

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
a set then you have to win six games so

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.930 
a set then you have to win six games so
the<00:06:07.880> middle<00:06:08.540> one<00:06:08.630> is<00:06:08.900> said<00:06:09.830> score<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.400> match
