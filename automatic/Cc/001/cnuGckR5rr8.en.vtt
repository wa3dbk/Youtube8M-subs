or a foot shop type of light here and
then<00:02:34.220> when<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.400> comes<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.700> bulbs<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.480> need<00:02:35.630> to

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
then when it comes to bulbs you need to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.540 
then when it comes to bulbs you need to
it<00:02:35.990> kind<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.320> mix<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.740> match<00:02:36.830> two<00:02:37.220> different

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
it kind of mix and match two different

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.960 
it kind of mix and match two different
bulbs

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
bulbs

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.440 
bulbs
there<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:39.340> basically<00:02:40.340> three<00:02:40.460> bulbs<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.240> you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
there are basically three bulbs that you

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.810 
there are basically three bulbs that you
commonly<00:02:41.960> found<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:43.490> are<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
commonly found on that that are on the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.580 
commonly found on that that are on the
light<00:02:43.970> spectrum<00:02:44.300> here<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.410> that

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
light spectrum here you can see that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.340 
light spectrum here you can see that
this<00:02:45.740> one<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.100> here<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.390> cool<00:02:47.660> cool

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
this one right here is the cool cool

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.050 
this one right here is the cool cool
tone<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.830> goes<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> lighter<00:02:49.430> side<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
tone it goes to the lighter side and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.850 
tone it goes to the lighter side and
then<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.690> one<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.290> warmer<00:02:51.710> light

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
then this one here is a warmer light

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.800 
then this one here is a warmer light
which<00:02:52.010> goes<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.490> extreme<00:02:52.880> red<00:02:53.090> side<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.660> we

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
which goes to the extreme red side so we

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.630 
which goes to the extreme red side so we
would<00:02:53.990> call<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.530> blue<00:02:54.830> light<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.340> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
would call this one a blue light and a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.640 
would call this one a blue light and a
red<00:02:55.670> light<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.540> want<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.780> mix<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.140> mix<00:02:57.410> these

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
red light you want to mix and mix these

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.820 
red light you want to mix and mix these
up<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.640> t8<00:02:59.390> fixture<00:03:00.140> down<00:03:00.290> there<00:03:00.530> takes

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
up so that t8 fixture down there takes

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.220 
up so that t8 fixture down there takes
two<00:03:01.370> bolts<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:01.880> I'll<00:03:01.940> take<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.360> blue<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.840> one

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
two bolts so I'll take one blue and one

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.320 
two bolts so I'll take one blue and one
red<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.160> will<00:03:04.280> give<00:03:04.400> us<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.730> well-rounded

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
red and that will give us a well-rounded

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:52.110 
red and that will give us a well-rounded
spectrum

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.119
