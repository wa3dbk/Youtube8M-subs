00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.450 

as<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.990> can<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.290> there<00:02:52.470> are<00:02:52.560> 18<00:02:52.920> individual

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
as you can see there are 18 individual

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:01.640 
as you can see there are 18 individual
LEDs<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.450> panel<00:02:54.810> right<00:02:54.930> here<00:03:00.320> other<00:03:01.320> net

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
LEDs on this panel right here other net

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.380 
LEDs on this panel right here other net
is<00:03:01.830> pretty<00:03:02.100> straightforward<00:03:02.700> pretty<00:03:02.880> simple

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
is pretty straightforward pretty simple

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.140 
is pretty straightforward pretty simple
it's<00:03:03.990> designed<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.830> identical<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it's designed to be identical to the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.450 
it's designed to be identical to the
stock<00:03:06.510> housing<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.230> way<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:08.070> just<00:03:08.100> pop
