00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 thermaltake play even easier and so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
 thanks to the efforts of the thermal they can am 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.910
 perhaps the first in Russia to be less than new tx 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 body from thermaltake model of this summer 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.410
 seemingly ordinary cube but fortunately not all 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.449
 so boring in many ways the concept is refreshing 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 transparent window this design element 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 really refreshing body and for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.519
 such a baby you will become carefully and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.470
 pick up components 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 choose mother cooler and video card memory 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is more successful the second chip from the manufacturer 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.520
 20 centimeter front fan 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 giving excellent cooling to everyone 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 component as an option 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 use fan and other 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.860
 sizes or more interesting 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 radiator liquid cooling system 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 height for the cooler is limited to 14 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.770
 centimeters it is understandable too 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.050
 high color and then the body is not needed 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.850
 would be very big and if 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 going dropsy i have extra height 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 even a burden well, that's what she told me 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 like only twenty five and a half 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 centimeters for a video card that is a card 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 780 and 290 so popular now in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 span power supply can be left 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.670
 almost any length 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 but who is already interested in your place under the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 winchester which are located next to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 side perforated cover landing 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.700
 without anti-vibration means external 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.920
 interface and displayed on the side that is not quite 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.619
 comfortable but in front of a large fan 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 there's nothing you can do about 3 and 5 inch 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.280
 no external compartments provided 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.180
 lovers of optical drives model 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.650
 contraindicated 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.270
 again all because of the big 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 the fan who took all 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 space on the other hand drive 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.329
 could be put on the side but again 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.470
 would it be a different concept 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.470
 Kasimova view from above 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.600
 with regard to filter against according to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.920
 then not provided for the fan 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.979
 power supply and for front 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.979
 fan 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.220
 selling can be strengthened by setting 2 intel 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.049
 tarot with a diameter of 80 millimeters each what 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 touches the front fan then he 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.670
 rotates at 800 revolutions per 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.319
 a minute that's pretty quiet food through 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.950
 trippin which facilitates speed 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.670
 adjusting legs ordinary plastic well 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.709
 what is the result 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.200
 interesting concept that spoils one 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.010
 Detail 25 half centimeters maximum 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.990
 for video card 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.840
 someone is fine and someone is not 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 terrible body from thermaltake from you 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.160
 was arina to new meetings
