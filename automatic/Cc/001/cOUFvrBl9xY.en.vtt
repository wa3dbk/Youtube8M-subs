00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.120 

variable<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:41.030> choose<00:02:41.390> any<00:02:41.570> number

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
variable and you can choose any number

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.530 
variable and you can choose any number
but<00:02:43.130> make<00:02:43.340> sure<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.730> remember<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:44.240> number

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
but make sure you remember what number

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.800 
but make sure you remember what number
that<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:45.460> now<00:02:46.460> next<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:50.120> don't<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.690> do

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that is now next you don't have to do

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.930 
that is now next you don't have to do
this<00:02:50.990> but<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.130> drawbridge<00:02:52.640> is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
this but it's but the drawbridge is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.190 
this but it's but the drawbridge is
going<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.540> very<00:02:53.920> quick<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.550> i<00:02:56.200> recommend

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
going to be very quick so i recommend

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.589 
going to be very quick so i recommend
you<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.709> step<00:02:58.209> post<00:02:59.209> length<00:02:59.420> enough

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
you do this step post length enough

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.449 
you do this step post length enough
variable<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:05.629> whichever<00:03:06.019> number<00:03:06.290> ages<00:03:06.739> so

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
variable in whichever number ages so

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.039 
variable in whichever number ages so
there<00:03:07.939> for<00:03:07.969> me<00:03:09.790> constant<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:10.969> how<00:03:11.329> however

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
there for me constant it's how however

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.539 
there for me constant it's how however
long<00:03:12.409> you<00:03:12.709> want<00:03:14.439> in<00:03:15.439> takes<00:03:17.680> more<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:18.709> the

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
long you want in takes more than the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.660 
long you want in takes more than the
button<00:03:19.879> and<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.799> if<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.099> button<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:23.709> say<00:03:24.709> 10

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
button and so if the button is say 10

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.599 
button and so if the button is say 10
ticks<00:03:25.969> and<00:03:26.329> you're<00:03:26.629> adding<00:03:26.900> 30<00:03:27.109> takes<00:03:27.439> if<00:03:28.400> you
