00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
plastic and the metal in the center so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
plastic and the metal in the center so
this<00:01:23.850> only<00:01:24.030> goes<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.229> fit

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
put bolt in so the two head bolts the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.920 
put bolt in so the two head bolts the
larger<00:02:54.989> ones<00:02:55.170> get<00:02:55.440> 27<00:02:56.340> foot-pounds<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.780> one

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
larger ones get 27 foot-pounds this one

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.990 
larger ones get 27 foot-pounds this one
here<00:02:58.139> gets<00:02:58.350> 18<00:02:58.620> inch<00:02:58.859> pounds<00:02:59.220> or<00:02:59.310> 7.2

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
here gets 18 inch pounds or 7.2

here gets 18 inch pounds or 7.2
foot-pounds<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.959> let<00:03:01.470> me<00:03:01.530> go<00:03:01.650> ahead<00:03:01.799> and

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
foot-pounds so let me go ahead and

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.440 
foot-pounds so let me go ahead and
tighten<00:03:02.010> those<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.609> then<00:03:02.700> we'll<00:03:03.209> resume

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450

from there okay now we're working on the
timing<00:03:06.750> chain<00:03:06.870> itself<00:03:07.639> camshaft<00:03:08.639> chain

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
timing chain itself camshaft chain

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.670 
timing chain itself camshaft chain
whatever<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.239> call<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.420> remember<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.410> told<00:03:10.470> you

whatever you call it remember I told you
not<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.859> tighten<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:11.940> to

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
not to tighten this down you have to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.000 
not to tighten this down you have to
move<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.510> install<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> chain<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.950> you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
move it to install the chain and you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.039 
move it to install the chain and you
simply<00:03:14.310> drop<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.760> chain<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.299> top<00:03:15.510> hold<00:03:15.930> it

simply drop the chain to the top hold it

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.500 
simply drop the chain to the top hold it
with<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.260> screwdriver<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:18.180> lay<00:03:18.450> in

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
with the screwdriver just just lay in

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479 
with the screwdriver just just lay in

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
there and then you just wrap it around

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.720

the<00:03:21.530> gear<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:23.010> we'll<00:03:23.220> show<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.400> how<00:03:23.549> to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the gear here now we'll show you how to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.680 
the gear here now we'll show you how to
actually<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.510> Tec<00:03:25.319> once<00:03:26.220> we<00:03:26.540> install<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
actually get Tec once we install the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.199 
actually get Tec once we install the
actual<00:03:28.019> camshaft<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.769> stay<00:03:29.760> tuned<00:03:29.970> we'll<00:03:30.180> be

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
actual camshaft so stay tuned we'll be

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.370 
actual camshaft so stay tuned we'll be
right<00:03:30.450> back<00:03:30.660> we're<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.019> put<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
right back we're going to put the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.559 
right back we're going to put the
camshafts<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.579> then<00:03:32.730> we'll<00:03:33.389> go<00:03:33.540> from

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
camshafts in and then we'll go from

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.750 
camshafts in and then we'll go from
there
