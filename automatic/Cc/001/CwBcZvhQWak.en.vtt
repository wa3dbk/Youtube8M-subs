00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.950
 a new dessert from the grill 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.220
 It's called Congress banana chocolate 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.270

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.580
 I'll show you something for that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.750
 I need the recipe for four 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.790
 people written 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 we have four more teams two 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.970
 banana peanut butter proper butter 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.670

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.330
 chocolate chips and mini marshmallows 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.800
 or 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.780
 normal marshmallows that I hold small 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.620
 We've started cutting it 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.750
 that we peel the bananas and in 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.050
 both sides on the device neat 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 fry with heat and there we go 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.130
 so now that the bananas are on the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 grill are ready I ever get the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.470
 tortillas before you take the animal and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.720
 paint with a knife or with 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.409
 his angle range peanut butter on 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.409
 deported 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:59.050
 in the meantime, ours should be 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:01.410
 bananas also be so far I look like 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.410
 you can see 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:33.780
 then proportionally just a half 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:36.739
 one half each in quito to come 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.739
 now the minimal faster 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.210
 and thirdly, I have got so far 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.010
 prepared now it's about folding 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.160
 Although you hit each such a corner 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.160
 on 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:34.860
 and then so follows me they the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.550
 So is possibility from all sides too 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:45.380
 is the most expensive one has cleaned up 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.380
 we'll brush them up well now 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.420
 So we leave the word here then is from 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.239
 on all sides the butter actually 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.120
 she has painted on the grill 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.820
 he should have around 170 to 200 degrees 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350
 and then so two or three minutes until they 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.930
 are nice brown and then the end 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
 too hot and melted so after 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.240
 four minutes from each side of that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.530
 All this way and now we'll take it 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.290
