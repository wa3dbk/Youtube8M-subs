stationery<00:00:42.899> s<00:00:43.110> box<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.129> haven't<00:00:44.370> finish<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
stationery s box so I haven't finish the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
stationery s box so I haven't finish the
packaging<00:00:45.239> yet<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> idea<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
packaging yet but this is the idea so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
packaging yet but this is the idea so
you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.370> they're<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.960> what

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you can see they're all in there what

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.500 
you can see they're all in there what
these<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.610> 15<00:00:51.090> milliliter

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
these are is these are 15 milliliter

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.350 
these are is these are 15 milliliter
using<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> lab<00:00:54.780> they're<00:00:55.050> centrifuge<00:00:55.980> tubes

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
using the lab they're centrifuge tubes

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
using the lab they're centrifuge tubes
so<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.629> fit<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.739> ink

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so they fit in so if you have ink

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
so they fit in so if you have ink
samples<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> boule<00:00:59.940> empty<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.260> they

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
samples this is a boule empty one they

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.740 
samples this is a boule empty one they
use<00:01:01.879> its<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> when

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
use its you see if you have it when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.320 
use its you see if you have it when
these<00:01:03.870> test<00:01:04.110> tube<00:01:04.260> racks<00:01:04.500> sitting<00:01:04.830> around

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
these test tube racks sitting around

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.149 
these test tube racks sitting around
these<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.840> fit<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.950> same

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
these are actually gonna fit in the same

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
these are actually gonna fit in the same
rack<00:01:08.490> you've<00:01:08.729> already<00:01:08.880> got<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> idea<00:01:10.130> here

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
rack you've already got to the idea here

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
rack you've already got to the idea here
is<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> show<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:14.600> off<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.990> set

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is you can show off your off your set

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
is you can show off your off your set
here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.710 

and<00:01:31.560> ten<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.909> can<00:01:34.090> get<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> whole<00:01:34.450> set<00:01:34.659> of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
and ten so you can get a whole set of

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.210 
and ten so you can get a whole set of
them<00:01:34.899> there<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.380> then<00:01:35.500> your<00:01:35.619> samples<00:01:36.100> of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
them there and then your samples of

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.149 
them there and then your samples of
course<00:01:36.460> will<00:01:36.640> still<00:01:36.820> fit<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.530> back<00:01:38.770> or

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
course will still fit in the back or

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.130 
course will still fit in the back or
wherever<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.610> got<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.759> put<00:01:39.909> them<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.049> it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
wherever you got to put them in so it's

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.559 
wherever you got to put them in so it's
going<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.289> fit<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.679> same<00:01:41.890> rack<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.569> some

tubes<00:02:12.040> here<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:14.410> roughly<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.950> three

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
tubes here so it's roughly the three

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.759 
tubes here so it's roughly the three
times<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.819> size<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.599> standard<00:02:16.900> sample

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
times the size of a standard sample

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.589 
times the size of a standard sample
bottle<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.430> don't<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.880> if<00:02:18.970> they<00:02:19.060> always<00:02:19.329> fill

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
bottle I don't know if they always fill

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.930 
bottle I don't know if they always fill
these<00:02:19.750> up<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:21.250> usually<00:02:21.579> get<00:02:21.819> around

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
these up I think usually get around

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.819 
these up I think usually get around
three<00:02:22.239> mils<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> sample<00:02:23.530> bottles

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
three mils in one of the sample bottles

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.020 
three mils in one of the sample bottles
so<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:27.069> makes<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.459> three<00:02:27.670> times<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
so so this makes like three times the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.710 
so so this makes like three times the
size<00:02:28.209> that's<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:29.109> comparison<00:02:29.590> roughly<00:02:30.600> yes<00:02:31.600> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
size that's a comparison roughly yes it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.759 
size that's a comparison roughly yes it
should<00:02:31.870> be<00:02:31.959> available<00:02:32.200> next<00:02:32.290> week<00:02:32.500> again

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
should be available next week again

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.729 
should be available next week again
