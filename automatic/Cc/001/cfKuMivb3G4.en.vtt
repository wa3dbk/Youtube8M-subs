better<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.309> certainly<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> moon

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
better out of it but certainly a moon

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.120 
better out of it but certainly a moon
can<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.809> keep<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.199> healing<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.740> these

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
can just keep on healing up with these

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.859 
can just keep on healing up with these
moon<00:00:17.369> walls<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.760> they'll<00:00:18.150> keep<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> Grove<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869

moon walls and they'll keep the Grove is
now<00:00:18.990> almost<00:00:19.140> back<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> altar<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.310> actually

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
now almost back the altar is actually

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
now almost back the altar is actually
very<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:21.119> low<00:00:21.270> it'd<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.900> close<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.199> swear

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
very very low it'd be so close to swear

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259 
very very low it'd be so close to swear
there<00:00:22.710> comes<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.010> no<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.430> keeping<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> real

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
there comes out no we keeping the real

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.679 
there comes out no we keeping the real
does<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.600> come<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.939> very<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:27.090> close

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
does not come out and so very very close

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
does not come out and so very very close
there<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.170> can't<00:00:28.740> believe<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:28.980> close<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.279> was

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
there I can't believe how close that was

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
there I can't believe how close that was
actually<00:00:29.640> moon<00:00:30.000> them<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:30.720> without<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> keepers

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
actually moon them now without a keepers

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.920 
actually moon them now without a keepers
ago<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.579> any<00:00:32.730> means<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.270> getting<00:00:33.719> them

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
ago not really any means of getting them

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.150 
ago not really any means of getting them
back<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.440> long<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.620> she's<00:00:35.010> gonna

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
back for a very long time she's gonna

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
back for a very long time she's gonna
have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> reroute<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.850> tree<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> life<00:00:36.270> get

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
have to reroute this tree of life get

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
have to reroute this tree of life get

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
take him a very long time actually
rebuild<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.590> moon<00:00:40.739> walls<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.040> well<00:00:41.160> cuz<00:00:41.340> stuff

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
rebuild as moon walls as well cuz stuff

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.920 
rebuild as moon walls as well cuz stuff
focus<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.059> taking<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.540> moon<00:00:42.750> walls

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
focus now is taking out these moon walls

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.100 
focus now is taking out these moon walls
so<00:00:43.469> I'm<00:00:43.710> very<00:00:44.300> very<00:00:45.300> nice<00:00:45.450> play<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.780> moon

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so I'm very very nice play there by moon

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
so I'm very very nice play there by moon
everybody<00:00:46.860> focus<00:00:47.129> re<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.430> moon<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
everybody focus re and moon now in a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
everybody focus re and moon now in a
very<00:00:48.300> sticky<00:00:48.809> situation<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.010> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
very sticky situation you just have this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
very sticky situation you just have this
tree<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.430> life<00:00:50.579> still<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.870> i'm<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.260> sure<00:00:52.320> i

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
tree of life still up but i'm not sure i

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
tree of life still up but i'm not sure i
think<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> mortars<00:00:54.390> probably<00:00:54.690> could<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.260> him

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think the mortars probably could get him

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
think the mortars probably could get him
here<00:00:55.530> somewhere<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> moon<00:00:56.520> wasn't<00:00:56.699> paying

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
here somewhere for moon wasn't paying

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.830 
here somewhere for moon wasn't paying
attention<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.859> moon<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.340> uh<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
attention and moon now actually uh I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.639 
attention and moon now actually uh I
think<00:01:00.840> he<00:01:00.899> might<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.140> been<00:01:01.289> trying<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> buy<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
think he might have been trying to buy a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.930 
think he might have been trying to buy a
Zeppelin<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> his<00:01:02.219> own<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.640> he<00:01:02.730> fell

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
Zeppelin of his own I think he fell

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539 
Zeppelin of his own I think he fell
within<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> while<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.309> perhaps<00:01:05.309> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
within on a while back but perhaps you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
within on a while back but perhaps you
didn't<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> gold<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
didn't have the gold and it's a bit of a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
didn't have the gold and it's a bit of a
shame<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.080> her

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
shame really because of this game is her

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740 
shame really because of this game is her
ending<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.619> wave<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.030> such<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.180> amazing

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
ending in this wave was such an amazing

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.980 
ending in this wave was such an amazing
play<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.140> focus<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.780> felt<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.840> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
play by focus really and I felt it is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
play by focus really and I felt it is
now<00:01:16.110> scanning<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.830> expansion<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.369> think

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
now scanning at this expansion I think

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
now scanning at this expansion I think
moons<00:01:18.200> just<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.500> fight<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.250> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
moons just to go be fight just gonna be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.740 
moons just to go be fight just gonna be
too<00:01:20.490> aware<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.970> year<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.600> he's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
too aware of this year you can see he's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.969 
too aware of this year you can see he's
just<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.049> spreading<00:01:22.380> these<00:01:22.500> units<00:01:22.799> around

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
just really spreading these units around

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.770 
just really spreading these units around
so<00:01:23.430> there's<00:01:23.610> no<00:01:23.790> way<00:01:23.909> those<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.240> modules<00:01:24.509> can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so there's no way those two modules can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.760 
so there's no way those two modules can
be<00:01:24.840> landed<00:01:25.170> where<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.380> won't<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.680> be

to run now very far away just to take

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
to run now very far away just to take
out<00:01:30.360> these<00:01:30.509> trees<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.290> only<00:01:31.770> taking

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
on one tree I don't think it's give me

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.910 
on one tree I don't think it's give me
this<00:01:33.780> yeah<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.170> only<00:01:34.259> enough<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.680> de

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
each crap that everything that serve

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010

pretty simple to creep out he could try
and<00:01:46.140> ups<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> aggressively<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and ups a bit or aggressively but I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
and ups a bit or aggressively but I

from being added but once just landed in
a<00:02:25.980> different<00:02:26.519> position<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.300> tomorrow's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
a different position here and tomorrow's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
a different position here and tomorrow's
now<00:02:28.319> taking<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.739> more<00:02:28.950> trees<00:02:29.250> very<00:02:30.239> very

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
now taking out more trees very very

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.170 
now taking out more trees very very
sneaky<00:02:30.720> play<00:02:31.110> here<00:02:31.290> by<00:02:31.319> focus<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
sneaky play here by focus and that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.250 
sneaky play here by focus and that
should<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.390> enough<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.630> land<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.019> least<00:02:34.080> one

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
should be enough to land at least one

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.620 
should be enough to land at least one
word<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.530> moisture<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.910> location<00:02:36.420> and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
word of moisture in that location and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
word of moisture in that location and
let's<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.530> yeah<00:02:37.890> he<00:02:38.099> will<00:02:38.250> either<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.640> he

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
let's see yeah he will either that he

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
let's see yeah he will either that he
will<00:02:38.880> land<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.180> couple<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.260> started

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
will land a couple there and I started

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.820 
will land a couple there and I started
to<00:02:40.590> hit<00:02:40.739> these<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.220> these<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.780> bears<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.049> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
to hit these on these I'm bears and I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.229 
to hit these on these I'm bears and I
think<00:02:44.069> probably<00:02:44.190> eventually<00:02:44.459> switch<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
think probably eventually switch to the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.509 
think probably eventually switch to the
Tree<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> Life<00:02:45.920> there<00:02:46.920> with<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.130> lot<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> lumber

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
Tree of Life there with a lot of lumber

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.100 
Tree of Life there with a lot of lumber
actually<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> guess<00:02:48.030> he's<00:02:48.209> had<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:48.840> anger

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
actually I guess he's had so much anger

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.199 
actually I guess he's had so much anger
here<00:02:49.560> he<00:02:49.860> hasn't<00:02:50.099> actually<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.370> gold<00:02:51.030> mine<00:02:51.180> for

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
here he hasn't actually a gold mine for

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
here he hasn't actually a gold mine for
his<00:02:51.420> whiskey<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.870> he<00:02:51.989> actually<00:02:52.140> has<00:02:52.349> almost<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
his whiskey and he actually has almost a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.199

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
effect now has this plane master and

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.309 
effect now has this plane master and
will<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.940> should<00:03:45.180> take<00:03:45.269> out<00:03:45.420> one<00:03:45.569> western<00:03:45.959> moon

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
will I should take out one western moon

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.050 
will I should take out one western moon
maggot<00:03:46.650> moon<00:03:47.100> doesn't<00:03:47.340> get<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.670> need<00:03:47.910> off

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
maggot moon doesn't get that need off

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.920 
maggot moon doesn't get that need off
and<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:49.579> how<00:03:50.579> would<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:51.030> play<00:03:51.299> master<00:03:51.780> will

and so how would that play master will

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.349 
and so how would that play master will
disrobe<00:03:52.260> should<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.670> able<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.910> run<00:03:54.000> away<00:03:54.180> I

disrobe should be able to run away I
think<00:03:54.750> maybe<00:03:55.200> focuses<00:03:55.680> good<00:03:55.829> move<00:03:55.980> into<00:03:56.190> a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
think maybe focuses good move into a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.210 
think maybe focuses good move into a
more<00:03:56.400> aggressive<00:03:56.639> playing<00:03:57.060> now<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.810> because

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
more aggressive playing now just because

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.319 
more aggressive playing now just because
he<00:03:59.220> knows<00:03:59.370> there's<00:03:59.609> not<00:03:59.700> really<00:03:59.819> much<00:04:00.000> we<00:04:00.150> can

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
he knows there's not really much we can

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.550 
he knows there's not really much we can
do<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.540> he<00:04:00.599> just<00:04:00.750> wants<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.019> rent<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.380> quickly

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
do it he just wants to rent it quickly

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.129 
do it he just wants to rent it quickly
and<00:04:01.829> have<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> sort<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.569> full<00:04:03.720> force<00:04:03.989> of

and have the sort of the full force of
focuses<00:04:04.799> are<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.069> coming<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.400> obviously<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
focuses are we coming in obviously a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.550 
focuses are we coming in obviously a
couple<00:04:06.239> where<00:04:06.359> is<00:04:06.450> still<00:04:06.630> pretty<00:04:06.780> strong<00:04:07.139> so

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
couple where is still pretty strong so

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.559 
couple where is still pretty strong so
force<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.069> reckoned<00:04:08.099> with<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.639> focusing

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
force to be reckoned with and focusing

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.809 
force to be reckoned with and focusing
sides<00:04:09.780> actually<00:04:10.430> well<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.549> not<00:04:11.639> worth

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
sides actually well it's not worth

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.069 
sides actually well it's not worth
taking<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.120> risk<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.750> obviously<00:04:12.870> he

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
taking the risk because obviously he

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.809 
taking the risk because obviously he
doesn't<00:04:13.319> have<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.500> resources<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:14.040> rebuild<00:04:14.489> if

doesn't have the resources to rebuild if

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.270 
actually have a greater importance
playing<00:04:21.539> master<00:04:21.780> and
