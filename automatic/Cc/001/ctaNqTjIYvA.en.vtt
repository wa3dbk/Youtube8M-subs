00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
we're going to take our battery charge

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.360 
we're going to take our battery charge
meter<00:01:11.730> and<00:01:13.200> check<00:01:14.200> for<00:01:14.230> proper<00:01:14.410> voltage<00:01:15.190> on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
meter and check for proper voltage on

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.980 
meter and check for proper voltage on
the<00:01:15.490> battery<00:01:18.030> proper<00:01:19.030> voltage<00:01:19.390> on<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.570> battery

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.950 

we're<00:01:37.400> gonna<00:01:37.490> hook<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.940> terminal<00:01:38.420> leads<00:01:38.630> back

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're gonna hook the terminal leads back

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.310 
we're gonna hook the terminal leads back
to<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.320> battery<00:01:43.510> we<00:01:44.510> want<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.840> make<00:01:44.990> sure<00:01:45.140> that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
to the battery we want to make sure that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.070 
to the battery we want to make sure that
they<00:01:45.470> fit<00:01:45.680> snug<00:01:48.640> if<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:49.850> don't<00:01:50.060> fit<00:01:50.300> snug<00:01:50.630> you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
they fit snug if they don't fit snug you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.540 
they fit snug if they don't fit snug you
can<00:01:51.230> use<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.410> pair<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.740> pliers<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.190> lightly

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550

can use a pair of pliers and lightly
crimp<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:55.250> terminal<00:01:55.280> ends<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.330> make<00:01:56.450> sure

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
crimp the terminal ends to make sure

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.070 
crimp the terminal ends to make sure
they<00:01:56.810> fit<00:01:57.050> snug<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.770> want<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.040> be<00:01:58.130> able<00:01:58.250> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
they fit snug you want to be able to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.450 
they fit snug you want to be able to
pull<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.260> them<00:02:00.410> without<00:02:00.530> pulling<00:02:01.100> them<00:02:01.370> off

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
pull on them without pulling them off

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.390 
pull on them without pulling them off
easy<00:02:02.350> we're<00:02:03.350> gonna<00:02:03.440> check<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.830> make<00:02:04.100> sure<00:02:04.160> that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
easy we're gonna check to make sure that

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.109 
easy we're gonna check to make sure that
our<00:02:05.350> switches<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.500> off<00:02:06.710> position<00:02:07.119> no

and<00:02:12.080> check<00:02:12.980> each<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.580> our<00:02:13.730> lead<00:02:13.910> wires<00:02:14.270> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and check each one of our lead wires to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.320 
and check each one of our lead wires to
make<00:02:15.410> sure<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:19.040> our<00:02:19.220> wires<00:02:19.490> are<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.180> good

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
make sure that our wires are in good

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.120 
shape there is no cracks no bare spots
we<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.480> by<00:02:26.720> running<00:02:26.900> our<00:02:27.170> fingers<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
we do this by running our fingers up the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
we do this by running our fingers up the
wire<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.730> visually<00:02:29.240> looking<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.940> then

wire and visually looking at it and then

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.970 
wire and visually looking at it and then
we<00:02:32.300> also<00:02:32.480> want<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> check<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.500> look<00:02:33.680> at<00:02:33.860> our

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
we also want to check and look at our

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.220 
we also want to check and look at our
clamp<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.580> make<00:02:34.730> sure<00:02:34.910> third<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.630> good<00:02:35.960> shape

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230

order

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.340 

we'll<00:02:54.090> turn<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.480> unit<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:57.080> making<00:02:58.080> sure<00:02:58.200> that
