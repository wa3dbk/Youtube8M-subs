00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
about doing that I get this question

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
about doing that I get this question
actually<00:00:19.199> part<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.099> why<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
actually part of it so that's why I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
actually part of it so that's why I
picked<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.820> certain<00:00:21.630> question<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.349> reason

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
picked this certain question some reason

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.040

to<00:00:22.770> me<00:00:22.919> this<00:00:23.099> question<00:00:23.460> seems<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.939> kind<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
to me this question seems like kind of
common<00:00:25.439> sense<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.919> I<00:00:26.130> guess<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.390> not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
common sense but I guess it's really not

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.370
