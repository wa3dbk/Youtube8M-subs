in HTML Javascript I actually wrote this

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
in HTML Javascript I actually wrote this
app<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.240> few<00:00:12.570> months<00:00:12.809> ago<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.320> worked<00:00:13.500> great

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
app a few months ago and it worked great

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740 
app a few months ago and it worked great
but<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.759> rewrote<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.480> morning

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
but I just rewrote it this morning

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.730 
but I just rewrote it this morning
originally<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.379> wrote<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.830> using<00:00:17.520> some<00:00:17.699> basic

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
originally I wrote it using some basic

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.420 
originally I wrote it using some basic
JavaScript<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:22.619> server<00:00:22.890> side<00:00:23.160> was

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
JavaScript and and the server side was

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.509 
JavaScript and and the server side was
mostly<00:00:23.789> bash<00:00:24.180> scripts<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.199> had<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.250> issues

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
mostly bash scripts I had some issues

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.060 
mostly bash scripts I had some issues
because<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> bad<00:00:27.330> habit<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.960> saving<00:00:28.830> my

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
because I have a bad habit of saving my

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.069 
because I have a bad habit of saving my
data<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> playing<00:00:29.760> text<00:00:30.090> files<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.250> if<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:33.079> put

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
data and playing text files so if we put

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.220 
data and playing text files so if we put
weird<00:00:34.800> characters<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.760> sometimes

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
weird characters and sometimes

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.510 
weird characters and sometimes
exclamation<00:00:37.230> marks<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> stuff<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:38.190> screw

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
exclamation marks and stuff would screw

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
exclamation marks and stuff would screw
up<00:00:38.670> our<00:00:38.850> shopping<00:00:39.329> list<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:40.680> I'd

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
up our shopping list and basically I'd

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.290 
up our shopping list and basically I'd
have<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.370> manually<00:00:41.790> remove<00:00:41.969> stuff<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
have to go into manually remove stuff so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.010 
have to go into manually remove stuff so
I<00:00:42.329> rewrote<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.719> using<00:00:43.620> jQuery<00:00:44.489> Mobile<00:00:45.020> using

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
I rewrote it using jQuery Mobile using

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
I rewrote it using jQuery Mobile using
Ajax<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> submit<00:00:47.610> stuff<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Ajax for some of the submit stuff so the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.049 
Ajax for some of the submit stuff so the
whole<00:00:48.270> page<00:00:48.480> doesn't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> reload<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
whole page doesn't have to reload and

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
whole page doesn't have to reload and
MySQL<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> database<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
MySQL for the database so this is the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
MySQL for the database so this is the
way<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> works<00:00:53.820> basically<00:00:54.510> me<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.440> wife<00:00:55.590> can

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
way it works basically me my wife can

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.270 
way it works basically me my wife can
both<00:00:55.890> logon<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.079> add<00:00:58.079> stuff<00:00:58.680> for

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
both logon to this and add stuff for

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
both logon to this and add stuff for
grocery<00:00:59.969> lists<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.660> whatnot<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
grocery lists and whatnot so when I get

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
grocery lists and whatnot so when I get
to<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> store<00:01:02.340> she<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.730> adding<00:01:03.030> stuff<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
to the store she can be adding stuff to
list<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> I'll<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.080> able<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
list and I'll be able to see it so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
list and I'll be able to see it so
basically<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.880> click<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.570> text<00:01:06.930> box<00:01:06.960> here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
basically I click in this text box here

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260 
basically I click in this text box here
and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> type<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.000> access

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and then I can type and I can access

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
and then I can type and I can access
some<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> regular<00:01:10.140> computer<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
some of this on a regular computer but I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.260 
some of this on a regular computer but I
can<00:01:11.100> also<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.750> voice<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:14.100> text<00:01:14.970> here

can also use my voice to to text here

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.170 
can also use my voice to to text here
and<00:01:15.540> basically<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> works<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> say

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and basically the way it works is I say

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
and basically the way it works is I say
the<00:01:18.540> name<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> store<00:01:19.229> followed<00:01:19.860> by<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the name of the store followed by a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
the name of the store followed by a
comma<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.850> each<00:01:21.060> item<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.890> followed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
comma and then each item I want followed

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
comma and then each item I want followed
by<00:01:23.189> another<00:01:23.520> comma<00:01:24.000> divided<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> comma

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
by another comma divided by a comma

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
by another comma divided by a comma
separated<00:01:25.020> by<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> comma<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.700> me

and I can add items and adding items
take<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> second<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.200> better<00:02:20.040> than<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
take a second because it's better than a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.059

free<00:02:20.610> puff<00:02:20.849> full-page<00:02:21.270> reload<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
free puff full-page reload here but you

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.130 
free puff full-page reload here but you
can<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.340> those<00:02:23.489> items<00:02:23.910> now<00:02:24.150> under<00:02:24.510> target<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
can see those items now under target you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.050 
can see those items now under target you
can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.530> divide<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.910> add

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
can see and divide it up and so if I add

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.780 
can see and divide it up and so if I add
more<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.330> Publix<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> would<00:02:27.900> add<00:02:28.020> them<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.260> here

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
more to Publix it would add them up here

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840 
more to Publix it would add them up here
and<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> each<00:02:31.770> things<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.220> its<00:02:32.340> own<00:02:32.520> little

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and so each things in its own little

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.080 
and so each things in its own little
group<00:02:33.060> real<00:02:33.780> easy<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.410> us<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.860> remove<00:02:35.700> stuff

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
group real easy for us to remove stuff

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
group real easy for us to remove stuff
now<00:02:36.330> before<00:02:36.690> my<00:02:36.810> old<00:02:36.989> script<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.770> would<00:02:37.890> have

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
now before my old script it would have

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
now before my old script it would have
to<00:02:38.130> completely<00:02:38.489> reload<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> page<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.900> now

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
to completely reload the page but now

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.250 
to completely reload the page but now
I'm<00:02:40.319> using<00:02:41.030> jQuery<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:43.160> some<00:02:44.160> Ajax<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.260> remove

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
I'm using jQuery and some Ajax to remove

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.990 
I'm using jQuery and some Ajax to remove
it<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.890> whole<00:02:47.010> page<00:02:47.310> doesn't<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.819> to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it so the whole page doesn't have to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
it so the whole page doesn't have to
refresh<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.569> it's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.959> bit<00:02:49.080> quicker<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
refresh so it's a little bit quicker to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.210 
refresh so it's a little bit quicker to
respond<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:52.230> happens<00:02:52.500> real<00:02:52.650> times<00:02:52.860> so

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
respond and it happens real times so

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.559 
respond and it happens real times so
then<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.670> any<00:02:53.819> point<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.060> i<00:02:54.120> refresh<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
then like at any point if i refresh the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.330 
then like at any point if i refresh the
page<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:54.959> my<00:02:55.049> wife<00:02:55.260> was<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.709> home<00:02:55.890> she<00:02:55.920> could<00:02:56.220> be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
page if my wife was at home she could be

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340 
page if my wife was at home she could be
adding<00:02:56.580> stuff<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.000> list<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.569> would<00:02:58.080> show
