and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.850> DJ's<00:01:15.210> did<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.450> amazing<00:01:15.780> job

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and I think that DJ's did an amazing job

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
and I think that DJ's did an amazing job
on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> instrumental<00:01:17.150> especially<00:01:18.150> since<00:01:18.509> he

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
on the instrumental especially since he

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300 
on the instrumental especially since he
hasn't<00:01:18.750> done<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.530> long<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hasn't done one and so long because it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.710 
hasn't done one and so long because it
is<00:01:20.430> his<00:01:21.030> wrist<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.159> been<00:01:23.159> taken<00:01:23.490> some

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
is his wrist and been taken some

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
is his wrist and been taken some
anti-inflammatory<00:01:24.720> stuff<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
anti-inflammatory stuff so it's a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.219 
anti-inflammatory stuff so it's a
congress<00:01:27.150> serious<00:01:27.450> yeah<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.110> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
congress serious yeah I think it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.999 
congress serious yeah I think it's
helping<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> uh<00:01:30.229> okay<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
helping and uh okay I think the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.999 
helping and uh okay I think the
discovers<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.470> next<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.829> there

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
discovers would be the next up there

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
discovers would be the next up there
with<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> best<00:01:35.280> yeah<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.329> mean<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:36.900> opinion

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
stuck it on top of the cameras they go
it<00:02:09.750> sounds<00:02:09.899> better<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.830> randomly<00:02:11.129> one

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it sounds better and then randomly one

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.559

we were to get that camera you'd be able
to<00:03:27.590> see<00:03:27.680> better<00:03:27.949> in<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.729> would<00:03:28.819> be

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
to see better in the all you would be

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.330 
to see better in the all you would be
better<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.689> the<00:03:30.199> focusing<00:03:30.680> would<00:03:30.829> be<00:03:30.949> even

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
better but the focusing would be even

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.860 
better but the focusing would be even
worse<00:03:31.370> than<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:31.970> one<00:03:32.180> which<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.750> lot<00:03:32.840> of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
worse than this one which a lot of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.179 
worse than this one which a lot of
people<00:03:32.930> complain<00:03:33.560> about<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:33.829> it's<00:03:33.949> hard<00:03:34.099> to

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
people complain about but it's hard to

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.399 
people complain about but it's hard to
make<00:03:34.310> focusing<00:03:34.790> good<00:03:34.939> on<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:37.269> Rita<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:39.139> far

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
make focusing good on the Rita it's far

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.659 
make focusing good on the Rita it's far
it's<00:03:39.650> hard<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.859> make<00:03:40.040> folks<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.400> good<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.639> a

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
it's hard to make folks a good on a

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.030 
it's hard to make folks a good on a
camera<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.060> has<00:03:41.329> an<00:03:41.840> aps-c<00:03:42.319> sensor<00:03:42.799> which<00:03:42.919> is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
camera that has an aps-c sensor which is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.339 
camera that has an aps-c sensor which is
a<00:03:43.069> pretty<00:03:43.250> big<00:03:43.430> sensor<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:44.569> they're<00:03:45.139> coming

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
a pretty big sensor but they're coming

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.659 
a pretty big sensor but they're coming
out<00:03:45.409> the<00:03:45.530> new<00:03:45.650> ones<00:03:45.889> soon<00:03:46.129> which<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.489> supposed

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
out the new ones soon which is supposed

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.129 
out the new ones soon which is supposed
to<00:03:46.819> address<00:03:47.269> all<00:03:47.449> these<00:03:47.569> problems<00:03:47.810> and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
to address all these problems and

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.390 
to address all these problems and
they're<00:03:48.229> coming<00:03:48.409> with<00:03:48.560> new<00:03:48.620> firmware<00:03:49.129> for<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
they're coming with new firmware for the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.589 
they're coming with new firmware for the
EOS<00:03:49.639> m<00:03:49.819> which<00:03:49.939> is<00:03:50.000> supposed<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.299> address<00:03:50.509> the

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
EOS m which is supposed to address the

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.149 
EOS m which is supposed to address the
problems<00:03:50.989> but<00:03:51.470> apparently<00:03:51.799> it's<00:03:51.919> mostly

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
problems but apparently it's mostly

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.979 
problems but apparently it's mostly
hardware<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:52.669> they<00:03:52.759> can't<00:03:52.939> really<00:03:52.970> fix<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.509> but

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
hardware so they can't really fix it but

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.149 
hardware so they can't really fix it but
when<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.199> new<00:03:54.319> camera<00:03:54.620> comes<00:03:54.769> out<00:03:54.919> could<00:03:55.099> be

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
when the new camera comes out could be

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.770 
when the new camera comes out could be
better<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.549> was<00:03:55.669> thinking<00:03:55.790> when<00:03:56.419> that<00:03:56.569> comes

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
better so I was thinking when that comes

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.479 
better so I was thinking when that comes
out<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.199> want<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.739> try<00:03:57.949> it<00:03:57.979> out<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:58.219> possibly

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
out I want to try it out and possibly

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.979 
out I want to try it out and possibly
replace<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.209> next<00:03:59.449> one<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.659> was<00:03:59.810> free

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
replace the next one that was free

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.289 
replace the next one that was free
doesn't<00:04:00.259> want<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.579> do<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.639> want<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.909> well<00:04:02.269> I

doesn't want to do you want to well I

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.670 
doesn't want to do you want to well I
don't<00:04:02.359> care<00:04:02.719> but<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.169> don't<00:04:03.290> want<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.469> spend
