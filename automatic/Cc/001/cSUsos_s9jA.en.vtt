00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.530
 and I am diego and we are on time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.460
 compare see me in true or false caves 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.950
 hi hello how are you good people 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.950
 helps to clean the shelter of the faces 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.920
 as after good the truth does not macarena 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.739
 because they did not like liquid is that the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.220
 true that as they appear like that if I know 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.860
 more still 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.720
 They are originally from South America, in fact 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.260
 They are the largest rodents in the world 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 those animals live in humid forests 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.000
 where there is where there are lagoons they 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.520
 I really like to get in the water then 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.460
 the hands are fixed on the front legs 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.250
 they have four fingers only and the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.050
 backs have only three fingers and 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 They have small membranes between 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.810
 each finger to be able to swim with a lot 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 speed 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 its main predators are the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 boas the anacondas and also the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.390
 crocodiles 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:39.270
 nothing more with herbs with grass can be 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.679
 a little fruit can give them vegetables 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.359
 It is not recommended in these 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.540
 very special facilities for 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:51.510
 can have them 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 from a distance it seems that it is not a very hair 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.710
 thorny very hard the one he has is very 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.570
 rough then and it's very separated and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.570
 so it looks like they were speed 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.310
 many thanks 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.690
 yes 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.470
 The capivara sleep in true caves or 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.480
 false fake spend the day in holes in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.150
 the mud or in the water to avoid the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.610
 heat to sleep are hidden among a 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.269
 Thick vegetation does not need them 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.700
 no cave we expected accompanied 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.120
