00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.269 
like the mock-up as I possibly can and I
haven't<00:00:26.490> named<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.910> thing<00:00:26.970> yet<00:00:27.449> but

like a headrest or a head pad it'll go

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.110 
like a headrest or a head pad it'll go
like<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.269> area<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.309> then<00:01:02.309> also<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
can see right there is three and a half

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
can see right there is three and a half
inches<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> ground<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.460> where

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
inches off the ground and that's where

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
inches off the ground and that's where
I'm<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.939> try<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> keep<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.369> that's<00:01:20.369> gonna

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
for the steering mechanism to go on the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.280 
for the steering mechanism to go on the
other<00:01:49.530> piece<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.570> came<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:51.840> some

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
of the other tractor parts I still have

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230 
of the other tractor parts I still have
fenders<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.500> these<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.430> parts<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
fenders but these are just parts that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
fenders but these are just parts that
came<00:01:57.420> off<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.670> disassembled<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> just

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
came off of the disassembled that I just

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
came off of the disassembled that I just
did<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.590> actually<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> use

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
did now I would actually like to use

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.660 
did now I would actually like to use
these<00:02:02.820> tires<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.450> guess<00:02:03.630> what

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
these tires but guess what

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.800 
these tires but guess what
damn<00:02:05.670> rim<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.509> seized<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.390> axle<00:02:09.390> there<00:02:09.570> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
damn rim is seized to the axle there so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.840 
damn rim is seized to the axle there so

right<00:03:33.670> here<00:03:33.730> will<00:03:34.060> actually<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.600> going

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
right here will actually be going

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.240 
right here will actually be going
underneath<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.549> seat<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.859> seat<00:03:39.040> looks

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
underneath the seat and this seat looks

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.650 
underneath the seat and this seat looks
pretty<00:03:39.459> rough<00:03:39.640> right<00:03:39.819> now<00:03:39.850> but<00:03:40.000> it'll

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
pretty rough right now but it'll

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.240 
pretty rough right now but it'll
actually<00:03:40.810> go<00:03:41.079> in<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.739> get<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.040> in

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
actually go in there just to get it in

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.400 
actually go in there just to get it in
the<00:03:42.940> right<00:03:43.090> angle<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.810> that's<00:03:44.019> gonna<00:03:44.230> be<00:03:44.380> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
the right angle and that's gonna be a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.660 
the right angle and that's gonna be a
seat<00:03:44.739> mount<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.160> it's<00:03:45.310> going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.549> pretty

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
seat mount so it's going to be pretty

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.610 
seat mount so it's going to be pretty
cool<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.420> engine<00:03:46.750> will<00:03:46.900> actually<00:03:47.230> lift<00:03:47.410> up

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
cool the engine will actually lift up

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.930 
cool the engine will actually lift up
just<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.950> little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.549> then<00:03:48.700> I'm<00:03:48.790> gonna

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
just a little bit and then I'm gonna

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.890 
just a little bit and then I'm gonna
trim<00:03:49.269> all<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.690> out<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.910> when<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.600> sets

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
trim all this out so that when it sets

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.809 
trim all this out so that when it sets
in<00:03:53.079> there<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.500> engine<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.130> up<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.489> little<00:03:54.700> bit

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
in there the engine is up a little bit

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.650 
in there the engine is up a little bit
higher<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.299> it'll<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.079> nice<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.290> clean<00:03:57.660> like

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
higher but it'll be nice and clean like

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020 
higher but it'll be nice and clean like
I<00:03:58.690> said<00:03:58.959> this<00:03:59.109> is<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.620> rude<00:03:59.829> mock<00:04:00.130> up<00:04:00.340> but

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
I said this is just a rude mock up but

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.080
