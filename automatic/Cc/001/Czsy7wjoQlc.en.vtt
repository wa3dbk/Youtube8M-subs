player start button that worked so I

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.280 
player start button that worked so I
start<00:01:46.510> playing<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.200> I'm<00:01:47.800> using<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.130> gun<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.550 
start playing and I'm using the gun and
nothing<00:01:50.290> it's<00:01:50.440> completely<00:01:51.040> firing<00:01:51.760> blank<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
nothing it's completely firing blank so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.650 
nothing it's completely firing blank so
I<00:01:53.890> calibrate<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.760> through<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.240> settings

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
I calibrate it through the settings

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.320 
I calibrate it through the settings
still<00:01:56.170> nothing<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.070> can't<00:01:57.340> get<00:01:57.550> I<00:01:57.760> can't<00:01:58.210> get

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
still nothing I can't get I can't get

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.660 
still nothing I can't get I can't get
the<00:01:58.420> gun<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.690> shoot<00:01:58.870> anything<00:01:59.580> so<00:02:00.580> I'm

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
the gun to shoot anything so I'm

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.090 
the gun to shoot anything so I'm
thinking<00:02:00.940> great<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.480> could<00:02:01.600> possibly<00:02:02.140> have<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
thinking great I could possibly have a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.870 
thinking great I could possibly have a
useless<00:02:03.880> cabinet<00:02:04.540> other<00:02:04.720> than<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:04.990> monitor

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
useless cabinet other than the monitor

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.339 
useless cabinet other than the monitor
so<00:02:06.880> let<00:02:07.540> me<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.750> give<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:07.960> some<00:02:08.050> more

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
so let me just give you some more

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.640 
so let me just give you some more
footage<00:02:08.739> here<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.509> decide<00:02:10.810> ok<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.440> don't<00:02:11.560> have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
footage here so I decide ok I don't have

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.050 
footage here so I decide ok I don't have
to<00:02:11.830> figure<00:02:12.069> out<00:02:12.190> what's<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.700> here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
to figure out what's going on here

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
to figure out what's going on here
because<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.629> calibrated<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.590> gun<00:02:14.739> over<00:02:15.010> there

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
because I calibrated the gun over there

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.620 
because I calibrated the gun over there
and<00:02:15.579> still<00:02:15.879> can't<00:02:16.150> get<00:02:16.299> any

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
worked on this button luckily this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.030 
worked on this button luckily this
wasn't<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:22.480> big<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.720> an<00:02:22.810> issue<00:02:22.930> all<00:02:23.770> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
wasn't too big of an issue all that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.650 
wasn't too big of an issue all that
happened<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.270> cherry

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
happened is that the little cherry

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
happened is that the little cherry
switch<00:02:26.290> or<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.560> leaf<00:02:26.830> switch<00:02:27.190> whatever<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
switch or the leaf switch whatever you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
switch or the leaf switch whatever you
want<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.850> call<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.660> wasn't<00:02:28.900> hooked<00:02:29.200> up<00:02:29.350> to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
want to call it it wasn't hooked up to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.280 
want to call it it wasn't hooked up to
the<00:02:29.560> button<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.280> when<00:02:30.430> you're<00:02:30.610> pushing<00:02:30.850> this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the button so when you're pushing this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.540 
the button so when you're pushing this
you<00:02:32.290> aren't<00:02:32.470> getting<00:02:32.590> any<00:02:32.920> signal<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you aren't getting any signal to the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180 
you aren't getting any signal to the
board<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.720> hooked<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.050> up<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
board so I just hooked that up and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.670 
board so I just hooked that up and
restarted<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.030> cabinet<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.530> was

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
restarted the cabinet and this one was

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.020 
restarted the cabinet and this one was
working<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> restarted<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.250> was<00:02:42.400> working<00:02:42.790> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
working so restarted it it was working I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.930 
working so restarted it it was working I
go<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.570> use<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.930> gun

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
go to use this gun

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750 
go to use this gun
nothing<00:02:45.940> I'm<00:02:46.270> getting<00:02:46.890> worse<00:02:47.890> than<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
nothing I'm getting worse than that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.280 
nothing I'm getting worse than that
thing<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.650> calibrate<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.770> still<00:02:51.160> nothing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
thing I calibrate it still nothing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.930 
thing I calibrate it still nothing
something<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.440> great<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.920> possibly<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.670> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
something and great I possibly have a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.920 
something and great I possibly have a
virtual<00:02:55.150> cop<00:02:55.480> too<00:02:55.720> with<00:02:56.530> too<00:02:56.860> bad<00:02:57.070> guns<00:02:57.930> now

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
virtual cop too with too bad guns now

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.470 
virtual cop too with too bad guns now
normally<00:02:59.670> someone<00:03:00.670> would<00:03:00.790> probably<00:03:01.330> go<00:03:01.450> out

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
normally someone would probably go out

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.050 
normally someone would probably go out
and<00:03:01.630> buy<00:03:01.810> some<00:03:02.290> some<00:03:03.010> more<00:03:03.040> guns<00:03:03.430> which<00:03:03.820> you

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
and buy some some more guns which you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.530 
and buy some some more guns which you
could<00:03:04.240> get<00:03:04.830> they're<00:03:05.830> not<00:03:05.980> too<00:03:06.460> expensive<00:03:06.540> if

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
could get they're not too expensive if

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.120 
could get they're not too expensive if
you<00:03:07.690> look<00:03:07.870> hard<00:03:08.050> enough<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.100> not

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
you look hard enough but it's not

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.220 
you look hard enough but it's not
exactly<00:03:09.610> cheap<00:03:09.940> either<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.020> replace

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
exactly cheap either to have to replace

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.750 
exactly cheap either to have to replace
two<00:03:11.530> guns<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:13.740> all<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:14.800> did<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.610> actually

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760

two guns well all I did is I actually
took<00:03:16.240> apart<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.660> guns<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.880> don't<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.060> if

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
took apart the guns and I don't know if

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 
took apart the guns and I don't know if
you<00:03:19.210> can<00:03:19.330> focus<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.260> see<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.740> lens

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
you can focus in but you see that lens

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.000 
you can focus in but you see that lens
right<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.930> both<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.140> them<00:03:23.290> were<00:03:23.680> really

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
right there both of them were really

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.930 
right there both of them were really
really<00:03:24.760> dusty<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.600> dirty<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.300> all<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.720> did<00:03:29.140> was

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
really dusty and dirty so all I did was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.970 
really dusty and dirty so all I did was
take<00:03:30.940> them<00:03:31.060> apart<00:03:31.180> took<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.230> took<00:03:32.590> each<00:03:32.830> of

those lenses off clean them got all the
dust<00:03:36.880> off<00:03:37.060> put<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.600> back<00:03:37.810> together<00:03:38.190> powered<00:03:39.190> on

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
dust off put it back together powered on

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.330 
dust off put it back together powered on
the<00:03:39.460> cabinet<00:03:40.650> calibrated<00:03:41.650> both<00:03:41.770> guns<00:03:42.040> again

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the cabinet calibrated both guns again

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.430 
the cabinet calibrated both guns again
and<00:03:42.690> voila<00:03:43.770> both<00:03:44.770> guns<00:03:45.070> were<00:03:45.220> working<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:47.110> this

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
and voila both guns were working so this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.699 
and voila both guns were working so this
went<00:03:47.770> from<00:03:48.360> possibly<00:03:49.360> being<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.930> useless<00:03:50.320> cab

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
went from possibly being a useless cab

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.050 
went from possibly being a useless cab
to<00:03:51.010> being<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.400> fully<00:03:51.790> working<00:03:52.390> cab<00:03:53.880> give<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.000> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
to being a fully working cab give you a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.670 
to being a fully working cab give you a
look<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.050> other<00:03:56.110> side

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.449 

so<00:04:00.610> as<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:01.000> can<00:04:01.120> see<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.930> not<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:03.250> know<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
so as you can see it's not you know the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.369 
so as you can see it's not you know the
best-looking<00:04:04.329> cabinet<00:04:04.780> does<00:04:05.049> have<00:04:05.230> some

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
best-looking cabinet does have some

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.509 
best-looking cabinet does have some
damage<00:04:05.799> no<00:04:06.040> biggie<00:04:07.680> t<00:04:08.680> molding<00:04:09.129> needs<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.400> be

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
damage no biggie t molding needs to be

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.690 
damage no biggie t molding needs to be
replaced<00:04:10.349> eventually<00:04:11.349> do<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.739> definitely

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
replaced eventually do that definitely

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.650 
replaced eventually do that definitely
needs<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:12.970> scrubbing<00:04:15.000> thing<00:04:16.000> looks<00:04:16.329> like<00:04:16.419> it's

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
needs a scrubbing thing looks like it's

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.289 
needs a scrubbing thing looks like it's
spent<00:04:16.959> its<00:04:17.139> lifetime<00:04:17.859> in<00:04:18.430> an<00:04:18.549> actual<00:04:18.850> arcade

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
spent its lifetime in an actual arcade

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.629 
spent its lifetime in an actual arcade
in<00:04:19.690> very<00:04:20.320> little<00:04:20.560> home<00:04:21.070> use<00:04:21.780> but<00:04:22.780> overall<00:04:23.639> I'd

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
in very little home use but overall I'd

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.070 
in very little home use but overall I'd
say<00:04:24.699> it's<00:04:25.060> pretty<00:04:25.150> good<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.780> let<00:04:28.870> me<00:04:28.930> go<00:04:29.050> ahead
