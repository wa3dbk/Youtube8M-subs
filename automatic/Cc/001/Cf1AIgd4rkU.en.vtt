00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
by beginning to bridge that and by

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
doing this well unless I built one of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.219 
doing this well unless I built one of
them<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:43.070> music<00:01:44.070> box<00:01:44.340> things<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.960> thinking

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
them on music box things I was thinking

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
them on music box things I was thinking
about<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.590> setting<00:01:47.159> something<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.549> like

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
about actually setting something up like

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.840 
about actually setting something up like
that<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> big<00:01:49.289> clap<00:01:49.770> board<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> could

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that as a big clap board so I could

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
that as a big clap board so I could
synchronize<00:01:51.329> video<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.929> audio<00:01:52.049> from

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
synchronize video and audio from

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
synchronize video and audio from
separate<00:01:52.860> sources<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.759> being<00:01:54.479> recorded<00:01:54.840> two

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
separate sources or being recorded two

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.529 
separate sources or being recorded two
separate<00:01:55.619> tracks<00:01:55.920> whatever<00:01:56.490> dang<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> i'm

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
separate tracks whatever dang it i'm

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.969 
separate tracks whatever dang it i'm
already<00:01:57.840> screwing<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.560> bridge<00:01:58.950> oh<00:02:00.979> yeah

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
already screwing up this bridge oh yeah

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.919 
already screwing up this bridge oh yeah
I<00:02:02.009> forgot<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.490> left<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.909> exposed<00:02:03.299> hole<00:02:03.630> there

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
I forgot I left that exposed hole there

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.340 
I forgot I left that exposed hole there
so<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:06.030> hoping<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.479> ain't<00:02:06.810> too<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.319> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so I'm hoping that ain't too much of a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.380 
so I'm hoping that ain't too much of a
problem<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:10.400> don't<00:02:11.400> hear<00:02:11.670> any<00:02:11.790> creatures<00:02:12.150> yet

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
problem I don't hear any creatures yet

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.780 
problem I don't hear any creatures yet
which<00:02:13.019> makes<00:02:13.260> me<00:02:13.380> think<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.769> maybe<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
which makes me think that maybe I got to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.280 
which makes me think that maybe I got to
be<00:02:14.880> within<00:02:15.030> range<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.450> some<00:02:15.599> spawners<00:02:15.900> first

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
be within range of some spawners first

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.449 
be within range of some spawners first
which<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.340> am<00:02:17.489> NOT<00:02:17.730> yeah<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.019> are<00:02:19.459> so

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
which I am NOT yeah there they are so

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
area directly there were all the passes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.710 
area directly there were all the passes
their<00:02:39.000> webs<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.660> door<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.329> was<00:02:45.480> my

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
their webs in the door well that was my

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.920 
their webs in the door well that was my
doing<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.260> I'll<00:02:46.530> take<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:50.180> yep<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.510> that's

doing but I'll take it yep see that's

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.550 
doing but I'll take it yep see that's
why<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.380> gonna<00:02:52.530> close<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.799> gap

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.180 

I<00:02:56.569> hear<00:02:57.569> like<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> bazillion<00:02:58.170> creatures<00:02:58.770> die<00:02:58.950> at

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
I hear like a bazillion creatures die at

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.540 
I hear like a bazillion creatures die at
once<00:03:00.290> which<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> little<00:03:01.680> bit<00:03:01.860> disconcerting

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
once which is a little bit disconcerting

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.620 
once which is a little bit disconcerting
because<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:03.000> means<00:03:03.150> there's<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.599> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
because that means there's like a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.330 
because that means there's like a
million<00:03:03.900> creatures<00:03:04.440> capable<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:05.069> spawning

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
million creatures capable of spawning

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.600 
million creatures capable of spawning
here<00:03:06.140> which<00:03:07.140> scares<00:03:07.800> me<00:03:10.040> alright<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> got

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
here which scares me alright so I got

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.020 
here which scares me alright so I got
this<00:03:12.000> big<00:03:12.560> seal<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.860> glass<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.250> bedrock

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
this big seal in a glass and bedrock

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.100 
this big seal in a glass and bedrock
here<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.610> don't<00:03:18.360> know<00:03:18.569> how<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.810> feel<00:03:19.019> about

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
here and I don't know how to feel about

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.190 
here and I don't know how to feel about
it<00:03:19.530> I've<00:03:19.709> got<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.920> skylight<00:03:20.280> down<00:03:20.790> there<00:03:21.200> huh

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
it I've got a skylight down there huh

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.740 
it I've got a skylight down there huh
that's<00:03:22.620> interesting<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.610> seems<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.510> I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
that's interesting it seems like if I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.699 
that's interesting it seems like if I
went<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:27.060> soul<00:03:27.540> sand<00:03:27.930> pillar

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
went up here in that soul sand pillar

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.080 
went up here in that soul sand pillar
and<00:03:28.980> i<00:03:29.730> took<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:30.269> each<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.290> these<00:03:31.519> arms<00:03:32.519> here

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and i took out each of these arms here

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.870 
and i took out each of these arms here
that<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.470> would<00:03:34.620> greatly<00:03:34.950> improved<00:03:35.610> my

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that it would greatly improved my

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.350 
that it would greatly improved my
visibility<00:03:36.269> down<00:03:36.780> there<00:03:37.430> which<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.640> very

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
visibility down there which is a very

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.970 
visibility down there which is a very
clever<00:03:39.720> thing<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:40.319> veges<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.830> do<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.980> I'm

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
clever thing for veges to do so I'm

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.460 
clever thing for veges to do so I'm
wondering<00:03:44.269> if<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.660> try<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:45.900> climb<00:03:46.410> up

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
wondering if I just try and climb up

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.120 
wondering if I just try and climb up
this<00:03:46.920> thing<00:03:46.980> use<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> as<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> spiral<00:03:48.450> staircase

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
this thing use it as a spiral staircase

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.059 
this thing use it as a spiral staircase
of<00:03:50.130> course<00:03:50.400> brick<00:03:50.730> takes<00:03:51.120> forever<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.540> break

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
of course brick takes forever to break

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.479 
of course brick takes forever to break
so<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.400> might<00:03:53.760> not<00:03:53.940> be<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.239> brightest<00:03:55.489> well

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
so that might not be the brightest well

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.270 
so that might not be the brightest well
TNT<00:03:57.239> would<00:03:57.450> make<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> lot<00:03:58.049> quicker<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
TNT would make that a lot quicker but I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.140 
TNT would make that a lot quicker but I
used<00:03:59.549> all<00:03:59.700> my<00:03:59.760> tnt<00:04:00.239> back<00:04:01.109> in<00:04:01.440> my<00:04:01.620> other<00:04:01.890> video

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
used all my tnt back in my other video

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.740 
used all my tnt back in my other video
when<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.359> got<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.690> lime<00:04:03.900> green<00:04:04.200> wool<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:06.420> I

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
when I got the lime green wool and so I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.229 
when I got the lime green wool and so I
don't<00:04:07.019> exactly<00:04:07.350> have<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:08.000> great<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.180> to

don't exactly have a great way to

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:37.560 
don't exactly have a great way to
resupply<00:04:09.690> that

this<00:05:47.410> might<00:05:47.620> not<00:05:47.800> be<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.040> best<00:05:48.280> way<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.550> do

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
this might not be the best way to do

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.190 
this might not be the best way to do
this<00:05:48.910> is<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:51.610> would<00:05:51.730> be<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:51.850> lot<00:05:52.060> quicker<00:05:52.330> now

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
this is it would be a lot quicker now

I can climb up that pretty quick way
quicker<00:06:06.250> than<00:06:06.520> up<00:06:06.760> breaking<00:06:07.120> through<00:06:07.450> a<00:06:07.480> bunch

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
interestingly enough seems to have

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.249 
interestingly enough seems to have
seeped<00:06:39.759> in<00:06:40.000> a<00:06:40.030> little<00:06:40.330> bit<00:06:40.449> right<00:06:40.690> there<00:06:40.720> i

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259

seeped in a little bit right there i
wonder<00:06:41.770> if<00:06:41.800> that's<00:06:42.069> any<00:06:42.460> significance<00:06:43.300> but

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
wonder if that's any significance but

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.439 
wonder if that's any significance but
anyway<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:45.280> most<00:06:45.460> important<00:06:45.910> thing<00:06:45.940> i<00:06:46.180> can<00:06:46.360> do

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
anyway the most important thing i can do

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.770 
anyway the most important thing i can do

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
right now is dig out enough of this that

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.379 
right now is dig out enough of this that
