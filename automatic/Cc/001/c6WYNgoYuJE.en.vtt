00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 so maybe wondering what sees 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.430
 ron then well that no i stands for gas 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.950
 and a specific in the Netherlands 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 green gas there is a very extensive video 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.680
 made over green grass backgrounds 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.420
 but I'll give you the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.290
 still give management summary 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 green gas is generated with river sludge 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.630
 manure garden waste is then planted 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 and gas made of it and it will be 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.520
 natural gas network that bound 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 very very school very very low co2 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.469
 not just emit from your wheel and thinks 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 the 6v but from the thinking but also 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.760
 Just a called the wielders from there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 is actually doing nothing fuel 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 green gas also scores very well in this regard 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 he is the 3 3 drum I will soon be with 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.740
 start the use the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.210
 14% addition in this class 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.190
 of course some cars that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.790
 but again not very much 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.910
 and want to drive around in an environmentally friendly way 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.790
 CO2 emissions from a car on green gas 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.760
 is just lower than mine together 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.800
 live 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.080
 a child also fantastic but how does it work 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.330
 then call that old Jan in the car 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.460
 advantage that they are with a clean slate 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 started with that mqb platform that term 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.750
 often passed the modular 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.610
 construction method which they immediately take into account 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.610
 have been able to keep up with the arrival of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.830
 plug-in hybrid version but also with this one 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.780
 Green gas version where adding or 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.510
 cars on cng 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.300
 natural gas they are natural care compress then 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.140
 you would have to post when you think of 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.660
 awkward places 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 but here in the a3 you actually have just 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.210
 as much luggage space as in the a3 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.210
 quattro 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 in terms of motorization a fast bin is the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.830
 choice easy there will be a one ip it 4 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.050
 taizÃ© with estron I bake to obtain 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.600
 so no manual gearbox with double coupling 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 unfortunately may not switch itself now 1.4tsi 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.070
 target has 110 hp 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.380
 200 new torque to be measured it is anyway 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.420
 a striker but thanks to the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.070
 estrone I'll bake you all with easily 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.000
 you just think the traffic opinion bin 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.430
 nice with you 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.990
 is also just snow couple switch 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 of course I am not a figure either 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.500
 unimportant 10.8 sonder 100 to heavyweight 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.360
 197 km per hour but you know I have 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.640
 prefer something more but something else 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.920
 to give a car with fourteen cents 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.600
 to get more viewer with 14 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 percent at the rick then it is 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.810
 a little bit 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760
 from driving on green gas you notice 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.780
 nothing else your foot actually 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.569
 switch as it used to with any 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.489
 no thing that we guess here is lingo 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.920
 in terms of on-board computer you have a few more options 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.409
 to get a picture of the range 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.750
 only running on green gas or 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.340
 combined with gasoline 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 thanks to the fact that there is just one 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.980
 petrol tank came to cover her 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.400
 Mirror Force is a total of around 14 100 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.969
 km 400 km on green gas 1000 km 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.159
 machine 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.379
 Plus minus was what I was driving 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.389
 the now doing where that is just one 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.750
 very long in which of course you 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.870
 maybe wondering where am I going to refuel green gas 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.510
 it can no longer be used everywhere 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.620
 many places in 125 gas stations 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.139
 The Netherlands 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.909
 they often lie just after they quickly 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.139
 sometime you'll roll a little piece of it 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.370
 have to detour 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:49.379
 but the whole relationship does it 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.980
 you not to be and basic version costs 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.740
 28,900 euros apart a bit nice 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.930
 dress up and keep it 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.400
 feels successful package pro line s package 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.480
 The color just all need your 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.820
 not to the rest of the neighborhood 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.350
 radiate that your 14% bijtell came 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.450
 configure a nice one too 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.440
 whatever not unkind sorry too 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.240
 realize 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.370
 very clean in addition to some green gas 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.980
 fuel it is also not expensive 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.990
 the price is now about a euro 6 and 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.940
 not linked to the oil price so there 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.940
 you will not get a big rise in it
