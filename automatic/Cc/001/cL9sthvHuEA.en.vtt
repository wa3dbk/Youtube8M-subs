00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 like the idea that this game saga 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
 for consoles since it was a game of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.360
 terror that hit too much in the world of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.550

 of pay and many people consider this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 much more accessible tool than 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 other engine to create video games already 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 that the others cost a lot more money 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.640
 but still if you do not want to spend anything 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.409

 started for free 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.490
 after having fame and several versions 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.340
 the creators of the first version 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.280
 out of the eight pages they decided 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.680
 create the under man the heart arrival 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.270

 lenderman horrors only this time 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.130
 will have a story and some graphics 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.080
 much more serious and much better than 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 free versions as you know 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.780
 because this game had tremendous success 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 since little by little we could see 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.890
 Well I was following your page 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.050
 on facebook I could have noticed that every 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.820
 once I had more achievements one of these was 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.800
 that was no longer sold let's say that when 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.539
 they sold it they sold it they are the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 Assemblies gave it to their customers 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.410
 medium of the internet after they could 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 sell your game on the platform 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.180
 have allowed at a time in the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 steam platform and good in steam there 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.570
 many people many customers who buy 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.400
 games for pc as there are sometimes out 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 very cheap I remember this game 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.180
 it has always been cheap it came out as in 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.780
 five dollars and then for five dollars 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 for this one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.970
 this game looked perfect it would be very 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.069
 well because he was hitting too much and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.420
 right now something I've seen 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.490
 lately has pressed me are the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.860
 ads is this class for consoles 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.319
 and another is one that I saw that said it comes out 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.209
 with the announcement of online interaction not 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.300
 writer 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.970
 bayern things like interactions in 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.470
 line are not qualified approved by 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.600
 the srb and this I get many ads 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.030
 I say many games that have 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.830
 online interactions and I have not played 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.739
 a lot this game the truth I have not seen 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.880
 a lot of it but I did not know what I had 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.980
 online interactions 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 this may be new since lately 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.850
 this game 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.830
 the company of the wireless studios has 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 confirmed that there will be 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.410
 game updates for those who 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.510
 they have already bought it on pc they are going to have 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.670
 those free updates if you give it to you 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.800
 you are going to buy on xbox 360 would allow us 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.480
 if you're not going to buy consoles this game 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.940
 it's not going to be just that we have company going 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 to have new things and with this that 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.650
 I'm seeing online, maybe I can 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.950
 have and I think he's going to have a class 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 of boards where you can see the records 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.570
 yours and those of your friends how long 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.790
 they have survived survived cons 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.670
 lenderman or maybe there is a way 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.640
 multiplayer would be I think something very good and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.730
 multiplayer about the players not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.350
 you imagine 24 players on the map and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.690
 escaping from zeeland sister to see who 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.300
 is the one that is first caught something else 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.650
 what I think is this that is strange 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.660
 let this game come out so that our 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.760
 people playstation3 being a very game 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.410
 heavy for pc those who have 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.600
 downloaded and played for many pc 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.460
 talking because it's too heavy for 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.920
 certain machines for example my pc has 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.930
 i5 processor that is very good 8 gigas 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.700
 from ram 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.609
 where the shit is that it's a laptop 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.650
 a video chip of the hd graphics 3000 no 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.100
 is very bad with this chip and could play 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.350
 games like 'crisis and 6-3 in 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.539
 very low characteristics but I have 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.440
 could play this at a minimum in a 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.930
 resolution of 720 but the game of 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.180
 schlinder man I could not play this 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.220
 game in the lowest resolution 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.229
 the lowest graphs and I could tell you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.389
 I wish a bit of the fuck jala really 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.440
 bad but then there is 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.720
 I believe that for these updates 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.580
 the game will be lighter because 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 principle did not this company that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.330
 let's hope it's a company that does not have 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.979
 a lot of experience creating videogames 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.080
 like those of the call of duty that 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.030
 they make very detailed maps many 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.530
 objects and their games are not very heavy 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 in fact because the games carlos 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.300
 Useful mini laptop pulls great games 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.580
 like the modern warfare with which they 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.410
 they look very very very full on maps this 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.900
 game because you do not usually fray much 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.560
 you see many trees and it is very 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.110
 heavy for the pc this already for good not 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.639
 is that it is very heavy but it is like a 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.939
 game that if you need 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.919
 a good processor I think more than 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.389
 nothing the video card in my case my 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.759
 laptop recessed because because the chip 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.830
 life is crap but neither is 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.610
 anything is Ireland competing to 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.379
 the consoles 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.439
 then I play this game in my opinion what 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:37.509
 I saw more as an art for xbox one and 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.999
 for playstation 4 I do not know what it's called 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.310
 some little games that sell separately for 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.960
 playstation but I still saw it like that 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.569
 as a small game since for example 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.069
 the games of xbox when play 4 those of 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.860
 new generation are games that start 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.110
 60 gigas and this game I think it has to 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.300
 Regret is not for pc I think playing 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.919
 installed weighs less than 10 gigabytes 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.790
 It would be perfect as an arcade for 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.650
 these consoles I do not know what is your opinion 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.930
 I hope you liked the video friends 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.690
 please this subscribe share the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.100
 video if they liked it and then put in the 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.320
 comment box what do you think about that 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:16.080
 this game comes out for consoles 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.560
 bye after this guy does not turn us on 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.560
 what awaits 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.250
 bitch more
