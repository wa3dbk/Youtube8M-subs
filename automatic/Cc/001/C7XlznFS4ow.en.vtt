00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:17.080
 Before liing was the big issue 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 and we want to occupy ourselves today 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.500
 with the regulation of the glycogen 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.030
 Metabolism There are two 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.480
 key enzymes and indeed an enzyme that 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.190
 builds up the glycogen and an enzyme of the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.109
 portals lyko conditions and build 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.940
 that's what glycogen synthase is all about 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:47.769
 responsible and for the dismantling is the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.899
 glycogen phosphorase responsible for that 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.719
 a start of construction on the other cities 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.719
 Last turn off the regulation of this 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:00.449
 both so the key is how much 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.729
 Glykogen is degraded or produced 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.090
 Altogether one can say when the enzymes 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.820
 are active and that is the glycogen 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.820
 synthase active when we reach the high 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.229
 have blood pressure and logos mirror and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.299
 the calm and a phosphorus 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.170
 Low glucose levels are so smart 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.090
 and want to make genese and therefore the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:28.390
 energy from the duo go out 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:31.060
 thus , the offices are needed 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:37.750
 synthase and the rest of the fund nose 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:40.719
 in a sense antagonist two 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.749
 basic principles are relevant to this 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.030
 to understand biogenic metabolism 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.640
 First, that it's a hormonal mix 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.979
 and allosteric regulation is so 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.499
 On the one hand, the two enzymes are over 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.429
 hoods without regulated on the other hand also 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:02:03.219
 about allosteric reaction products 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:06.189
 activated or inhibited the second is 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:10.090
 that the enzymes of hunger metabolism 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:13.630
 what is the glucose phosphorus in the nose? 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.090
 entire carbohydrate metabolism through 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.690
 fund 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.489
 Government are activated and enzymes 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.280
 the saturation metabolism for example 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.849
 theories synthase will be in the same train 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:34.760
 when the funds are formulated in 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:35.950
 activates the glycogen synthase there is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.239
 in a form 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 There she is quite normal in the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.590
 cell and is not formulated briskly 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.680
 and is active the green frame should 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.019
 they actively mean the glycogen 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.239
 but synthase can now by a 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.000
 hormonal influence are inactivated 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.930
 then it is called glycogen synthase vom 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.220
 b denote 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 and that if it is formulated briskly 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.780
 then she is interactive and the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.129
 Formulation can be done with the help of protein 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.620
 kinase happen 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.220
 that is, when glucagon docked chmp 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.879
 cascada then raises the fees 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.220
 be inactivated synthase now said 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.060
 me yes that's a mix 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.030
 allosteric and hormonal 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.530
 Regulation is the enzyme 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.639
 influenced and which is now a 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.609
 hormonal influence over the 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.310
 protein kinase a there is now 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.040
 also a glycogen synthase of the form b 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.310
 the active one is so although they are 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.680
 formulates this to a certain extent active and 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.620
 that comes through the Allosteric 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.500
 mechanism , though 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 glucose is 6 o'clock then this can be in 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.560
 active form despite phosphorylation 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.660
 So there is also one activated 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.540
 active form of the lupo gene synthase b at 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:03.079
 the hypo gen phosphor nose is present 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:07.160
 that's a bit more complicated and that is 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.989
 is the first time in the form b available 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.470
 in the non- pre-formulated form 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.150
 and if there is nothing then that is 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.070
 first time in active so this now 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.750
 constitutively inactive if you are not 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:24.050
 she can not be formulated in her 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.840
 formulated funds 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.310
 with help 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.110
 allosteric mechanisms and though 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.970
 We have many museums of mono-phosphate 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.210
 then they can not 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:40.040
 Formulated form of hypo genforschung 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.570
 nose will be activated that is now the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.560
 Allosteric influence because we have 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.440
 said there is still one 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.380
 hormonal influence and hormonal 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.960
 Influence was over the way 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.410
 because it can work through 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.860
 phosphorylation activation of 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.480
 glycogen phosphorus nose and the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.370
 phosphorylation does not do that here 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.220
 protein kinase a so-called 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:10.430
 fund in front of the nose but will 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:14.180
 activated by the protein kinase so the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.450
 postulated form is so active can 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.170
 but through allosteric mechanisms 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.750
 that is, if we are inactivated 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.310
 then you can have a high glucose level 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.860
 let the glycogen phosphorus 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.380
 allosteric activates anyway 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.540
 she is frantically formulated and thus her 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.540
 actually should be active 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.190
 That was a basic principle of the glycogen 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.660
 metabolism ie the regulation of the 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.020
 glycogen metabolism 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.000
 thanks for the attention and 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.000
 See you at the next video
