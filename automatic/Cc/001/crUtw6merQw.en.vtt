00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
really not going to work out well now if

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.439 
really not going to work out well now if
you<00:00:50.070> don't<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.760> sensitivity<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you don't know what your sensitivity is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
you don't know what your sensitivity is
that's<00:00:51.719> fine<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.350> figure<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that's fine you can figure it out really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's fine you can figure it out really
easily<00:00:53.340> well<00:00:54.239> first<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.719> my<00:00:54.989> sensitivity

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
easily well first of all my sensitivity

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
easily well first of all my sensitivity
is<00:00:55.739> 5<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> run<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is 5 that's what I run so that's that's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
is 5 that's what I run so that's that's
got<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> question<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.890> just

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
got that question out of the way I just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
got that question out of the way I just
kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> picked<00:00:59.910> 5<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> felt<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
kind of picked 5 because it felt like it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
kind of picked 5 because it felt like it
did<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.649> modern<00:01:01.890> warfare<00:01:02.039> 2<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.699> had<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
did in modern warfare 2 I think I had it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
did in modern warfare 2 I think I had it
on<00:01:03.030> 5<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.840> 6<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.260> modern<00:01:04.470> warfare<00:01:04.589> 2<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on 5 or 6 in modern warfare 2 and it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
on 5 or 6 in modern warfare 2 and it
felt<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> same<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.270> decided

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
felt kind of the same so I just decided

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
felt kind of the same so I just decided
to<00:01:06.720> keep<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> had<00:01:08.610> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to keep it so if you if you had that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
to keep it so if you if you had that
comfortable<00:01:09.270> sensitivity<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
comfortable sensitivity that you know of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
comfortable sensitivity that you know of
then<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:12.030> really

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
then go for that but if you don't really

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
then go for that but if you don't really
know<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.720> sensitivity<00:01:13.350> works<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> my

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
know what sensitivity works for you my

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.940 
know what sensitivity works for you my
advice<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:14.990> start<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> 3<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
advice is this start out on 3 that's the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
advice is this start out on 3 that's the
default<00:01:17.310> sensitivity<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:18.780> what

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
default sensitivity and that's what

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.420 
default sensitivity and that's what
you're<00:01:19.290> probably<00:01:19.619> already<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.950> already<00:01:20.280> if

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you're probably already on already if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
you're probably already on already if
you<00:01:20.549> haven't<00:01:20.820> changed<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.299> once<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> feel

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you haven't changed it once you feel

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.719 
you haven't changed it once you feel
comfortable<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.490> play

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
comfortable with that you know play

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
comfortable with that you know play
quite<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> few<00:01:24.270> games<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> move<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> 4

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
quite a few games with it move up to 4

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
quite a few games with it move up to 4
see<00:01:26.580> how<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:26.939> four<00:01:27.299> play<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.780> maybe<00:01:28.110> 10

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
see how you do on four play no maybe 10

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
see how you do on four play no maybe 10
15<00:01:29.009> 20<00:01:29.640> games<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.420> enough<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> used<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
15 20 games do enough to get used to it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260 
15 20 games do enough to get used to it
and<00:01:31.619> find<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.310> too<00:01:32.520> high<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.090> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and find out if it's too high for you if

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
and find out if it's too high for you if
it's<00:01:33.689> too<00:01:33.869> high<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's too high then back back down if it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399 
it's too high then back back down if it
seems<00:01:35.970> perfect<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.020> would<00:01:37.229> probably

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
seems perfect then I would probably

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
seems perfect then I would probably
still<00:01:37.829> move<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> can

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
still move it up or if you think you can

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
still move it up or if you think you can
go<00:01:39.299> higher<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.780> ahead<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.020> move<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.380> once

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
go higher go ahead and move it up once

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.780 
go higher go ahead and move it up once
again<00:01:40.939> now<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.360> 5<00:01:42.659> play<00:01:43.320> another<00:01:43.530> 10<00:01:43.920> 15<00:01:44.159> 20

games<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> feel<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
games see how you feel if you want to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
games see how you feel if you want to
move<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.799> again<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.369> again<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.880> whatever

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
move it up again go up again do whatever

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
move it up again go up again do whatever
you<00:01:48.329> want<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.780> keep<00:01:48.990> doing<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.500> until

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you want and just keep doing this until

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.550 
you want and just keep doing this until
you<00:01:50.250> feel<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.939> uncomfortable<00:01:51.380> once<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you feel kind of uncomfortable once you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
you feel kind of uncomfortable once you
feel<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.310> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> missing<00:01:53.850> your

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
feel like you're kind of missing your

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
feel like you're kind of missing your
shots<00:01:54.479> long<00:01:54.750> range<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> losing

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
shots long range you're kind of losing

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
shots long range you're kind of losing
gunfights<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.030> back<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.390> down<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
gunfights then I would back it down to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.569 
gunfights then I would back it down to
levels<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:58.560> least<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.189> usually<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
levels or at least one but usually to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
levels or at least one but usually to
you<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you really really really want to be

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
you really really really want to be
comfortable<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.399> sensitivity<00:02:02.820> guys

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
comfortable with your sensitivity guys

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
comfortable with your sensitivity guys
you<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.840> close<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.500> hipfire<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.460> got

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you know up close that hipfire it's got

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370 
you know up close that hipfire it's got
to<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> perfect<00:02:06.060> hip<00:02:06.420> fire<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> but

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to be that perfect hip fire for you but

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.839 
to be that perfect hip fire for you but
then<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.649> forget<00:02:07.829> aiming<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:08.369> sight<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
then don't forget aiming down sight is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
then don't forget aiming down sight is
slower<00:02:09.239> than<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> hipfire<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> got<00:02:11.129> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
slower than the hipfire so you got to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
slower than the hipfire so you got to
figure<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.610> which<00:02:12.030> balance<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.750> good<00:02:12.900> for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
figure out which balance is good for

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.280 
figure out which balance is good for
that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.569 
that
you<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:13.409> which<00:02:13.620> aim-down-sight<00:02:14.219> is<00:02:14.340> fast

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
you know which aim-down-sight is fast

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.130 
you know which aim-down-sight is fast
enough<00:02:14.849> for<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:15.390> hipfire<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.930> good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
enough for you which hipfire is good

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860 
enough for you which hipfire is good
enough<00:02:16.609> it's<00:02:17.609> all<00:02:17.760> personal<00:02:18.090> preference<00:02:18.510> guys

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
enough it's all personal preference guys

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.729 
enough it's all personal preference guys
now<00:02:19.680> um<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.219> would<00:02:20.459> say<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.329> above<00:02:21.739> seven

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
now um I would say don't go above seven

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.440 
now um I would say don't go above seven
or<00:02:22.859> eight<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.459> probably<00:02:23.819> seven<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.269> should

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
or eight it's probably seven it should

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.449 
or eight it's probably seven it should
be<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.689> highest<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> don't<00:02:25.739> go<00:02:25.890> below<00:02:26.159> two<00:02:26.219> if

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
be the highest and don't go below two if

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.500 
be the highest and don't go below two if
you're<00:02:26.579> below<00:02:26.730> two<00:02:26.819> you're<00:02:27.150> never<00:02:27.299> going<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you're below two you're never going to

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.630 
you're below two you're never going to
be<00:02:27.599> able<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.810> turn<00:02:27.989> around<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.799> know<00:02:29.370> try

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
be able to turn around so you know try

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.089 
be able to turn around so you know try
to<00:02:29.670> stay<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.329> two<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.930> seven<00:02:31.379> range<00:02:31.650> maybe

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
to stay in that two to seven range maybe

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.229 
to stay in that two to seven range maybe
maybe<00:02:32.549> more<00:02:32.819> around<00:02:33.030> four<00:02:33.269> five<00:02:33.569> six<00:02:34.700> uh<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
maybe more around four five six uh you

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.890 
maybe more around four five six uh you
know<00:02:36.359> my<00:02:37.079> philosophy<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:38.099> on<00:02:39.000> sensitivity<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
know my philosophy on on sensitivity is

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.259 
know my philosophy on on sensitivity is
this<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.739> higher<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:41.700> while<00:02:42.030> being

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
this the higher you can go while being

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.449 
this the higher you can go while being
comfortable<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.650> best<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
comfortable with it is the best for you

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.119 
comfortable with it is the best for you
so<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> high<00:02:46.109> sensitivity<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
so you know with a high sensitivity you

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.190 
so you know with a high sensitivity you
can<00:02:47.340> turn<00:02:47.579> faster<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.659> on<00:02:48.780> target

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
can turn faster you can get on target

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720 
can turn faster you can get on target
faster<00:02:49.409> which<00:02:49.769> means<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.129> can<00:02:50.280> get<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.519> shot

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
faster which means you can get the shot

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.979 
faster which means you can get the shot
off<00:02:50.790> quicker<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.329> you're<00:02:51.419> usually<00:02:51.659> going<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
off quicker and you're usually going to

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.229 
off quicker and you're usually going to
win<00:02:52.169> your<00:02:52.260> gunfights<00:02:52.709> because<00:02:53.129> of<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.459> but

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
win your gunfights because of that but

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.390 
win your gunfights because of that but
if<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.930> uncomfortable<00:02:55.079> with<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:56.099> if<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
if you're uncomfortable with that if you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
if you're uncomfortable with that if you
if<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.790> can't<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.269> get<00:02:57.419> on<00:02:57.540> target<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.900> mean

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
if you can't really get on target I mean

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.539 
if you can't really get on target I mean
you<00:02:58.139> can<00:02:58.260> turn<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.709> can't<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.129> target

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you can turn but you can't get on target

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.729 
you can turn but you can't get on target
then<00:02:59.879> that's<00:03:00.090> worse<00:03:00.389> for<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.500> got<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
then that's worse for you so you got to

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.710 
then that's worse for you so you got to
find<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> highest<00:03:02.340> sensitivity<00:03:02.790> possible

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
find the highest sensitivity possible

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.539 
find the highest sensitivity possible
for<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.470> you're<00:03:04.620> still<00:03:04.739> comfortable<00:03:05.400> at

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
for you that you're still comfortable at

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.309 
for you that you're still comfortable at
and<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.939> aim<00:03:06.150> well<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:06.659> that<00:03:07.200> would

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
and can aim well so that would

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.199 
and can aim well so that would
definitely<00:03:07.709> be<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.829> best<00:03:08.159> now<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.000> lot

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
definitely be the best now I know a lot

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.059 
definitely be the best now I know a lot
of<00:03:09.269> professional<00:03:10.049> players<00:03:10.230> play<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.769> kind<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
of professional players play on kind of

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.429 
of professional players play on kind of
three<00:03:11.459> four<00:03:11.700> five<00:03:12.060> range<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.290> you're

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
three four five range and if you're

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.780 
three four five range and if you're
having<00:03:13.560> trouble<00:03:14.069> kind<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.400> moving<00:03:14.669> your

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
having trouble kind of moving your

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.759 
having trouble kind of moving your
sensitivity<00:03:15.419> up<00:03:15.569> there<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.989> would<00:03:16.230> definitely

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
sensitivity up there I would definitely

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.379 
sensitivity up there I would definitely
check<00:03:16.919> out<00:03:17.069> control<00:03:17.489> freaks<00:03:17.940> now<00:03:18.180> I'm<00:03:18.239> not

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
check out control freaks now I'm not

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.240 
check out control freaks now I'm not
going<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.599> go<00:03:18.720> really<00:03:18.959> far<00:03:19.139> into<00:03:19.379> this<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.099> can

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
going to go really far into this you can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.890 
going to go really far into this you can
google<00:03:20.459> search<00:03:20.609> them<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.209> basically<00:03:21.599> their

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
google search them but basically their

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.449 
google search them but basically their
joystick<00:03:22.379> extenders<00:03:22.949> they<00:03:23.099> give<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> a

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
joystick extenders they give you a

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.009 
joystick extenders they give you a
little<00:03:23.669> bit<00:03:23.790> more<00:03:24.000> leverage<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.750> stick

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
little bit more leverage on the stick

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.830 
little bit more leverage on the stick
that's<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:25.799> she<00:03:25.949> said<00:03:26.159> but<00:03:26.280> uh<00:03:26.340> anyways<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's what she said but uh anyways it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020 
that's what she said but uh anyways it
allows<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.229> to<00:03:28.319> kind<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.650> aim<00:03:29.010> more<00:03:29.489> precisely

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
allows you to kind of aim more precisely

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.729 
allows you to kind of aim more precisely
at<00:03:30.359> those<00:03:30.510> higher<00:03:30.720> sensitivity<00:03:31.109> so<00:03:31.560> it'll

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
at those higher sensitivity so it'll

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.050 
at those higher sensitivity so it'll
allow<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.159> kind<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.549> bump<00:03:32.760> up<00:03:32.909> your

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
allow you to kind of bump up your

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.300 
allow you to kind of bump up your
sensitivity<00:03:33.629> probably<00:03:33.959> one<00:03:34.169> or<00:03:34.199> two<00:03:34.349> slots<00:03:34.919> so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
sensitivity probably one or two slots so

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.210 
sensitivity probably one or two slots so
anyways<00:03:36.180> guys<00:03:36.329> again<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.260> don't<00:03:37.680> base<00:03:37.889> stuff

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
anyways guys again just don't base stuff

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.619 
anyways guys again just don't base stuff
off<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.489> what<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:38.849> do<00:03:39.000> or<00:03:39.329> any<00:03:39.479> other

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
off of what I do or any other

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.569 
off of what I do or any other
commentator<00:03:40.229> does<00:03:40.500> kind<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.099> do<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.370> for

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
commentator does kind of do it for

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.159 
commentator does kind of do it for
yourself<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> try<00:03:42.780> out<00:03:42.930> all<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
yourself and try out all the

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.689 
yourself and try out all the
sensitivities<00:03:43.799> find<00:03:44.069> out<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.370> works<00:03:44.549> for

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
sensitivities find out what works for

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.119 
sensitivities find out what works for
you<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.209> then<00:03:46.019> go<00:03:46.199> ahead<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.379> rock<00:03:46.620> out<00:03:46.889> with

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
you and then go ahead and rock out with

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.809 
you and then go ahead and rock out with
your<00:03:47.250> gout<00:03:47.729> so<00:03:48.090> anyways<00:03:49.079> guys<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:50.370> will<00:03:50.790> catch
