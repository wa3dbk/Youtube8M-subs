00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.930
 and then people are here with my crf 230 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 and I'm making this video for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 show you how it was 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.940
 developed an automatic lubricator 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 current means pain was made clear 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 so that we can keep the current 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.900
 and full of oil during track by 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 cause of water sand sludge which is a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 of the things that most deteriorate the kit 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 during the sato track then it is as follows 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 I'm going to come here in front of the bike that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.079
 was show you'll lower the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.350
 fairing that I've already let go and I'm going 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 show here a reservoir that swims 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 more than an oil reservoir of the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 beetle 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 I installed it here with a tape of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 metal or rather an aluminum band and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 this aluminum strap 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 I picked up a company that works with 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 box to the bathroom was not there to ask for a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.899
 They gave me this piece here. 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.519
 I did the bending of him I made a hole and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.130
 I took the screw that secures the bracket 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.260
 of the throttle cables 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.350
 I took advantage of this hole I put the same 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.900
 original bolt and I fixed it here 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.970
 the lubricator reservoir 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 you can see below the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
 searcher I put a masterpiece of the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 of the reservoir I put a clamp 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 and the hose leaves here leaves a small 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.220
 because of the curve of the handlebar to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.710
 do not stretch and do not blow the hose 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.540
 and being here from the side you will see 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.380
 I also took the path that the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.840
 Throttle cable does the same thing 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.939
 I made the button that will trigger the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.799
 automatic lubricator because what the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 button I put it here 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.670
 this is a very simple button to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.869
 who has not located here was O 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.880
 fixed on top of the clutch and it is high 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.290
 deviation was purchased on an auto parts 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 Any other request to you will go 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.990
 find it from here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 the button when you press fires release 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.319
 Fuel removed his finger for 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.629
 lubricate and does not continue leaking oil 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.459
 different from other lubricators that 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.560
 are made with valves you have to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.579
 regulate to know how much 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.310
 Not out here 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.980
 squeezed website took out of it does not come out 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.719
 automatic fully automatic 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.189
 then it works as follows 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.260
 be a hose around here you go 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.900
 pass the hose under the tank 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.859
 When I installed, I did not have to take 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.739
 the tank 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.459
 I took the seat of the motorcycle only you go 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.189
 see there was already loose the seat of the bike and 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.859
 you will see that it is basically a give 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.019
 You can barely identify where the 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.180
 adaptation I made but I 'll explain 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.799
 for you guys 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 below the tek you will notice that the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.079
 hose going on underneath beneath 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.269
 of the frame so as not to crush the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.879
 time that you fit the bank and you 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.989
 will connect the hose that arrived here 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.060
 points to it not an injection pump of 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.919
 fuel can be any 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.079
 any vehicle that is a bomb that goes 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.959
 in the fuel tank which is 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.509
 there on the side of the right car engine 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.280
 fuel pump has an inlet and 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:24.290
 way down here 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.030
 in this place here is done the installation 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.840
 put your arms up and you can see that I 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.120
 I put it on the motorcycle air filter 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.430
 do not disturb the air intake here is 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.500
 freedom and stayed here in the corner without 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.560
 to mess up does not disturb the bank 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.650
 You do not need to remember anything, just two 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.720
 Plastic clamps for you to leave 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.340
 from here not to beat the bassaki 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.829
 observe the following a hose came out 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.030
 she will walk along with the installation 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:00.150
 electric motorcycle of the bottom goes down 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.400
 here and will come here O 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.509
 Do you want me to have you here? I have a hero. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 responsible for blocking the exit of 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.879
 oil when it is not abandoned 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.019
 I pressed the button that I showed you 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:19.049
 up there the solemnity opens and the bomb in 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.389
 General where I took my finger on the sony button 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.330
 norde closes and the eye does not continue 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.410
 descending if you do not have a solenoid 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.270
 does not hold oil 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.950
 leaking right away because she does not have that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 lock so I put the 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.380
 solemnity the hose will come out and go 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.960
 down with the bike frame 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.690
 here without having to cut anything when 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.870
 I'll show you and it will come down from behind. 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.570
 here of the painting and you will notice that 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.180
 She goes down and returns a little. 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.460
 I straight through here two clamps 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.010
 are attached to these clamps. 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.660
 holding the hose you left behind 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.640
 the back here I want to show for 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.660
 Calmly let's see if it will 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.490
 low at the end of the hose back there 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.670
 I hope you can see the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.060
 camera is not the best phone already 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.610
 saw personal well amateur business but 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.490
 very capricious 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.580
 every system that can pay attention to 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.030
 which has a red wire here the wire binds 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.790
 The solemnity also connects the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.320
 injection I made with all the terminals is 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.660
 I have purchased the terminals and 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.550
 installation on the negative wire ends 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.610
 positive is hidden here below 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.410
 You're not even going to see it here. 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.810
 Okay, but it's just the wire 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.090
 in the corner here and neat to dinho 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.400
 have no problem with water or stop 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.590
 to run or burst or suddenly 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.590
 close a short has been installed 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.960
 The way you can see nothing was 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.090
 trimmed all just fit you guys 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.530
 can see that sony norde has even been 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.140
 docked here 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.380
 on the side of the battery in an empty 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.240
 the motorcycle itself already has nothing 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.410
 This problem, I do not need anything. 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.450
 cut off the bench on both sides and 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.940
 adapts according to what 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.169
 You 're sure to see here. 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.850
 the system works perfectly 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.430
 including you will not have more trouble 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.310
 dry after last competitor 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.330
 water or walking in places that have 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.950
 a lot of mud 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.660
 we know that there are currents and that 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.810
 starts making a loud noise 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.040
 As you can see the current is fine. 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.750
 lubricated dinho 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.740
 after I wash the bike simply 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.750
 I put the finger on the button and it lubricates 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.880
 again 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.220
 And it's no problem, the bike too. 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.570
 brand new was used a few times I 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.510
 I believe that making a device 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.400
 From here you'll be able to keep your 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.160
 relationship kit 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.290
 lasting much longer and will be able to 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.780
 walk much more without bothering 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.130
 Okay, that's it people I hope to have 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.430
 helped you 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.230
 hopefully you will get those 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.630
 elaborated the way I explained it to 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.620
 You any doubt just ask 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.620
 Thanks guys!
