it's playing you can scan three

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's playing you can scan three
responses<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.559> decide<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> controls<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.269> can

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
responses I decide the controls you can

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.140 
responses I decide the controls you can
shut<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> pan<00:00:40.339> it'll<00:00:41.339> continue<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> play<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the outside you can also multitask so I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.020 
the outside you can also multitask so I
could<00:00:50.670> go<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.550> wash<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> web

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
playing so it is a little bit of

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.210 
playing so it is a little bit of
multitasking<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.290> here's<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.649> mobile

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
multitasking so here's the mobile

00:01:48.220 --> 00:02:00.630

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.630 

so<00:02:01.180> it's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.480> full<00:02:01.690> HTML<00:02:01.840> browser<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.610> I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so it's a full HTML browser that I

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.520 
so it's a full HTML browser that I
always<00:02:03.790> say<00:02:04.000> defaults<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.990> know<00:02:05.110> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
mobile version because more websites are

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.419 
mobile version because more websites are
getting<00:02:07.360> smarter<00:02:07.810> about<00:02:07.930> detecting<00:02:08.649> you're

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429
