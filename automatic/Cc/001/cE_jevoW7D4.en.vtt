people<00:04:57.310> playing<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.729> don't<00:04:57.939> know<00:04:58.029> so<00:04:59.849> it<00:05:00.849> would

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
people playing I don't know so it would

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.540 
people playing I don't know so it would
be<00:05:01.120> awesome<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:01.539> they<00:05:01.689> would<00:05:01.810> add<00:05:01.930> guns<00:05:02.550> it

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.670 
be bringing back a wall type game mode
they're<00:05:10.689> gonna<00:05:10.779> be<00:05:10.900> changing<00:05:11.139> it<00:05:11.349> up<00:05:11.409> a<00:05:11.529> little

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
they're gonna be changing it up a little

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.260 
they're gonna be changing it up a little
bit<00:05:11.860> making<00:05:12.099> it<00:05:12.279> a<00:05:12.340> little<00:05:12.490> bit<00:05:12.639> more<00:05:12.849> exciting

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
bit making it a little bit more exciting

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.240 
bit making it a little bit more exciting
a<00:05:13.389> little<00:05:13.629> bit<00:05:13.750> more<00:05:14.020> new<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.490> that's<00:05:15.669> good<00:05:15.909> i

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
a little bit more new so that's good i

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.159 
a little bit more new so that's good i
guess<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.729> also<00:05:19.089> depends<00:05:19.389> on<00:05:19.539> how<00:05:19.719> much<00:05:19.870> space

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
guess it also depends on how much space

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.029 
guess it also depends on how much space
they<00:05:20.409> have<00:05:20.560> left<00:05:21.089> with<00:05:22.089> i<00:05:22.710> rememba<00:05:23.710> land<00:05:23.889> water

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
they have left with i rememba land water

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.369 
they have left with i rememba land water
wall<00:05:24.339> i<00:05:24.370> think<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.729> was<00:05:24.819> like<00:05:24.879> 16<00:05:25.389> maps<00:05:25.659> and

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
wall i think it was like 16 maps and

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.309 
wall i think it was like 16 maps and
they<00:05:27.069> had<00:05:27.249> a<00:05:27.279> lot<00:05:27.610> more<00:05:27.849> maps<00:05:28.089> after<00:05:28.810> world<00:05:28.990> so

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
they had a lot more maps after world so

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.189 
they had a lot more maps after world so
if<00:05:29.919> you<00:05:30.249> don't<00:05:30.430> know<00:05:30.639> who<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.719> should<00:05:31.750> know

if you don't know who you should know

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.429 
if you don't know who you should know

than a DVD to xbox users so they have to

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.540 
than a DVD to xbox users so they have to
basically<00:05:40.270> limit<00:05:40.930> down<00:05:41.110> how<00:05:41.650> much<00:05:41.800> TLC<00:05:42.099> to<00:05:42.520> a

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
basically limit down how much TLC to a

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 
it and then they fix it up before it

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.399 
it and then they fix it up before it
gets<00:05:55.870> released<00:05:56.319> so<00:05:56.770> right<00:05:57.009> now<00:05:57.210> you<00:05:58.210> have<00:05:58.479> the
