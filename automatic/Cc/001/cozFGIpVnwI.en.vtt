 Hello everybody, I'm here today to give you a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 tip is very cool especially for 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.010

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.230
 to paint the nails with a special enamel 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.120
 I'll teach you how to paint it. 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 and without having to clean them 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 subsequently as acetone or with some 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 nail polish remover 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.949
 Anything you're going to need is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
