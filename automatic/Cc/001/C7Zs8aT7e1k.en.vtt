 to complete the work with enough 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.590
 install on that computer 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.050
 pre yourself who contrary to his 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.510
 set and what next you actually with 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.360
 this computer set order resin 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.010
 and it works online plus beyond that 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.840
 understand it is not natural you can go 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.150
 not only from this computer home 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.549
 come then you have a laptop you have 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.710
 two children they want to sit what thread 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.229
 On the site of contact, look, see 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.250
 need and something else wants the same thing on 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.440
 this computer you can not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.510
 permanent tortured this is this table 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.130
 quite problematic here look 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.460
 guys are joking aside which 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.450
 advantage of saying yes here first 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.229
 queue so what 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.300
 Arsenu was interested here separately 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.490
 Of course mobile that is clear that 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.930
 many brokers they create their 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.199
 special there versions for androids for 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.389
 be ipads pulling 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.340
 trading terminal a for modern 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.150
 trader yes so can you say to someone 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.250
 such a trader 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.100
 but 1 trading terminal is obviously not enough 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.960
 need some kind of evaluator some kind of robotic 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.530
 and run me to stop further 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.410
 receiving glowing Well launch 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.600
 usually ordinary in goal second with legs and 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.720
 parallel to it 4 q5 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.370
 but very cool but it's obvious that up to that 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.650
 these are all five centuries but we will not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.840
 redo for yes and change where broker 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.060
 granddaughter this broker wrote you super 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:30.030
 to trade them for the right worked for 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.410
 android from 3000 rubles so here 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.539
 here of course the remote computer 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.590
 much more convenient that we once opened 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.419
 tablet and see all all what followed 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.220
 run all finish off running all 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.220
 programs that is we carpets
