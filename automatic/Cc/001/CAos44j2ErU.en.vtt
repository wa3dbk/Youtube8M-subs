00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.319
 more than an hour later 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.759
 I really am 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.190
 hell so hard 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.190
 thereby I think this will be but I think 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 ahoy 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.830
 only one property on the council 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.720
 September is still with us 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.630
 I hope you for everyone but this is not easy 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.440
 just like last year 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.600
 but it is me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.340
 somewhat lower 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.339
 i see here 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.339
 but a year later 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 it said 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 they do this in consideration 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.770
 you can't help it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.130

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 luke donald 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.280
 that's how life dragged on 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 I thought she was the sentiment 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 Sorry 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.899

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.799

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.799
 from yellow to 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.259
 here is on the eve 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.579
 to sit still is to lose lately 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.839
 the undertone 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.040

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.299
 Greece 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.009
 I continue like this 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.139
