I'd<00:03:46.080> be<00:03:46.260> overkill<00:03:46.650> maybe<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.130> Sam<00:03:47.370> gets<00:03:47.610> more

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
I'd be overkill maybe if Sam gets more

I'd be overkill maybe if Sam gets more
to<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.660> story<00:03:48.870> we'll<00:03:49.200> we'll<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.530> to

to the story we'll we'll have to

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.160 
to the story we'll we'll have to
represent<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.460> 20-4<00:03:51.000> info<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.420> think<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.930> think

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
represent a 20-4 info I think I think

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.960 
represent a 20-4 info I think I think
some<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.350> what<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.710> is<00:03:52.920> about<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.490> think<00:03:53.670> so

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
some of what this is about I think so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.200 
some of what this is about I think so
too

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
too

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.000 
too
because<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.660> think<00:03:54.870> somebody<00:03:55.230> had<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> rat<00:03:55.800> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
because I think somebody had a rat I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.290 
because I think somebody had a rat I
don't<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.310> think<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.610> odds<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.060> he's<00:03:57.180> gonna

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
don't I think the odds that he's gonna

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.600 
don't I think the odds that he's gonna
walk<00:03:57.630> by<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.650> Danny<00:03:58.860> roll<00:03:59.190> his<00:03:59.400> eye

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
walk by and see Danny roll his eye

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
walk by and see Danny roll his eye
that's<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.240> sounds<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.600> bullshit<00:04:00.990> mom
