00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.029 
that's who coached Jackson is that's a
system<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.899> you<00:01:41.289> know<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.530> knew<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:41.800> coming

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
system and you know we knew that coming

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.979 
system and you know we knew that coming
in<00:01:42.250> but<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.849> would<00:01:43.030> certainly<00:01:43.179> prepare<00:01:43.750> for

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
in but we would certainly prepare for

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.779 
in but we would certainly prepare for
everything<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.649> they<00:01:44.979> threw<00:01:45.220> at<00:01:45.399> us<00:01:45.429> you

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
everything that they threw at us you

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.609 
everything that they threw at us you
know<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:45.940> think<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.569> most<00:01:47.020> has<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.380> got<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
know I think I most has just got the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.949 
know I think I most has just got the
best<00:01:47.800> of<00:01:48.009> us<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:49.000> really<00:01:49.119> seemed<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.390> CJ

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
best of us and it really seemed like CJ

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.109 
best of us and it really seemed like CJ

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
did finally end up with 13 points but

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.089 
did finally end up with 13 points but
he's<00:01:55.420> someone<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.050> got<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.289> have<00:01:56.560> in

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
he's someone that you got to have in

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.279 
he's someone that you got to have in
double<00:01:57.580> figures<00:01:57.910> in<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.599> ballgame<00:01:58.899> he's<00:01:59.259> got

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
to carry the team as far as the offense

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.070 
to carry the team as far as the offense
and<00:02:01.209> it<00:02:01.270> seemed<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:01.450> he<00:02:01.660> was<00:02:01.720> able<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.929> do

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080
