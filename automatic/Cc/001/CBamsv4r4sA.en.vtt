is to get there so many rounds on easy
250<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.880> medium<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.930> believe<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.230> have<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.410> get

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
250 on medium I believe you have to get

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.460 
250 on medium I believe you have to get
to<00:04:07.680> 75<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:09.209> think<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.840> I'm<00:04:09.930> hard<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.319> have<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
to 75 I think and I'm hard you have to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.400 
to 75 I think and I'm hard you have to
get<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:11.190> 85<00:04:11.670> i<00:04:11.700> think<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.690> each<00:04:12.989> round<00:04:13.170> gets

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
get like 85 i think in each round gets

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.930 
get like 85 i think in each round gets
considerably<00:04:13.709> harder<00:04:14.130> as<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.389> go<00:04:15.690> through

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
considerably harder as you go through
