00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
but I also found it very very

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.620 
but I also found it very very
challenging<00:01:30.410> in<00:01:31.280> part<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.510> my

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.370 
he was able to get but this far at this
point<00:05:12.520> he<00:05:13.240> completely<00:05:13.720> scrapped<00:05:14.020> what<00:05:14.170> he<00:05:14.260> was

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
point he completely scrapped what he was

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.650 
point he completely scrapped what he was
doing<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.920> he<00:05:14.980> developed<00:05:15.730> a<00:05:15.820> brand<00:05:16.060> new<00:05:16.270> model

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
doing and he developed a brand new model

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.450 
doing and he developed a brand new model
and<00:05:16.840> that<00:05:16.900> model<00:05:17.560> gave<00:05:18.130> him<00:05:18.280> this<00:05:18.490> data<00:05:18.700> set

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
and that model gave him this data set

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.680 
and that model gave him this data set
he's<00:05:21.460> since<00:05:21.670> gone<00:05:21.850> on<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.090> publish<00:05:22.570> his

he's since gone on to publish his

actually work but in all of
there's<00:06:45.039> one<00:06:45.249> really<00:06:46.089> really<00:06:46.300> important

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
there's one really really important

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.129 
there's one really really important
activity<00:06:47.409> and<00:06:47.649> that's<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:48.069> understand<00:06:49.139> this

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
activity and that's to understand this

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.499 
activity and that's to understand this
is<00:06:50.319> about<00:06:50.589> gaining<00:06:51.129> an<00:06:51.429> understanding<00:06:51.580> of<00:06:52.360> a

is about gaining an understanding of a

user's needs and of their challenges
with<00:06:54.879> data<00:06:55.089> and<00:06:55.389> then<00:06:55.959> being<00:06:56.169> able<00:06:56.259> to

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439 
with data and then being able to

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.589 
with data and then being able to
translate<00:06:56.979> that<00:06:57.129> into<00:06:57.729> a<00:06:58.119> set<00:06:58.449> of

visualization design requirements

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.419 
visualization design requirements
I<00:07:00.989> find<00:07:01.989> this<00:07:02.199> step<00:07:02.469> to<00:07:02.739> be<00:07:02.889> the<00:07:03.219> most

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:03.429 
I find this step to be the most

00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:05.309 
I find this step to be the most
challenging<00:07:03.639> but<00:07:04.330> it<00:07:04.539> is<00:07:04.659> also<00:07:04.929> definitely

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
challenging but it is also definitely

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.729 
challenging but it is also definitely
the<00:07:05.679> most<00:07:05.800> fun<00:07:06.929> to<00:07:07.929> get<00:07:08.050> my<00:07:08.139> understanding<00:07:08.679> is

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:08.739 
the most fun to get my understanding is

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:10.769 
the most fun to get my understanding is
correct<00:07:08.800> I<00:07:09.429> work<00:07:09.759> really<00:07:09.999> hard<00:07:10.119> to<00:07:10.449> get<00:07:10.629> into
