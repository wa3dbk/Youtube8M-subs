touch<00:00:26.180> now<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.449> material<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.140> ultra<00:00:28.650> matte

touch now this material is ultra matte

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.710 
touch now this material is ultra matte
as<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.130> mentioned<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> reason<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.359> ultra

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
as I mentioned and the reason it's ultra

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.910 
as I mentioned and the reason it's ultra
matte<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
matte is because of the way that it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.850 
matte is because of the way that it's
finished<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:33.239> unsealed<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.590> like

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
finished it's actually unsealed so like

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
finished it's actually unsealed so like
suede<00:00:35.190> you'll<00:00:35.520> definitely<00:00:36.000> need<00:00:36.090> to
