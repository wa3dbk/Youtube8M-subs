I've worn it wavy for about a week now
and<00:00:33.330> what<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.770> people

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and what I'm going to do is people

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
and what I'm going to do is people
always<00:00:35.550> ask<00:00:35.730> me<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.390> straighten

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
always ask me how do they straighten

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.410 
always ask me how do they straighten
their<00:00:36.989> hair<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> diverge<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.519> here<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.360> i

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
their hair can you diverge in here and i

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.119 
their hair can you diverge in here and i
always<00:00:39.449> say<00:00:39.780> yes<00:00:40.080> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> diverge<00:00:40.769> in<00:00:40.890> here

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
always say yes you can diverge in here

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
always say yes you can diverge in here
so<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.269> example<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.400> a<00:00:44.600> dying<00:00:45.600> I've

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so this is the example of a dying I've

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.950 
so this is the example of a dying I've
done<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.000> hair<00:00:48.000> takes<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.510> well<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.080> die<00:00:49.470> in

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
done a hair takes really well to die in

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.640 
done a hair takes really well to die in
everything<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:53.180> that's<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.540> thing<00:00:54.900> so

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
everything so that's the way thing so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.280 
everything so that's the way thing so
I'm<00:00:55.830> gonna<00:00:56.040> do<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:56.549> anyways<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.989> gonna

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
I'm gonna do now anyways I'm gonna

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.930 
I'm gonna do now anyways I'm gonna
straighten<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.400> and<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.549> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> come<00:00:59.909> back

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and show you guys what it looks like I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.859 
and show you guys what it looks like I
find<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> easier<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:03.000> straighten<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.750> when

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
find it easier to straighten from when

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.080 
find it easier to straighten from when
the<00:01:03.960> hair<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.140> wet<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.880> wet

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the hair is wet so what I do is I wet

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
the hair is wet so what I do is I wet
the<00:01:06.119> hair<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.690> goes<00:01:06.840> back<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> its<00:01:07.229> normal<00:01:07.470> wave

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the hair it goes back to its normal wave

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.640 
the hair it goes back to its normal wave
pattern<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.479> i<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.470> blow-dryer

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
pattern and then i use my blow-dryer

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
pattern and then i use my blow-dryer
straightening<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.790> way<00:01:12.000> using<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> blow

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
straightening out that way using a blow

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
straightening out that way using a blow
dryer<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.159> hair

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
dryer and then I just use my hair

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.639 
dryer and then I just use my hair
straighteners<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.600> I'll<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.289> back<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.560> one

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
straighteners so I'll be back in one

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.639 
straighteners so I'll be back in one

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
I've just quickly run down I've put

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.340 
I've just quickly run down I've put
water<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.200> gone

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
water on it and as you can see it's gone

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.770 
water on it and as you can see it's gone
back<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.859> kids<00:01:26.299> natural<00:01:27.299> wave<00:01:28.070> pattern<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
back to my kids natural wave pattern I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.459 
back to my kids natural wave pattern I
normally<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.109> little<00:01:31.350> water

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
normally have like a little water

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.289 
normally have like a little water
canister<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.219> I<00:01:32.280> find<00:01:32.579> when<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> comes<00:01:33.210> to

morning<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> wake<00:01:39.179> up<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:39.810> water

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
morning when I wake up my little water

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.529 
morning when I wake up my little water
canister<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:40.859> with<00:01:41.460> water<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:41.999> I<00:01:42.329> just

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
canister and with water in it and I just

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.239 
canister and with water in it and I just
split<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> pure<00:01:43.320> water<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> mix<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> with

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
split a pure water as I mix it with

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.039 
split a pure water as I mix it with
anything<00:01:44.609> just<00:01:45.210> spray<00:01:45.359> it<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.570> hair<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.170 

it<00:03:43.300> will<00:03:43.480> cut<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.590> strength<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.370> keep<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:45.760> on

is<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> end

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:28.969 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.340
