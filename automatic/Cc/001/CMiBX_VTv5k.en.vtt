00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
thought well you know this is something

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.240 
thought well you know this is something
I<00:03:06.870> could<00:03:06.930> stick<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.650> tried<00:03:07.830> again<00:03:07.980> for

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
I could stick with so I tried again for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.520 
I could stick with so I tried again for
a<00:03:08.310> second<00:03:08.610> time<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.000> felt<00:03:09.360> even<00:03:09.660> harder<00:03:09.990> but

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
a second time it felt even harder but

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.230 
a second time it felt even harder but
then<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.800> third<00:03:11.010> time<00:03:11.250> came<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.030> wasn't

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
then the third time came and it wasn't

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.130 
then the third time came and it wasn't
so<00:03:12.540> bad

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
so bad

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.260 
so bad
now<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> previous<00:03:14.790> thought<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> had

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
now with the previous thought that I had

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.420 
now with the previous thought that I had
done<00:03:15.390> before<00:03:15.540> where<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> went<00:03:16.320> down<00:03:16.470> from<00:03:16.620> 210

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
done before where I went down from 210

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.270 
done before where I went down from 210
down<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.790> 170<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.750> had<00:03:18.900> done<00:03:19.080> fasts<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.769> but

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
down to 170 I had done fasts there but

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.160 
down to 170 I had done fasts there but
their<00:03:20.400> fasting<00:03:20.790> was<00:03:20.940> different<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.570> could<00:03:22.080> only

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
their fasting was different I could only

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.240 
their fasting was different I could only
have<00:03:22.380> meat

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
have meat

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.300 
have meat
sorry<00:03:23.730> excuse<00:03:24.060> me<00:03:24.090> proteins<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.780> vegetables

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
sorry excuse me proteins and vegetables

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.060 
sorry excuse me proteins and vegetables
with<00:03:26.310> intermittent<00:03:26.970> fasting<00:03:27.709> it's<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.920> much

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
with intermittent fasting it's so much

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.740 
with intermittent fasting it's so much
easier<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.790> sense<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:30.090> when<00:03:30.630> you're

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
easier in the sense that when you're

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.210 
easier in the sense that when you're
only<00:03:30.840> having<00:03:31.230> meat<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.680> vegetables<00:03:32.130> and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
only having meat and vegetables and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.970 
only having meat and vegetables and
other<00:03:32.340> fasts<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:34.080> stresses<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.650> because

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
other fasts it stresses you out because

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
other fasts it stresses you out because
you<00:03:35.220> want<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.850> little<00:03:36.209> bit<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.360> food<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
you want that little bit of food that

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.650

you<00:03:36.810> can<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.920> taste<00:03:38.100> good<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:39.540> be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
you can have to taste good and to be

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.210 
you can have to taste good and to be
honest<00:03:39.959> I'd<00:03:40.110> rather<00:03:40.290> eat<00:03:40.380> nothing<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.070> try
