00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.230
 differences and this video is about the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.030
 first idea until in the next 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.730

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.860

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.780

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.930
 today's special today I bring you 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.350
 a pizza in the shape of a heart this pizza 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.630
 it's the easiest thing to do and the richest 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.030
 it's not for nothing but I stay delicious 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.470
 so I hope you like it a lot 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.470
 video and let's start 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.120
 The first thing we are going to do is that 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190
 let's mix two teaspoons of 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.350
 Active dry yeast is found 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.290
 in any supermarket remember that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.010
 are many of these types those of coffee and 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 then two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.990
 to this we will add a cup of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.720
 water and we're going to mix it very well 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 the water should be warmer or more 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.090
 less about 30 to 40 seconds in the micro 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.979
 and we 're going to leave it for 10 minutes and then 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.280
 of the 10 minutes we have to stay 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.320
 something like that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.830
 then we add half a teaspoon 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.950
 of salt and a tablespoon of oil 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.500
 then we are going to add 3 cups of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.750
 please or flour to make bread and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 We are going to add rate for the added 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.390
 the first cup and we mix it very very 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.390
 all right 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.080
 then we add the second cup 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.080
 we keep mixing 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.820
 ah 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.629
 the third one we are going to add 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.939
 little bit because it's going to get a little 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:21.799
 point that the dough is put on a 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:21.799
 little rebel a little bit 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.450
 then let's play with the mass and what 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.450
 we will see as pellets or circulito 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.800
 since it is very round our 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.450
 small ball 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 we are going to put in a saucepan part 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.760
 little bit of olive oil and we're going to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.190
 put there and we 're going to cover it and we're going 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.990
 to leave an hour for the dough to rest 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.920
 after an hour there will be something like that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.720
 it looks great today is not left alone 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.080
 suavecita and in plan and is super father 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.690
 and I'm going to take half because with this 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.070
 mass we can make two pizzas and what 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.270
 first thing you're going to do is like for me 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.390
 flour on my table and I will expand my 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.850
 mass crushes it very well we are going to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.560
 also use a roller some 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.190
 those who use as for the chairs 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.190
 and we're going 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.810
 do not 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.830
 Y 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.170
 then let's stretch the dough 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.880
 I say if you want to believe pizza 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.060
 winnow and here we throw we are going to put 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.210
 a little oil in our face not me 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.290
 go and put your pizza and what you 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.290
 that we are going to stretch the dough 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.599
 in the round pan and then I'm going to 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.569
 grab this paper or what you guys 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.930
 have at hand and we are going to cut with 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.270
 Scissors a heart the truth to me 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.090
 my heart was not so good but 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.959
 you then cut a heart or 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.520
 print a heart as you can 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.260
 we live a heart and what we are going to 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.290
 to do is that we are going to put the paper 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.859
 above the mass this paper is like 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.030
 that I used to cover the dough 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.190
 special for 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.050
 the kitchen then this paper hit him on 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.930
 the mass and what I'm going to do is that I'm going 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.030
 to start cutting with some to cut 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.060
 the track of that your redonditos I'm going to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.190
 start cutting and doing that way of 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.900
 heart for this piece is not this the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.940
 heart mold if they are fixed is super 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.160
 easy no more although they have like that 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.350
 something in the form of a heart and cut it and 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.340
 ready 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.710
 then I will start 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.690
 to shape my heart and I'm going to do 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.470
 like on the banks I'm going to close 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.270
 set 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.170
 so that you do not get that sauce out of how 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.170
 that we are going to add it 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.679
 then we are going to add so much tomato 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.379
 you can add your favorite the 

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:11.469
 that you like and something that is super 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.049
 easy because no more is to add the link 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:17.110
 tomato later we add cheese 

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:20.019
 mozarella and in the end we achieved the 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.839
 peppers anise and that's how simple it is if 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:25.269
 they fix the only laborious thing was the apple 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.459
 I 'm going to add some pepperoni 

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:31.449
 it's heart shaped here like this 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:34.320
 mold he cited small to cut them and he 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.840
 he added them for all the pizza 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.870
 obviously this solve because if not 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.570
 you have it lawful for your person what can you 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.160
 add the subsequent riots and I 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.260
 I wanted them to have more hearts 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.320
 sterilize then we're going to put it in 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.080
 oven about 12 between 12 and 15 minutes 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.390
 depending on how you want it and then 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.860
 they have to look something like that just see 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.340
 which process lasts the truth is not for 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.590
 nothing but it was very rich I hope 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.420
