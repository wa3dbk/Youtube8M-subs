00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello is to say that and today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
 I will introduce you to a new toy 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.269
 from mega bloks who alas high in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 howl of death so this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.449
 game box is still the most 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 consistent with them as it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.890
 contains 809 crate and to give you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.980
 an idea I put about two hours 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 for everything seemed so I start to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 aix which is simpler ie the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 three characters that come with 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.239
 the box you have the human warrior 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 who is the king marianne 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.329
 here you have then the priest elves 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.329
 of the night 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.050
 and finally the third which is the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.210
 death knight binomial nothing 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.629
 special to say regarding these three 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.489
 figurines they are delivered mounted and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 you can then if you wish 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 the disarticulated change their armor if 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.960
 you have in the secret pockets of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 parts about them you have 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 also a catapult 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.869
 I show it to you quickly because 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 good catapult set is not good 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.479
 no more 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.770
 on the other hand the piece of which I very 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 want to talk to you it's wing of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.110
 death 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 I think it's really a room 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.540
 which was particularly successful I 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.840
 a real crush on the wings that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.259
 are in my opinion really very very pretty 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.990
 the color is very beautiful and the effects 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.390
 who are put are really successful 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.100
 also it gives a nice look to the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 piece especially since she is very 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 detailed here as well on the top 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.220
 only on the underside 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.619
 they also made a piece that is 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.270
 very mobile since the tail of the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.920
 dragon is articulated the paws 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.630
 here at the front and back also 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 so you can really put it in 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.860
 the position that interest you the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.670
 wings obviously you can them 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 deploy as you see fit and even 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.830
 the head here is articulated as well as the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.500
 mouth of the dragon 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.480
 here I rotate it so that you 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 have the most complete view possible 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 maybe just a little bit of attention 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.170
 when you start editing with the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.239
 pieces because for example here you in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.160
 have with little hooks you do not 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.380
 will not see very well but this one by 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.920
 example to a small hook but the one 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.980
 which is right next there is none so 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.300
 sort your pieces well to avoid 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.410
 assembly assembly because that's it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.480
 quickly becomes that at that foot then 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.489
 you have in addition a small wing which 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 just put himself right there but very 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.530
 sincerely me they are all the time 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:10.260
 I show you the coin here and as 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.549
 she on all the time it's wrong so 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.570
 that's it then I'll follow the advice of a 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.519
 visitors who asked me to use 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.329
 has given in particular to give you a 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.329
 idea of ​​dimensions 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:35.519
 So here is the size of the CDs 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 and the scope of death del I hope 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.380
 that gives us a better idea 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.579
 roughly speaking I would say that delon wing of 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.250
 death is about 40 cm for a 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.280
 wingspan with spread wings of 35 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.600
 cm and about 25 times that the wings are 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.670
 closed I give you information 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.320
 this is especially for storage 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.450
 because it's true that these are 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.620
 pieces that take up space and we 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.069
 do not always know where the masters a 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.060
 once they are mounted then in this 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.760
 that involves biting but I have more 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.330
 great thing to say to you and I want 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 now you speak place it sell it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.640
 so for levante also it's also a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.500
 very beautiful piece but it presents 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.909
 according to me still less interest 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.430
 during editing because these are 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.159
 really blocks to assemble what 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.150
 I found it particularly successful 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:37.349
 are the statuses here is so they are 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 a piece they are molded and I have to 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.729
 say that once we place them on the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.140
 pedestals it really gives a lot 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.580
 of love to screaming on but here I am 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.180
 I'll show you the play 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:58.140
 closer so you have a beautiful 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.810
 view also so she is pretty stable 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.560
 the city see I can handle it without 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.849
 that it does not feel that it falls that it is 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.010
 also a nice surprise 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.710
 then do hurlevent was 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.450
 represented before or after the tacc 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.270
 of death wing with thursday for not knowing 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.890
 too much since the towers are not 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.289
 really damaged but at the same time 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.539
 are greyed out so which means when 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.060
 even that they may have taken a 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.130
 little flash of flame since originally 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.349
 they are full gray you will notice 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.240
 also at the level of the aisle she is 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.700
 not completely represent you have 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.700
 only three statuses and no 5 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.030
 here we find it's really I 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.780
 find that it is really a beautiful 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.120
 success 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.540
 and finally you have a little safe here 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.710
 to embellish everything with the little ones 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.380
 jewels that accompany him here I have 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.450
 nothing more to you says if this 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.100
 is leaving your comments because 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.540
 that I really like books and I 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.460
 find that sharing our experiences by 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.980
 compared to these parts it's very nice 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.980
 so see you soon goodbye
