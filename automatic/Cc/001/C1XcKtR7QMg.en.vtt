00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 We look, I'll tell you. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.200
 my black photographic acts he just wants 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.360
 So what are you coming with me? 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.230
 mainly in instagram service but 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.029
 things like this are common 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.550
 mounts with 2 photos or 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 duplicate photos mostly I am 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 crazy of duplications even for a little 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 since it was much worse 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.550
 well here I created a patience of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 editors the crease you already know 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 I already told him about it here for you of several 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 times but it's the best option 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
 effects we will see this photo here by 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.329
 example was was with him is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.219
 it was originally so and I left more 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 or less so provide in style 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.670
 before 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 later pulled by brown yesterday and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 even super g3 venta black with white 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.170
 can is what I'm using the most is e 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.030
 sully from then to light 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 It's kind of like I do assemblies. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
 expected and come here in milan 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 And you choose your ones over there and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 here and there can not be that in the other 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.970
 How is it, mazinho, and to put this 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 blurred background in the case that is already 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 something that I have used extensively and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.080
 cilic are the effects of light 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.970
 there when you click on hot or 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.100
 90 degrees if you click on it it goes 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.650
 swapping you choose decorum that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.110
 even if you put your finger on the screen 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 you can change the effect tone more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 strong but marquinhos and if you press 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 in the evangelical setinhas 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.240
 for those who have a cell phone with low memory 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 this is a great tip that is download 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.670
 this attack called layout 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.570
 it is as if it were an extension of the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.789
 Instagram 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.500
 so when you download it it appears 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.720
 square here from the side 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.939
 if you press on it will appear several 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.450
 nice layouts for you 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.490
 here you can change is the position of the most 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 it will only give you an idea if you 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.140
 either two three five next to each other 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.630
 Look, it looks pretty good and that way. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.330
 This one here is very light and last 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.370
 I have is the hd camera studio and he 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.920
 simply add that the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.390
 hdr effect you will tighten these 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.049
 colored balls 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.140
 There are people hdr and then you will select the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.140
 type 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.670
 It's more for landscape food photos 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.460
 and that's the one if you thought you 'd like 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.150
 be a channel rover a video and even the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.150
 next video
