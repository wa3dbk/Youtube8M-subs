00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
easy unlike with the 5 and 70 now there

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.760 
easy unlike with the 5 and 70 now there
are<00:01:01.420> some<00:01:01.600> limitations<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.290> this<00:01:02.440> compact

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
are some limitations to this compact

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.340 
are some limitations to this compact
design<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.790> instance<00:01:04.180> as<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.479> LCD<00:01:05.019> is<00:01:05.110> top

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.440 
design for instance as the LCD is top
mounted<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.860> can't<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.399> from<00:01:06.490> below<00:01:06.759> so

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
mounted you can't see it from below so

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.760 
mounted you can't see it from below so
you<00:01:07.509> may<00:01:07.689> want<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.990> add<00:01:08.170> an<00:01:08.350> outboard

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
you may want to add an outboard

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.249 
you may want to add an outboard
electronic<00:01:09.460> viewfinder<00:01:09.969> or<00:01:10.119> EVF<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:11.110> make

this<00:01:11.380> more<00:01:11.560> versatile<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:13.030> may<00:01:13.150> want<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.420> add

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
this more versatile you may want to add

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.300 
this more versatile you may want to add
a<00:01:13.600> bar<00:01:13.840> mount<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.620> if<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.860> do<00:01:15.040> you're<00:01:15.250> gonna

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
a bar mount but if you do you're gonna

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310 
a bar mount but if you do you're gonna
need<00:01:15.520> quite<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.880> step<00:01:16.270> down<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.720> order<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.229> make

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
need quite a step down in order to make

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.690 
need quite a step down in order to make

places that may seem counterintuitive we
do<00:01:33.070> get<00:01:33.280> useless<00:01:33.990> now<00:01:34.990> let's<00:01:35.140> take<00:01:35.260> a<00:01:35.290> look<00:01:35.470> at

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
do get useless now let's take a look at

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.730 
do get useless now let's take a look at
the<00:01:35.619> front<00:01:35.860> end<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> f3<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.350> camera

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
the front end like the f3 this camera

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.800 
the front end like the f3 this camera
has<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.189> Sony<00:01:39.490> mount<00:01:39.790> this<00:01:40.060> time<00:01:40.330> it's<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.570> sony

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
has a Sony mount this time it's the sony

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.230 
has a Sony mount this time it's the sony
e-mount<00:01:41.049> now<00:01:42.010> email<00:01:42.430> lenses<00:01:42.790> are<00:01:42.909> not<00:01:43.090> the

e-mount now email lenses are not the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.700 
e-mount now email lenses are not the
best<00:01:43.450> quality<00:01:43.840> but<00:01:43.960> there<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.229> one<00:01:44.470> major

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
best quality but there is one major

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.950 
best quality but there is one major
advantage<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.909> having<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.420> mount<00:01:46.689> on<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
advantage to having this mount on the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.500 
advantage to having this mount on the
camera<00:01:47.290> now<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.280> email<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.909> quite<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.299> show

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
camera now the email is quite the show

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.510 
camera now the email is quite the show
amount<00:01:49.810> which<00:01:50.320> allows<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:50.860> add<00:01:51.130> mount

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
amount which allows you to add mount

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.060 
amount which allows you to add mount
adapters<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.119> top<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:52.600> we<00:01:53.530> carry<00:01:53.890> the
