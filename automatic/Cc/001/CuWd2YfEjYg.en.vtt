00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.910
 Hello, how are you? I'm Marcelo Zabala 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.240
 dragon ball eternal show and I'm going to 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 show them more or less 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.969
 the process that I do to encourage 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.289
 with the first program that we need 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.289
 what is the photoshop 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.580
 there is drawing 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.010
 I paint we are a program that you 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.350
 allows to work by layers 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.330
 I'm not very good at programs but I 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.740
 I used to photoshop because of the theme of 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.740
 the edition and it's signage 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 well there is the sketch sorry the 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.290
 Quick sack drawing the paint too 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.470
 it's only to explain a 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.470
 bit 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.280
 well we delineate 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.720
 we leave only the sketch in this case 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 no inking would be sketch 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 inking and painting 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.880
 we paint the son immediately 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 what more or less see 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.260
 let's put it also 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.260
 a shadow a shine 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.320
 remember in Christ is done to me not 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.320
 he only made a photoshop 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.150
 in shadow 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.860
 now more or less from lÃ©rida 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.630
 so remember the first program that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 I use to make the drawing more than anything 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.689
 is the photoshop and I keep it in format 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.689
 png 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.770
 the penny format opens 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.770
 when the windows of an image 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.470
 it would not be a little video we're going to 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.840
 finally live the second program that I use 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.550
 is the adobe flash 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.110
 that in fact people who use the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.209
 flash only without using photoshop 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.940
 but as the truth is not very good 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.489
 using programs you do not have to create as 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.180
 I always say my animal form 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.390
 the animal form itself using the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.670
 programs of more or less known 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.299
 photos about the one that best with which 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.299
 I get along better 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.670
 at the end remember in the second 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.030
 program that would be the stem save it in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.860
 mpg because because I keep it fast and not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.200
 loses so much quality 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.660
 good the program is the magic video of 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.020
 light that would be the final program of 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.020
 edition 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.230
 yes that would be the photoshop as a 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.459
 program to draw ink and paint 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.599
 the second would be the phrase side to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:34.000
 create the scene say with the PNG 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.360
 taken from the photoshop the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.730
 images to create the scene I keep the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.769
 scenes in a folder 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.470
 after I have all the folders 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.819
 the unit the whole chapter by pieces 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.819
 I open it with him 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.609
 imagine video deluxe to create the 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.219
 chapter decided to add some 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.139
 some lyrics the audio that is very 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.629
 important that I do not do it since I do not 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.240
 huaca is made in argentina buenos aires 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.069
 weak kingfisher is weak 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.849
 good 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.549
 he who arranges all the audio he knows 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.709
 the voices that will participate in the series 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.629
 the audio and audiophile he is the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.949
 the coordinator of only 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.949
 animator the creator of vitoria 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.760
 and well those would be the three programs 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.190
 which I use to make the animation even 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.290
 if it's not very clear but leave your 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.270
 comments and we are clear 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.270
 well thank you very much we are seeing
