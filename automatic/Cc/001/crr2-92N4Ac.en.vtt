00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
note 10.1 and then you got what it's
sharing<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.070> I'm<00:01:47.130> showing<00:01:47.460> 5<00:01:47.700> photos<00:01:48.090> we're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sharing so I'm showing 5 photos we're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
sharing so I'm showing 5 photos we're
going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.450> into<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.860> pinko<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
going to go into that and the pinko that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
going to go into that and the pinko that
I<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:52.250> we're<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> hit<00:01:53.490> done

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I put on was one we're going to hit done

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870 
I put on was one we're going to hit done
and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.570> connecting<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> share

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and then it's connecting to the share

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
and then it's connecting to the share
and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and then that's what you see if I just

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310 
and then that's what you see if I just
do<00:01:59.390> landscape<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.840> course<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
do landscape and then of course you can

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.499 
do landscape and then of course you can
do<00:02:01.409> enormous<00:02:01.649> things<00:02:02.040> where<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.479> where<00:02:03.479> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
do enormous things where you where you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.160 
do enormous things where you where you
can<00:02:03.869> change<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.610> does<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> it

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
can change now what it does is it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
can change now what it does is it
vibrates<00:02:07.170> whatever<00:02:07.560> device<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.970> are

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
vibrates whatever device you are

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.479 
vibrates whatever device you are
controlling<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.080> from<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.590> vibrate<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.370> I

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
controlling it from will vibrate so if I

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.300 
controlling it from will vibrate so if I
just<00:02:11.810> don't<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.110> hear<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.100 

see<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.700> whenever<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.180> kind<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.780> turn<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
see so whenever you kind of turn the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.200 
see so whenever you kind of turn the
page<00:02:19.320> or<00:02:19.590> whatever<00:02:20.460> you're<00:02:20.640> doing<00:02:20.850> basically

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
page or whatever you're doing basically

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.200 
page or whatever you're doing basically
it<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.930> vibrate<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.190> still<00:02:23.460> do<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it will vibrate you can still do the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.330 
it will vibrate you can still do the
depend<00:02:24.870> stuff<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.740> have<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> button<00:02:26.280> up

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
depend stuff so but you have a button up

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
depend stuff so but you have a button up
here<00:02:26.520> now<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> select<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:27.930> obviously

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
here now to select that and obviously

disappointment<00:02:54.810> things<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.410> app<00:02:55.650> now

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
disappointment things about this app now

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
disappointment things about this app now
that<00:02:56.730> they've<00:02:57.150> updated<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:59.100> it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that they've updated it is that it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.240 
that they've updated it is that it
doesn't<00:02:59.610> show<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.150> presets<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.830> s<00:03:02.010> pen

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
doesn't show the presets of the s pen

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.580 
doesn't show the presets of the s pen
and<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.330> would<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.110> S<00:03:04.350> note

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and as you would have it in the S note

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.410 
and as you would have it in the S note
application<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.550> still<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.300> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
application so you still have to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.780 
application so you still have to
manually<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.470> course<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.100> can't<00:03:08.340> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
manually go in of course you can't you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.240 
manually go in of course you can't you
can't<00:03:09.000> select<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> pen<00:03:10.020> anyway<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:10.680> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
can't select really a pen anyway but it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.710 
can't select really a pen anyway but it
would<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.489> been<00:03:11.610> nice<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
would have been nice to have the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.320 
would have been nice to have the
different<00:03:13.230> pens<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.680> well<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.430> unfortunately

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
different pens as well but unfortunately

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880 
different pens as well but unfortunately
just<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.959> course<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.440> still<00:03:16.680> select

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
just that of course you can still select

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.259 
just that of course you can still select
the<00:03:17.070> width<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> pen<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.700> all<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.120> stuff

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the width of the pen and all that stuff

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.250 
the width of the pen and all that stuff
one<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> other<00:03:18.840> things<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.110> I've

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
one of the other things that I've

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.310 
one of the other things that I've
noticed<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.280> zoom<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.760> here

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
noticed is that if you zoom in here

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.660 
noticed is that if you zoom in here
let's<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.410> turn<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> power<00:03:23.280> off<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.580> you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
let's just turn the power off if you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.820 
let's just turn the power off if you
zoom<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.060> here<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.900> doesn't<00:03:25.260> zoom<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.650> under

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
zoom in here it doesn't zoom in under

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.199 
zoom in here it doesn't zoom in under
the<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:27.269> also<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.400> turn<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.940> picture

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
the one and also if you turn the picture

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.940 
the one and also if you turn the picture
over<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.930> will<00:03:31.080> turn<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> picture<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:31.830> it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
over it will turn the picture but it

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.270 
over it will turn the picture but it
