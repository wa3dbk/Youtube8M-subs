00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
cheap pans so I've laid all of the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
cheap pans so I've laid all of the
season<00:05:10.520> kale<00:05:11.480> out<00:05:12.050> on<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.660> sheet<00:05:14.840> pans<00:05:15.170> I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
season kale out on to the sheet pans I

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.760 
season kale out on to the sheet pans I
dried<00:05:17.030> them<00:05:17.270> on<00:05:17.420> these<00:05:17.840> have<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.110> cooling<00:05:18.620> rack

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
dried them on these have a cooling rack

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.470 
dried them on these have a cooling rack
on<00:05:19.130> them<00:05:19.280> as<00:05:19.400> well<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.640> can<00:05:20.000> use<00:05:20.120> parchment

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
on them as well you can use parchment

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.140 
on them as well you can use parchment
paper<00:05:20.920> but<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.130> cooling<00:05:22.490> rack<00:05:22.640> gives<00:05:23.000> you<00:05:23.120> a

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
paper but the cooling rack gives you a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.420 
paper but the cooling rack gives you a
nice<00:05:23.330> circulation<00:05:24.200> around<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.770> kale

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
nice circulation around the kale

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.470 
nice circulation around the kale
so<00:05:25.700> they'll<00:05:26.570> crisp<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.380> little<00:05:27.830> bit<00:05:28.010> nicer

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
so they'll crisp up a little bit nicer

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.970 
so they'll crisp up a little bit nicer
and<00:05:29.480> I'm<00:05:29.600> putting<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.960> little<00:05:30.080> plying<00:05:30.440> sea<00:05:30.710> salt

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
and I'm putting a little plying sea salt

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.820 
and I'm putting a little plying sea salt
on<00:05:31.130> these<00:05:31.970> rather<00:05:32.690> than<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.200> tossing<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.710> it

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
on these rather than just tossing it it

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.170 
on these rather than just tossing it it
allows<00:05:34.010> me<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.310> make<00:05:34.550> sure<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.880> get<00:05:35.000> a

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180
