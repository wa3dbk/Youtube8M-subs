00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.259
 good people I find this difficult 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.790
 comment for many of you this 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.379
 it will simply be one more game 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.900
 it will simply be a simple comment 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.559
 more over here for youtube but for me it's 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.550
 much more is going back to my beginnings 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.140
 really the game that gave me 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.360
 know here on YouTube the game with the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.890
 that I have met incredible people and with 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.530
 I've been enjoying truth 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.060
 all of you on those Sunday afternoons 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.460
 of real live that we were throwing 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.100
 here for the laughs songs 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.920
 know really rich a lot of 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.120
 things that only bring me good memories 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.340
 then the bad part also came 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.290
 obviously but the truth is that I spent a lot 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.690
 good times with this game pass very 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.760
 good times and I sincerely believe that in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.410
 the start of this channel had to have 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.110
 a gap this game had to have a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.640
 hollow this modern warfare 3 game that goes 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.170
 to be a game that will come back to this 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.390
 channel this secondary channel many of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.280
 you will know me from my beginnings of 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.110
 call of duty however many others 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120
 you will simply know me of clash of 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.370
 nothing happens plants really people 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.489
 that has followed me here I thank 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 very much and sincerely is this video 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.500
 it is perhaps this game 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.690
 a part of my past that stays 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.400
 totally closed a part in which 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.080
 everyone criticized me a part in 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.340
 the one that people thought was never going 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.710
 back to get anywhere here on youtube 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.330
 that I was going to stay in the shit because 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.950
 the truth all pointed that however 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 thank you to those who support me 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.610
 this since always to those who have 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 subscribed by class of plants by 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.270
 new channel we're here again and it's 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.580
 a pleasure to comment again 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.070
 modern warfare 3 so nothing people 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.570
 we started this channel as you see it is called 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.970
 walcott but it's not going to be exclusively 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.530
 of call of duty to which I want to refer 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.289
 with this call of duty maybe it's going to 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.210
 be 50 60 percent of the content I 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.159
 I want to have a channel really because 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.929
 if I upload something if I play a game that 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.759
 like to upload it is not for example the 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.200
 main channel of clash of plants that 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.670
 I understand that for example I am playing 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.530
 some computer game to a game like that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.850
 that I like and it is a content that the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.440
 improvement not everyone is going to like 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.759
 if you stay in this channel you will have 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.619
 call of duty you are not going to have 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.590
 games because I've been a long time 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.500
 without playing but if you want to have your 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.300
 games lives 2.0 challenges I will raise gta 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.739
 I'm going to upload console games to gta 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.819
 of course they are not going to be careers or 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.060
 none of that do not worry you are going to be 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.130
 video games 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.660
 rather, doing the delayed in the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.310
 game do not think I'm going to do 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.319
 now the typical daily races neither 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.640
 nothing do not worry and the truth that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 I have many ideas for this channel a 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.030
 lots of games like I say of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.400
 sting computer I want to make draws 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 later the system of this channel goes 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.030
 to be the next one I'm going to upload a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.860
 video is valid and at the end of that video I'm going to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.870
 give three options I will give three games 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 that I want to upload next day and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.319
 you in the comments or through 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.150
 some voting system that I will put 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.340
 you can just play the game you want 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.019
 the next day and so on I 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.160
 I think he can talk a lot and the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.319
 it really can be something pretty 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.150
 entertaining I'm going to start these first 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.769
 days with modern warfare 3 I'll go up though 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.049
 be a couple of games I want to upload my 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.519
 return to modern warfare 3 next 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.500
 video that goes up is going to be my return to 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.819
 modern warfare 3 I have not know how many 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.799
 months without playing call of duty but 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.599
 very many I also want to go up black 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.760
 ops 2 I do not know if I 'll upload something two sides 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.959
 warfare I do not know the truth I do not know I'll 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.400
 to climb as I say a lot of games 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.049
 maybe I'm encouraged to play something 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.150
 of fifa with some friends and others that 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.890
 they were also asking me and games 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.480
 of computer sting that grinds the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.890
 true that the game is impossible that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.079
 I went up to the main channel some time ago and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.270
 I have not touched it for quite a while 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.950
 I would really like to upload it 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 you may do direct on this channel not 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.630
 I know because I have to look at a couple of 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.040
 things I have to catch well the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.050
 Capturing program that I do not know 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.790
 how is it going yet and what else do I have to do 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.350
 as I say a lot of things but I 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.330
 I would like to know what I have with you 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.400
 I would like this channel to have the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.320
 greatest possible reception and if 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.450
 You really know people who liked me 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.430
 in the past I saw my call videos 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.520
 come new from the main channel here 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.650

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.030

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.570

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.310
 epics people know me know that I 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.920
 annoy a lot that finally come out 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.060
 very funny reactions you know 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.620
 which is that I would sing in the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.790
 but that pretty epic and there were some 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.350
 impressive direct so I os 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.270
