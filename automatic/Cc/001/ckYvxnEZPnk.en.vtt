I hoped

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.660 
I hoped

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.620 
I thought it would feel very soft but it
felt<00:02:46.880> hard<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.709> after<00:02:49.160> after<00:02:49.850> using<00:02:50.570> my

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
shampoo two times I followed that with

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.790 
shampoo two times I followed that with
my<00:02:53.000> conditioner<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.140> I'm<00:02:54.290> gonna<00:02:54.410> stay<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.709> my

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
