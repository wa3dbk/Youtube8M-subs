is<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.280> bit<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.640> an<00:01:13.729> understatement<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:14.810> really

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170

this can be seen in various games but

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.009 
this can be seen in various games but
essentially<00:02:56.370> he<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:56.700> declaring<00:02:57.180> war<00:02:57.510> Mario

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
technically being an enemy combatant is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.080 
technically being an enemy combatant is
violating<00:03:01.680> many<00:03:01.950> things<00:03:02.280> about<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.760> Geneva

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
violating many things about the Geneva

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
well remember also what I said earlier

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.149 
well remember also what I said earlier
Mario<00:03:12.569> came<00:03:12.810> from<00:03:13.079> Brooklyn<00:03:13.590> New<00:03:13.620> York<00:03:13.739> a

this means he does understand the basic
regards<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.609> war<00:03:20.849> perhaps<00:03:21.389> not<00:03:21.719> being<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
regards of war perhaps not being the

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
non-combatants is one of the suggested

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.719 
non-combatants is one of the suggested

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
ideas but it isn't his fault right he

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.969 
ideas but it isn't his fault right he
lost<00:03:59.909> his<00:04:00.090> mind<00:04:00.329> after<00:04:00.900> all<00:04:00.930> except<00:04:01.650> his

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
lost his mind after all except his

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.580
