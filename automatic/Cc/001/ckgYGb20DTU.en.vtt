beat Arsenal 82 so that was a tough life
only<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.559> tough<00:01:00.860> night<00:01:01.100> for<00:01:01.130> these<00:01:01.370> guys<00:01:01.610> and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
only a tough night for these guys and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.450 
only a tough night for these guys and
