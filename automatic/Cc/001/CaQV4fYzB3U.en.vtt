00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
they perform this behavior so many times

that<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.530> start<00:01:28.830> seeing<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.610> tic-tac-toe

that we start seeing the tic-tac-toe

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
that we start seeing the tic-tac-toe
grids<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> sky<00:01:31.290> we're<00:01:31.950> witnessing<00:01:32.130> the

giant X's and I mean Rosalynn when you
and<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> grew<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.360> contrails<00:01:37.110> naturally

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and I grew up these contrails naturally

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
and I grew up these contrails naturally
dissipated<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> few<00:01:39.210> seconds<00:01:39.690> or<00:01:39.869> perhaps<00:01:40.259> a

dissipated in a few seconds or perhaps a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910 
dissipated in a few seconds or perhaps a
minute<00:01:40.679> max<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.940> these<00:01:42.149> things<00:01:42.539> expand<00:01:43.320> they

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
minute max but these things expand they

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.010 
minute max but these things expand they
grow<00:01:44.190> bigger<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.820> before<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
grow bigger and before you know it the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.419 
grow bigger and before you know it the
entire<00:01:46.050> sky<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.100> overcast<00:01:47.550> that's<00:01:48.000> correct

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
entire sky is overcast that's correct

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.160 
entire sky is overcast that's correct
why<00:01:50.429> do<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.789> want<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> keep<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.450> quiet<00:01:51.750> why

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
why do they want to keep this quiet why

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
why do they want to keep this quiet why
aren't<00:01:52.530> they<00:01:52.649> talking<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.580> why<00:01:53.789> why

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
aren't they talking about this why why

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.790 
aren't they talking about this why why
don't<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.600> us<00:01:54.810> talking<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.319> it<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
don't they want us talking about it and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.440 
don't they want us talking about it and
you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.340> only<00:01:56.490> come<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> conclusion<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
you can only come to the conclusion that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.059 
you can only come to the conclusion that
they're<00:01:57.720> hiding<00:01:57.899> something<00:01:58.289> now<00:01:58.679> do<00:01:58.740> you
