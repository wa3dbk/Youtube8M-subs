00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.540
 many think or think that the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.330
 food is a junk food is 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.069
 a meal because bad ass they say 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.350

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.040
 protein lentils 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.939
 delicious is this food the truth that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.560
 how tasty this is what is given to 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:23.970
 young people clean their soup 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.670

 100% everything you have here is served 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.770
 to the youth then here we have 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.100
 practically a kitchen must first 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.100
 level 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.010
 a young lady coming from the valley of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.370
 flags and that young lady arrived weighing 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.680
 forty-something kilos 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.209
 definitively he used drugs because he did not know 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.510
 fed or did not have the resources 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.950
 needed when kayaking and started is to 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.299
 those kilos came out the miss very 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.280
 answer 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.590
 the relatives did not know them in fact 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.590
 it was rehabilitated it lasted a year here 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.020
 problems we take turns to avoid 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.930
 this kind of fights in fact we have not 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.000
 had fights at the beginning if it does 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.110
 almost two years studies a little quarrel 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.370
 natural normal among young people but this 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.350
 already beat god with the pipes 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.150
 that we have given people to 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.080
 internal when you have good response 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.670
 many come with with repressions with 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.130
 courage 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.490
 some and in fact they come with a lot of courage 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.590
 be the family if they come here 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.380
 they want to remove it then by means of 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.720
 good psychological or psychological area 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.850
 we are treating yes and for that too 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.010
 Remove that resentment before society 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.540
 because you think they are are people 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.720
 battered come from families 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.720
 dysfunctional 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 if this green user of the boys 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.879
 of one of the new modules of 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.879
 addictions is 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.840
 still plays in the problem so 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.210
 we passed 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.919
 in this government people tell you not 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.320
 it hides nothing we are all working 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.030
 that's why, as the government of the 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.880
 people are working with the written 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.580
 people we are not, I'm telling you, no 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.949
 we are corrupt, you, me 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.500
 They asked to enter me without any problem 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.840
 yes you also from the facilities 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.210
 they are watching and I am hiding nothing 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.720
 the other way around I want society to know that 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.720
 we are working 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:10.379
 and this horrible horrible is a criminal is 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.139
 a school indeed they if the chilies 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.150
 they are better than some schools come out 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.370
 in society to offend to be 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.289
 assassins if we take out the 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.259
 boys without making this effort that 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.659
 is doing titanic are going to go out to 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.110
 same family environment and what they are 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.300
 doing the authorities is from the 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.860
 environment bring it here and train 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.319
 the two so that by the time 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.150
 come out the two rehabilitated 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.150
 internal family
