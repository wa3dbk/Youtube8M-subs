00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.860
 My manny is 41 years old and I restore 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 old scooter is reminder to see your 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 different brands as well as the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.080
 assemblers of cars straps this is the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.380
 time of paranÃ¡ 56 in italy and the scooter 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.869
 in Italy in 1987 they also came to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 50 more in the interests of evolution 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 economic well let's talk right staff 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 do not have the money to have an expensive career 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 everything then many advertisements and support 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.489
 both the scooter and the wasp focus 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.739
 this side of dede this advance 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.750
 and in parallel to this too. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 between people who had scooter as 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.039
 means of transport a thing a little 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 healthier and not so usual 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.250
 so they start marking this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.910
 But as I said these two tips 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.309
 in the economic market is many people the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 mail had police scooter had 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 top scooter had no motorcycle on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.550
 Brazil at the time were expensive things 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.769
 so they start te rreta on this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 in this situation and on the other 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.880
 people who had to walk and said 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 which had much the playboy of the era wore 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 lambreta has a nostalgic who is the guy 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 who lived the time was marked by 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.530
 and nowadays there are a number of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 who then collects his own scooter 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 has a strong name on the market and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.400
 I have customers who are young 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.250
 They inherited from the father and grandfather also 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 So there are people I feel 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.119
 simply by name or by 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 Such a strong appeal ended up 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.140
 interesting begin to search the name 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 and sees the influence that has the most 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.460
 influence in the world then they 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.470
 really dictated much at this time in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670
 the 50s and 60s and see if it really 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.619
 It was something that brought a lot of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.810
 influence I have clients who have to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.189
 stroll for a weekend trip 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 there are a lot of people collecting cars too 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.899
 then you see that you have a face that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.100
 have 40 50 100 old cars saved 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 on an easel then these memories 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.729
 end up composing also this environment is the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.060
 first active mower in December 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.439
 87 were not in compliance with the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 in the complex 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.500
 restore or accomplish anything simply 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.049
 buy beauty 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 I got a beautiful scooter in town one 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.440
 another, but it is not because staff do not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.940
 I paid too much attention so I did not have 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.870
 internet in which such communication 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.580
 Quick, then I bought 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.200
 but by musical influence it had a 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.239
 people who enjoy an old rock all over 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.099
 had a class like that 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.620
 has always been focused on this is a young 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.569
 save the rock right then I had a scooter 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.430
 from that moment on I started to 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.739
 story of one friend from another made the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.569
 my right several times and in 2000 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.760
 there really was no way the business was 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.190
 began to take more professional form 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.519
 I really decided to open the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.709
 workshops just be there around 14 15 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.900
 thousand to leave one fully ready, right? 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 and there normally to them in state 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.290
 even terminal knows was played in a 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.260
 corner 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.780
 all destroyed even know of that one 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.599
 point to trash is a leap in the 80's 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.890
 for example she made the scooter ride 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.310
 I despised people because I can not 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.379
 go over then then Kim started 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.329
 put aside while the adaptation of 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.129
 grotesque parts that you see too 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.890
 because he did not have the right material to 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.530
 do anything then that's it too 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.269
 was walking away not ceasing to be 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.400
 a legal thing I must have more or 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.500
 less forty-something 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.419
 lambretas the session to restore not 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.280
 they are pretty ready that along the 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.319
 time has been buying will appear the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.669
 opportunity and I'm going shopping 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.010
 mounting a stock then the mopeds 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.260
 are memories that in the future 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.669
 To be a donor and a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.129
 bloody 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.260
 can come back to life again the idea 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.450
 is that they have life is delicious because 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.280
 As I said at the beginning, you get a 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.010
 thing was dead that was about to 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.870
 go to scrap and you make her come back 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.480
 To have life then I mean I have a lot 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.730
 satisfaction because she comes back 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 really walk and the owner also because 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.940
 Why do not you pretend to be a dream? 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.099
 that few people do it 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.900
 in Brazil today I make a way 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.489
 technique I really like the subject 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.379
 I've been in love with the subject for a long time. 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.329
 time could suddenly 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.040
 to invest a motorcycle something that 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.440
 more money goes down but I find myself 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.849
 really something that gives me pleasure and I 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.260
 I have a story with scooters and 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.810
 talk then it struck me 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.790
 Quite right, but it gives a lot of satisfaction 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.349
 having the forehead had the feeling that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.510
 always puts a good feeling because 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.370
 if you know who will be receiving receive 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.769
 paid for it is a job that earns 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.060
 money everything but it involves feeling 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.060
 So what are you doing?
