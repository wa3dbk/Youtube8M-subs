that I just want to hit the speaker when
I<00:04:14.670> hear<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:16.799> all<00:04:17.040> fun<00:04:18.000> aside<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:18.780> easy<00:04:18.989> to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I hear it but all fun aside it's easy to

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920 
I hear it but all fun aside it's easy to
forget<00:04:19.430> how<00:04:20.430> difficult<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:21.030> was<00:04:21.210> then<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.750> get
