and even you know other things but let's
tip<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.970> scales<00:01:11.240> today<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.720> just<00:01:12.590> one<00:01:12.740> string

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
tip the scales today on just one string

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.280 
tip the scales today on just one string
in<00:01:13.850> k<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.240> case<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.420> C<00:01:14.659> major<00:01:14.689> let's<00:01:15.140> take

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
in k in the case of C major let's take

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.230 
in k in the case of C major let's take
something<00:01:15.650> simple<00:01:16.340> let's<00:01:16.729> do<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
something simple let's do it on the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.419 
something simple let's do it on the
second<00:01:17.540> string<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.530> some<00:01:18.710> be<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.100> listen

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
second string is that some be so listen

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.489 
second string is that some be so listen
on<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:19.759> first<00:01:19.969> fret<00:01:20.179> which<00:01:20.359> is<00:01:20.509> C<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.409> you

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
on the first fret which is C so you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:25.099 
on the first fret which is C so you
should<00:01:21.649> play<00:01:21.799> something<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:22.130> this

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.359 

then<00:01:26.109> you<00:01:26.170> can<00:01:26.320> continue<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:30.039> then<00:01:30.189> work<00:01:30.340> your

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
then you can continue and then work your

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.200 
then you can continue and then work your
way<00:01:30.549> back<00:01:32.490> okay<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.609> your<00:01:33.729> do<00:01:33.819> it<00:01:33.939> like<00:01:34.060> this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
way back okay and your do it like this

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.789 
way back okay and your do it like this
for<00:01:34.270> all<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.719> strings<00:01:35.079> and<00:01:35.289> not<00:01:35.409> for<00:01:35.590> all<00:01:35.649> your

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
for all the strings and not for all your

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.260 
for all the strings and not for all your
scales<00:01:36.069> that's<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.520> very<00:01:36.700> good<00:01:36.729> way<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
scales that's a very good way to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.449 
scales that's a very good way to
practice<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.859> then<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.100> course<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.340> can

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
practice and then of course you can

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:47.310 
practice and then of course you can
start<00:01:39.609> improvising

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.900 

exercise<00:01:48.320> has<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.130> using<00:01:49.550> only<00:01:49.670> one

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
exercise has to do with using only one

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.780 
exercise has to do with using only one
string<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.390> mixing<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.930> up<00:01:51.020> with<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:52.670> know

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
string and mixing it up with a you know

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.020 
string and mixing it up with a you know
a<00:01:52.820> simple<00:01:53.410> picking<00:01:54.410> exercise<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
a simple picking exercise so the the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.730 
a simple picking exercise so the the
cell<00:01:56.300> we're<00:01:56.480> going<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.720> use<00:01:56.870> is<00:01:57.140> take<00:01:57.470> three

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
cell we're going to use is take three

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.410 
cell we're going to use is take three
straight<00:01:57.980> three<00:01:58.010> notes<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.940> them<00:01:59.120> from<00:01:59.300> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
straight three notes of them from the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.040 
straight three notes of them from the
scale<00:01:59.660> in<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.990> case<00:02:00.200> we're<00:02:00.440> playing<00:02:00.650> CDE

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
to go to PF g you see my fingering is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
to go to PF g you see my fingering is
different<00:02:36.080> now<00:02:36.230> i'm<00:02:36.380> using<00:02:36.410> first<00:02:36.980> second<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
different now i'm using first second and

was using first second and forward with

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.820 
was using first second and forward with
a<00:02:43.580> stretch<00:02:43.880> between<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.360> two<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.470> first<00:02:45.620> two

a stretch between the two the first two
fingers<00:02:46.040> now<00:02:46.760> these<00:02:46.970> three<00:02:47.210> figures<00:02:47.540> actually

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
fingers now these three figures actually

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.190 
fingers now these three figures actually
are<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.620> only<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.520> your<00:02:49.959> encounter<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.170> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
are the only one you your encounter on a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
are the only one you your encounter on a
regular<00:02:51.620> diatonic<00:02:52.250> scale<00:02:52.580> which<00:02:52.850> means<00:02:53.030> major

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
regular diatonic scale which means major

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.060 
regular diatonic scale which means major
scale<00:02:53.450> minor<00:02:53.660> scale<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.260> different<00:02:54.920> modes

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
scale minor scale and different modes

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.650 
scale minor scale and different modes
alright<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:55.820> really<00:02:56.000> interesting<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
alright so it's really interesting and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.870 
alright so it's really interesting and
it's<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:56.870> useful<00:02:57.110> because<00:02:57.700> even<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:58.790> you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's really useful because even if you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's really useful because even if you
just<00:02:58.910> play<00:02:59.270> AC<00:02:59.540> major<00:02:59.570> you're<00:02:59.989> still

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
just play AC major you're still

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.740 
just play AC major you're still
practicing<00:03:00.800> enough<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.910> help<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.270> play<00:03:02.450> all

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
practicing enough to help you play all

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.030 
practicing enough to help you play all
different<00:03:03.140> modes<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.500> all<00:03:03.590> different<00:03:03.739> kind

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
different modes and all different kind

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.270 
different modes and all different kind
of<00:03:04.070> stuff<00:03:04.250> right<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.650> let's<00:03:06.650> apply<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.950> same

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
of stuff right so let's apply the same

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.910 
of stuff right so let's apply the same
cell<00:03:07.640> throughout<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.510> fall<00:03:08.720> neck<00:03:09.110> ok<00:03:09.860> so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
cell throughout the fall neck ok so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.800 
cell throughout the fall neck ok so
here's<00:03:10.280> basically<00:03:10.670> what<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:10.940> would<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.510> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
here's basically what it would be like a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.480 
here's basically what it would be like a
CBE

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
CBE

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.210 
CBE
we<00:03:14.300> go<00:03:14.480> up<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.050> next<00:03:15.320> available<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:16.040> note

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
we go up to the next available we note

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.730 
we go up to the next available we note
of<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.610> scale<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:17.750> an<00:03:17.870> F<00:03:18.020> on<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.320> 6th

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
of the scale so it's an F on the 6th

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:29.729 
of the scale so it's an F on the 6th
spread<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.430> use<00:03:21.220> I'm<00:03:22.220> qg<00:03:22.700> g

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.890 

drop<00:03:30.739> through<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.129> whole<00:03:31.310> neck<00:03:31.730> okay<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.420> let

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
drop through the whole neck okay so let

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.420 
drop through the whole neck okay so let
me<00:03:32.930> show<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.409> from<00:03:33.590> close<00:03:33.799> up<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:34.129> play

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
me show it to you from close up I play

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.610 
me show it to you from close up I play
slow<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.239> bit<00:03:35.420> faster<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:35.989> then

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
slow and then a bit faster and then

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.899 
slow and then a bit faster and then
maybe<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.920> little<00:03:37.040> bit<00:03:37.220> faster<00:03:37.370> i'm<00:03:37.670> not<00:03:37.790> going

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
maybe a little bit faster i'm not going

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.940 
maybe a little bit faster i'm not going
to<00:03:37.940> go<00:03:38.060> over<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:39.080> fast<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.409> you<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.650> still

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
to go over the fast so you can still

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.979 
to go over the fast so you can still
check<00:03:40.099> out<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.370> technique<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.849> will<00:03:41.239> always

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
check out the technique and will always

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:54.740 
check out the technique and will always
use<00:03:42.140> alternate<00:03:42.620> picking<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.980> here<00:03:43.580> goes

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:30.150 

hey

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.440 

very<00:04:31.160> well<00:04:31.280> then<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.730> that's<00:04:32.000> what<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.180> sounds

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
very well then so that's what it sounds

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.000 
very well then so that's what it sounds
like<00:04:32.480> now<00:04:32.750> if<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.140> know<00:04:33.530> more<00:04:33.710> about<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
like now if you know more about the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.950 
like now if you know more about the
guitar<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.820> can<00:04:34.850> still<00:04:35.150> apply<00:04:35.300> this<00:04:35.420> exercise

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
guitar you can still apply this exercise

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.780 
guitar you can still apply this exercise
to<00:04:35.990> more<00:04:36.290> complicated<00:04:36.740> stuff<00:04:36.890> so<00:04:37.190> for<00:04:37.700> example

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
to more complicated stuff so for example

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.550 
to more complicated stuff so for example
instead<00:04:38.270> of<00:04:38.450> playing<00:04:38.660> major<00:04:38.990> scales<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.440> can

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
instead of playing major scales you can

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.380 
instead of playing major scales you can
play<00:04:39.710> minor<00:04:39.920> scales<00:04:40.280> or<00:04:40.460> all<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.970> diet<00:04:41.210> honey

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
modify the scale so let's say instead of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.940 
modify the scale so let's say instead of
a<00:05:02.150> minor<00:05:02.540> which<00:05:02.780> is<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.960> same<00:05:03.050> as<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.290> major<00:05:03.470> we
