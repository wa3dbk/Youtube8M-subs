galley there are two drawers with
refrigeration<00:02:01.619> over<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> there's<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
refrigeration over there and there's a

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.770 
refrigeration over there and there's a
freezer<00:02:03.060> over<00:02:03.420> here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
