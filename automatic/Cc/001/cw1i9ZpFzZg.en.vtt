00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
of a faraway fuzz sound in the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.619 
of a faraway fuzz sound in the
background<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.970> you<00:00:53.970> know<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.269> is<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
background and you know this is this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.450 
background and you know this is this
thing<00:00:54.899> work

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.280 

nice<00:01:05.059> because<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.330> got<00:01:05.600> wit<00:01:05.780> with<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:05.960> tone

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
nice because you got wit with the tone

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.719 
nice because you got wit with the tone
you<00:01:06.560> can<00:01:06.740> roll<00:01:07.010> all<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.390> know<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.930> gritty

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
you can roll all the you know the gritty

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.840 
you can roll all the you know the gritty
stuff<00:01:10.729> out

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.390 

and<00:01:16.390> they<00:01:16.479> get<00:01:16.659> really<00:01:16.960> dark

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:35.220 

or<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.060> do<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.520 

so<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:37.100> fuzzy<00:01:37.400> later<00:01:37.900> gets<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.080> big<00:01:39.230> thumbs

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
so the fuzzy later gets the big thumbs

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.390 
so the fuzzy later gets the big thumbs
up<00:01:40.210> anytime<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.450> get<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.930> pedal<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:42.890> use<00:01:43.160> it<00:01:43.190> on

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
up anytime I get a pedal and I use it on

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.710 
up anytime I get a pedal and I use it on
a<00:01:43.460> track<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.720> works<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:47.090> usually<00:01:47.480> stays

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
a track and it works I it usually stays

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.850 
a track and it works I it usually stays
in<00:01:47.930> my<00:01:48.080> system<00:01:48.500> because<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:50.479> me<00:01:50.660> it<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.380> look<00:01:51.680> at

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
in my system because to me it I look at

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.790 
in my system because to me it I look at
it<00:01:52.010> like<00:01:52.220> I<00:01:52.520> spent<00:01:53.120> money<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> pedal<00:01:53.990> but

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
it like I spent money on the pedal but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.469 
it like I spent money on the pedal but
then<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.070> made<00:01:55.250> me<00:01:55.490> money<00:01:55.729> because<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.210> was<00:01:56.330> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
then it made me money because it was the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.359 
then it made me money because it was the
right<00:01:56.510> thing<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.320> have<00:01:57.530> at<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.100> time

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
right thing to have at the right time

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.810 
right thing to have at the right time
and<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.940> got<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.300> limiter<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:01.130> think<00:02:01.729> I

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
and I got the limiter and and I think I

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.850
