00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.200 
so basically i i'd be looking for
different<00:01:15.330> solutions<00:01:16.580> never<00:01:17.580> found<00:01:17.850> anything

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
different solutions never found anything

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
range that I felt was reasonable so I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
range that I felt was reasonable so I
just<00:01:24.299> kept<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> braids<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.270> one<00:01:27.270> day<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.860> was

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
