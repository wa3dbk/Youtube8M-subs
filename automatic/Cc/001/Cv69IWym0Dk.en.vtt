00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.840
 good green 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.840
 then to me 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.480
 first here as how many websites do I think 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.650
 that are like three and a half liters there 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.430
 Take him out a little because he's here three 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.450
 liters of water and the piloncillo says that 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.780
 I put him 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.820
 it's a kilo of brown sugar 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.820
 here is a kilo of brown sugar 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.410
 what more of the web 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.030
 count how much cinnamon 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.030
 A little bit 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 all right 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 the Lord 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 and then first it gets and then it 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 turn on true 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.580
 to see a cinnamon tube low cinnamon 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.580
 and aniseed you also said 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.490
 all that anise 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 is that it is very strong gives a lot of aroma 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.259
 because then it 's like when you're 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.259
 throwing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.909
 what your fingers hold that you have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 big and fat good then that 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.159
 thing is a dad and an anise card 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.320
 and then I'll start with a lid 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.040
 top 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 why 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.050
 why 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 ok and then I guess it's going to take 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.680
 a while 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.950
 and it can not be faster 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.930
 since you arrived 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 and this can be done in today express 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 why why 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.850
 I 've done it the truth I do not know 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.850
 secure decision or what ever 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.450
 but in theory you could 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.610
 that 's just what it is based on 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.720
 movement with hot water is going 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.530
 dissolving 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.530
 if you want like when you grow up and later 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.530
 now 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.340
 then you have to be removing that 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.340
 Occasionally 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.819
 'roll' 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.590
 ok then know you have to remember the 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.010
 bread 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 sliced one centimeter true 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.280
 and this bread that is fresh 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.740
 hard of which 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.120
 ok to see I hope hard bread awaits you 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 hard how many days 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.519
 ok for 23 days and it is already ideal for 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.519
 capirotada 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.510
 because that foam does not stop being 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.709
 with butter 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.689
 and that's it 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.489
 you lose the foam because if not and 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.489
 spill of liquid 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.680
 It is true that they are already feeling 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.680
 is 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.879
 but if it is already diluting 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.950
 is fulfilled 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.520
 at 3 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.980
 as I already know what it's going 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.140
 going down 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.140
 a little bit the flame 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.290
 this city 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.660
 okay 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.660
 at medium heat for what
