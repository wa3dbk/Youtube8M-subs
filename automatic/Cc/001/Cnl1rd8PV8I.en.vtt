00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
with we have a brand new bounty tracker

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.620 
with we have a brand new bounty tracker
in<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.620> reef<00:04:48.010> this<00:04:48.550> time<00:04:48.820> his<00:04:49.000> name<00:04:49.030> is<00:04:49.330> Berg

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
in the reef this time his name is Berg

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.210 
in the reef this time his name is Berg
and<00:04:49.900> he<00:04:50.320> will<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.590> exactly<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:51.130> same

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
bounties as Xander does on the tower so

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.629 
bounties as Xander does on the tower so

certain place to get your bounties you
can<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.410> you<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:56.889> do<00:04:57.010> everything<00:04:57.220> in

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
can just you can just do everything in

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.890 
can just you can just do everything in
the<00:04:57.760> reef<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.120> not<00:04:58.330> have<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.600> worry<00:04:58.660> about

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
the reef and not have to worry about

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.330 
the reef and not have to worry about
going<00:04:59.260> back<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.680> tower<00:04:59.889> if<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.190> don't

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
going back to the tower if you don't

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.890 
going back to the tower if you don't
need<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.760> but<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> course<00:05:01.360> there<00:05:01.510> is<00:05:01.630> still

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
need to but of course there is still

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.629 
need to but of course there is still
things<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.260> do<00:05:02.410> in<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.650> tower<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.280> will<00:05:03.460> talk

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
things to do in the tower as I will talk

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.430 
things to do in the tower as I will talk
about<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:04.030> my<00:05:04.120> next<00:05:04.360> video<00:05:04.660> we<00:05:04.960> then<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.290> a

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
about in my next video we then have a

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.650 
about in my next video we then have a
volt<00:05:05.800> space<00:05:06.070> next<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.550> him<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:06.880> little<00:05:07.090> bit<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.389> a

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
volt space next to him a little bit of a

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.300 
volt space next to him a little bit of a
smaller<00:05:08.020> vault<00:05:08.290> space<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.680> what<00:05:08.800> we<00:05:08.919> have<00:05:09.100> in

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
smaller vault space to what we have in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.070 
smaller vault space to what we have in
the<00:05:09.430> tower<00:05:09.639> but<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.210> exactly<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.870> same

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
the tower but it is exactly the same

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.450 
the tower but it is exactly the same
vault<00:05:11.350> as<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.919> have<00:05:12.070> in<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.250> tower

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
vault as the one you have in the tower

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.250 
vault as the one you have in the tower
so<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:12.970> won't<00:05:13.120> have<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.330> vault<00:05:13.690> spaces<00:05:14.139> to

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
so you won't have to vault spaces to

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.409 
so you won't have to vault spaces to
just<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.680> one<00:05:14.979> we<00:05:15.280> then<00:05:15.490> get<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:15.729> really<00:05:16.150> quick
