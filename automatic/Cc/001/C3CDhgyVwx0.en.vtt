00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.149 

it's<00:00:38.839> gonna<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:39.079> much<00:00:39.260> harder<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.710> draw<00:00:39.980> your

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159

lips<00:00:40.370> on<00:00:40.989> with<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.140> chap<00:00:42.379> state<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:42.859> it

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
lips on with the chap state because it

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.979 
lips on with the chap state because it
makes<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.339> slippery<00:00:44.589> but<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.800> get<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:45.979> idea

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.119 

and<00:00:50.989> remember<00:00:51.559> it's<00:00:51.649> going<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.829> be<00:00:51.920> much

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
and remember it's going to be much

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.619 
and remember it's going to be much
easier<00:00:52.159> to<00:00:52.549> put<00:00:52.729> your<00:00:52.820> lip<00:00:53.059> liner<00:00:53.269> on<00:00:53.449> when

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629
