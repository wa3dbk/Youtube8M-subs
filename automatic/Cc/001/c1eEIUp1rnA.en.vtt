00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.410 
chest and it looks like there's a small
mallet<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.530> place<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.159> breaks<00:01:55.430> them<00:01:55.729> when

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
mallet in place that breaks them when

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.960 
mallet in place that breaks them when

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
think you can disable that mallet just

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.170 
think you can disable that mallet just
by<00:02:00.560> slipping<00:02:00.829> your<00:02:01.040> tool<00:02:01.250> into<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> chest<00:02:02.000> and
