00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.939 

what<00:00:00.510> was<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.750> core<00:00:00.989> reason<00:00:01.319> how<00:00:01.650> come<00:00:01.860> you

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
what was the core reason how come you

00:00:01.949 --> 00:02:24.090 
what was the core reason how come you
actually<00:00:02.280> launched<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.149> new<00:00:03.419> wireless

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.370 

so<00:02:25.100> how<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.760> launch<00:02:26.210> any<00:02:26.510> brand<00:02:26.780> why<00:02:26.990> not<00:02:27.170> just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
so how can launch any brand why not just

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.400 
so how can launch any brand why not just
add<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> sub<00:02:28.250> brand<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.880> Rogers<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.290> is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
add a sub brand to Rogers that is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.650 
add a sub brand to Rogers that is
unlimited<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:31.130> talking<00:02:31.520> tax<00:02:31.670> or<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> sub

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
unlimited just talking tax or a sub

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.570 
unlimited just talking tax or a sub
brand<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.110> find<00:02:33.350> out<00:02:33.500> instead<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.860> creating

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
brand to find out instead of creating

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.990 
brand to find out instead of creating
something<00:02:34.820> new<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.300> market<00:02:35.620> with

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
something new in the market with

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.180 
something new in the market with
potentially<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.209> same<00:02:38.450> hand<00:02:38.720> handsets<00:02:39.290> just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
potentially the same hand handsets just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:04:14.240 
potentially the same hand handsets just
add<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> cheaper

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.780 

yeah<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.570> for<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.920> zones<00:04:17.920> that<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.520> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
yeah and for the zones that you have it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.580 
yeah and for the zones that you have it
sounds<00:04:19.090> like<00:04:19.209> it's<00:04:19.360> similar<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.140> what<00:04:20.290> Fido

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
sounds like it's similar to what Fido

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.010 
sounds like it's similar to what Fido
has<00:04:20.860> right<00:04:21.100> now<00:04:21.130> or<00:04:21.850> even<00:04:22.000> what<00:04:22.330> wind<00:04:22.570> has<00:04:22.810> or

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
has right now or even what wind has or

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.320 
has right now or even what wind has or
even<00:04:23.070> Mobilicity<00:04:24.070> for<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.340> matter<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.910> it

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
even Mobilicity for that matter is it

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.570 
even Mobilicity for that matter is it
going<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.510> be<00:04:25.600> in<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> core<00:04:26.020> city<00:04:26.320> areas<00:04:26.800> are

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
going to be in the core city areas are

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:54.890 
going to be in the core city areas are
you<00:04:27.730> going<00:04:27.940> after<00:04:28.060> those<00:04:28.360> market<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:28.810> well

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.030 

well<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.140> certainly<00:04:56.320> seems<00:04:56.650> like<00:04:56.890> you're

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
well it certainly seems like you're

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.280 
well it certainly seems like you're
going<00:04:57.220> directly<00:04:57.670> after<00:04:58.090> wind<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.630> Mobilicity

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
going directly after wind and Mobilicity

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:19.670 
going directly after wind and Mobilicity
even<00:04:59.530> public<00:04:59.920> mobile<00:05:00.250> as<00:05:00.430> well<00:05:15.420> yeah<00:05:18.060> yeah<00:05:19.060> I

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
even public mobile as well yeah yeah I

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.350 
even public mobile as well yeah yeah I
guess<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:21.190> guess<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.670> just<00:05:21.700> comes<00:05:22.060> down<00:05:22.180> to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
guess so I guess it just comes down to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.430 
guess so I guess it just comes down to
timing<00:05:23.320> wise<00:05:23.800> right<00:05:24.340> because<00:05:25.210> new<00:05:25.450> like<00:05:26.230> I

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
timing wise right because new like I

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.930 
timing wise right because new like I
know<00:05:26.620> that<00:05:26.740> reuters<00:05:27.220> has<00:05:27.340> always<00:05:27.520> been<00:05:27.760> there
