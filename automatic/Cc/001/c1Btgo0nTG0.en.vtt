catfish rigs with the integrated floats

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.179 
catfish rigs with the integrated floats
that<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.130> much<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.820> Santee<00:00:24.510> rig<00:00:24.949> they<00:00:25.949> put

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that are much like a Santee rig they put

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.120 
that are much like a Santee rig they put
off<00:00:26.310> noise<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> vibration<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.619> talked<00:00:28.949> a

off noise and vibration and I talked a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.240 
off noise and vibration and I talked a
little<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.679> results

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
little bit about some of the results

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.080 
little bit about some of the results
that<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> had<00:00:33.350> using<00:00:34.350> sound<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.399> my<00:00:35.579> catfish

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that I had using sound with my catfish

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.650 
that I had using sound with my catfish
rigs<00:00:36.710> when<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> did<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> video<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.730> didn't<00:00:39.570> go

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
rigs when I did that video I didn't go

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
rigs when I did that video I didn't go
into<00:00:39.809> great<00:00:39.899> detail<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.239> had

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
into great detail but I have had

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.580 
into great detail but I have had
tremendous<00:00:42.930> success<00:00:43.969> using<00:00:45.379> rattles<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
tremendous success using rattles and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.220 
tremendous success using rattles and
vibration<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:47.850> catfish<00:00:48.300> rig<00:00:48.600> when

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
vibration with my catfish rig when

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
vibration with my catfish rig when
targeting<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.010> three<00:00:50.550> species<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.149> catfish

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
targeting all three species of catfish

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.979 
targeting all three species of catfish
and<00:00:51.809> over<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> past<00:00:53.039> few<00:00:53.489> months<00:00:53.840> through<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and over the past few months through the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
and over the past few months through the
course<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> fall<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> winter<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.760> spent<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
course of the fall and winter I spent a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
course of the fall and winter I spent a
significant<00:00:58.170> amount<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.500> time<00:00:58.739> experimenting

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
significant amount of time experimenting

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
significant amount of time experimenting
with<00:01:00.390> rigs<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.050> had<00:01:01.230> rattles<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> rigs<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
with rigs that had rattles and rigs that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509 
with rigs that had rattles and rigs that
didn't<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.690> found<00:01:03.989> those<00:01:04.470> rigs<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.309> had

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
didn't and I found those rigs that had

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.370 
didn't and I found those rigs that had
rattles<00:01:06.060> integrated<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.939> most<00:01:08.939> often

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
rattles integrated into them most often

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
rattles integrated into them most often
were<00:01:10.380> much<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:11.070> effective<00:01:11.670> than<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
were much more effective than the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
were much more effective than the
traditional<00:01:12.750> catfish<00:01:13.229> rigs<00:01:13.530> without<00:01:14.040> rattles

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
traditional catfish rigs without rattles

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.830 
traditional catfish rigs without rattles
so<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.390> began<00:01:15.780> using<00:01:16.140> those<00:01:16.890> whisker<00:01:17.400> seeker

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
so I began using those whisker seeker

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
so I began using those whisker seeker
catfish<00:01:18.840> rigs<00:01:19.140> catfish<00:01:19.799> lures<00:01:20.159> whatever<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
catfish rigs catfish lures whatever you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.350 
catfish rigs catfish lures whatever you
want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> call<00:01:21.119> them<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> rattle<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
want to call them with that rattle and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.820 
want to call them with that rattle and
experimenting<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.540> half<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.840> rods<00:01:25.350> with

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
experimenting with half my rods with

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.890 
experimenting with half my rods with
those<00:01:26.100> rigs<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> half<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> rods<00:01:27.479> without

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
those rigs and half the rods without

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
those rigs and half the rods without
well<00:01:28.280> doing<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.900> found<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.500> most<00:01:32.009> often

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
well doing that I found that most often

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.319 
well doing that I found that most often
those<00:01:33.329> rigs<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.110> were<00:01:34.229> producing<00:01:34.770> noise

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
those rigs that were producing noise

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.200 
those rigs that were producing noise
without<00:01:36.329> fish<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.229> other<00:01:37.350> catfish<00:01:37.829> rigs

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
without fish all the other catfish rigs

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.200 
without fish all the other catfish rigs
so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.530> ran<00:01:40.530> into<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.920> dilemma<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.909> point

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so I ran into a dilemma at that point

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.490 
so I ran into a dilemma at that point
because<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.159> don't<00:01:44.159> always<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:45.270> floats<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.290> my

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
because I don't always use floats on my

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.580 
because I don't always use floats on my
catfish<00:01:46.950> rigs<00:01:47.659> back<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> time<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
catfish rigs back at that time in the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.539 
catfish rigs back at that time in the
winter<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> fall<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.520> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
winter and the fall I was doing a lot of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.190 
winter and the fall I was doing a lot of
fishing<00:01:54.380> with<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> rods<00:01:56.060> suspended<00:01:57.200> control

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
fishing with the rods suspended control

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.580 
fishing with the rods suspended control
drifting<00:01:58.790> targeting<00:01:59.899> structure<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.350> big

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
drifting targeting structure for big

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
drifting targeting structure for big
catfish<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.640> didn't<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.420> floats<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.170> my

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
catfish and I didn't want floats and my

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.119 
catfish and I didn't want floats and my
catfish<00:02:04.950> rigs<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.659> called<00:02:07.439> old<00:02:07.619> Matt<00:02:07.860> that

I love these rigs with the

I<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.500> suspend<00:02:28.739> baits<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.480> fish

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
I can suspend baits so I can fish

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.740 
I can suspend baits so I can fish
vertically<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.069> hold<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.519> rod

a lot of theory behind that everybody

a lot of theory behind that everybody

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.659 
probably knows that catfish are very

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
sensitive to sound and vibration it's

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.339 
sensitive to sound and vibration it's
something<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.270> catfish<00:05:31.599> anglers<00:05:31.960> really

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
something that catfish anglers really

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.800 
something that catfish anglers really
haven't<00:05:32.740> capitalized<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.699> and<00:05:34.030> it's

haven't capitalized on and it's

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.939 
haven't capitalized on and it's
something<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:35.169> haven't<00:05:35.469> heard<00:05:35.680> much<00:05:35.889> about

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
over the years people using different

rigs<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.860> have<00:05:42.759> a<00:05:42.789> lot<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.030> theories<00:05:43.419> behind<00:05:43.599> why

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
rigs I have a lot of theories behind why

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.770 
rigs I have a lot of theories behind why
it<00:05:44.050> works<00:05:44.409> and<00:05:44.620> why<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:44.889> makes<00:05:45.159> a<00:05:45.310> difference

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
it works and why it makes a difference

it works and why it makes a difference
