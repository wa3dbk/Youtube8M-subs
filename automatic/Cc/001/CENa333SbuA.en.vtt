00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.010 
does make it unique to the person I mean
honestly<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.120> thought<00:04:21.390> about<00:04:21.630> who<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> was

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
honestly I thought about who I was

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.659 
honestly I thought about who I was
giving<00:04:22.350> in<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:23.040> design<00:04:23.340> they<00:04:23.550> would

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
giving in to and what design they would

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.540 
giving in to and what design they would
probably<00:04:23.850> like<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> best<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.660> what<00:04:24.750> colors

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
probably like the best and what colors

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.420 
probably like the best and what colors
and<00:04:25.639> then<00:04:26.599> I<00:04:26.720> just<00:04:26.900> bought<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> pack<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.099> you

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and then I just bought a pack of the you

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.129 
and then I just bought a pack of the you
know<00:04:28.520> off-brand<00:04:29.030> dry<00:04:29.300> erase<00:04:29.539> markers<00:04:29.930> which
