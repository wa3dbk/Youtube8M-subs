going to place them on top of the edge

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.880 
going to place them on top of the edge
of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> liner<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.869> give<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> softer<00:01:22.939> wash

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
of the liner to give it a softer wash

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.330 
of the liner to give it a softer wash
creating<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.490> uniform<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> natural<00:01:29.159> look

just keep in mind that gold for a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
just keep in mind that gold for a
daytime<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.520> easy<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> overdo<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.930> try<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
daytime can be easy to overdo so try to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
daytime can be easy to overdo so try to
stick<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.520> eyeshadow<00:01:35.909> colors

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

defined<00:03:22.130> crease<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:23.000> because<00:03:23.210> in<00:03:23.330> photos<00:03:23.780> it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
defined crease just because in photos it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.300 
defined crease just because in photos it
makes<00:03:24.140> my<00:03:24.290> eyes<00:03:24.320> look<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.740> little<00:03:24.860> bit<00:03:25.070> bigger

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.670 
makes my eyes look a little bit bigger

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
right so for the night time I highly

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.810 
right so for the night time I highly
recommend<00:03:29.990> applying<00:03:30.710> a<00:03:31.160> color<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.700> crease

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
recommend applying a color in the crease

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.310 
recommend applying a color in the crease
but<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.300> course<00:03:32.570> there<00:03:32.990> are<00:03:33.110> endless

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
but of course there are endless

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.290 
but of course there are endless
possibilities<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:34.550> can<00:03:34.580> always<00:03:34.970> add<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
possibilities you can always add the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.840 
possibilities you can always add the
matte<00:03:35.480> Brown<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.500> outer<00:03:36.860> area<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.670> your

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
eyelid as well and that will also create

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.340 
eyelid as well and that will also create
