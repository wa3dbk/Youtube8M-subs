00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 my name is wim van braam i am since 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.839
 1998 at van de gans bv 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.910
 heerenveen and there I am a repairman 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 wooden wind instruments 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 and we are going to show you how saxophone 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.120
 will be overhauled from the old one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 Saxony full of all kinds of technical 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 defects 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.570
 transformed into a new saxophone 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 where all technical defects removed 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 are these gentle just who we go 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 revise it is a jemma that later 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 silver plated, it is around 30 to 35 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.030
 years old 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.180
 he has endured his time well there 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.280
 is indeed a number of damage 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 spots in the body still has it in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 got hold of fire because it is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 lots of room for play 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.830
 in on valves 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.480
 The valves must now one by one and 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.469
 we try to do that in the past 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.469
 remove clearances 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 uniquely extracts the ashes I put here 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.379
 in the shelf and as soon as I need this 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.620
 respects what action in which valve 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.620
 hears 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 are also some things to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.729
 room for slack in on valves 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 posts with the valve in between 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.039
 they then separate slightly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.690
 and thus create your wolves long there 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.020
 more space through which said tabs, and 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.020
 goes again 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 it's saxophone is completely 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.479
 dismantled all clearances are there 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 as good as possible 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.920
 The next step is that all show holes 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.920
 are flat from the top 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.159
 an instrument is made of brass and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.050
 which is going through the years 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.400
 turn green that needs to be resolved 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.560
 be in a bath 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.010
 there is a special bathtub for making that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.390
 copper oxidation it green and dissolves and 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.600
 so that it is completely clean again 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.600
 to become 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080
 the saxophone has been in the bath and we 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.979
 Well there you go with high pressure spray 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.979
 blow off 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 the worst damage 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.440
 cases have since been removed from the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.599
 kitchen are pushed up and now that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 ready then we go the saxophone 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.440
 brush completely 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.500
 I am now the posters from the valve to it 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.629
 pick the polish city so its the brown 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 songs that are in the valves 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.330
 can sit and actually zargar 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.330
 for sealing the holes 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.740
 after the posts are out of the valves 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 pulled the saw to a valve 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.550
 to brush before 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.390
 the polish is now in the valves 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.609
 the new posters and we are now going to the flap 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.129
 and with new corks the old ones 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.670
 handcart which scales off and they become 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.670
 replaced with new ones 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.070
 the kitchen now also selects itself 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.130
 we are all going back to the Saxons now 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.690
 Reassemble shape 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.950
 the valves that all turn on 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.690
 steel rushes 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.420
 wherein these axles are provided with 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.800
 a thin oil 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.200
 the closure of the valves that we go 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.870
 just check with this 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.600
 fluorescent lamp your little one lumpy what in that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.030
 had a saxophone and so it seems 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.430
 inside is action for light you can 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.680
 view the outside of the instrument 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.490
 whether you also have mild bronx pulse diseases 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.410
 genes correcting the valves 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.750
 we do that with a homemade one 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.180
 put the spoons behind the wrist 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.690
 this way you can run out of the valve 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.690
 pushing place 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.080
 the neck is after placing the neck 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.970
 cork and the new octave valve ready and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.490
 this is actually the whole 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.500
 saxophone in itself and very reduced 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.450
 ready to be tested in it 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.700
 instrument of course tuned 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.700
 and whether all notes appeal well 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.770
 hey 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.770
 Hey 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.969
 but 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.959
 but 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.959
 hey 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.870
 and 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.400
 Hey 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.400
 No
