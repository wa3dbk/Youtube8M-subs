00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.759
 Trust becomes the people and today I show 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.150
 my microsoft a wlan line 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.299
 can build is a wireless lines 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.919
 minecraft does not work then 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.490
 thinks I thought so too but it did 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.630
 is possible 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.480
 maybe that's not what you think 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.539
 but I'll just show it to you 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 You can see this door is closed 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.070
 I'll watch it and open up 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.240
 look at it she looks at it 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.910
 she stays on her she goes again 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.700
 how does it work? 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.470
 I will show you now 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.650
 Me again, and that's what it is 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.870
 principle looks a bit complicated now 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.720
 maybe it's not like me 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.240
 Show yourself the first place now 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.400
 that is just such a circuit of 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.780
 the line is always very fast 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.950
 moves and makes thereby again 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.040
 These slopes are always very fast 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.170
 up and back down you look at the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 slopes on it are very quiet bars and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.090
 A boat lays on it and that exactly 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.159
 because the boat light is long 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.040
 but a little further is that 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.560
 half on this journey were written on it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.600
 and theoretically it drives halfway to this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
 printing plate on it but it touches the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.370
 pressure plate not because of this all because 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 this iron rod the boat again and again 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.330
 high presses 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.650
 and now there is a trick around this 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.229
 to lift so that the boat the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.659
 Pressure plate touched and has all 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.520
 just by building something and this 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.120
 Looks like it looks like the boat 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.890
 is now on the pressure plate on it 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.600
 and he watches the line suns me again 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.180
 away now the boot goes up yes 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.520
 the principle is just that if you do 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.150
 on this corner of this details here 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.379
 look on it so that's a threesome 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.139
 Be there now and when I wake up 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.180
 a corner on it will look here then 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.800
 a ridge and permeable and the boat 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.880
 goes through the edge as 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.630
 they are not there and so brittle and burst 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.190
 if I do not look it is 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.340
 do not stay open and push that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.970
 boot up again and again I show it 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.520
 so now the line is lit and now 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.280
 is no longer about the same principle 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.500
 then here I just look up 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 These bars on it and the door opens 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.720
 and I look away again then the leaves 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.190
 door again so be here because this line 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.810
 but is the pressure plate is the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.450
 off and leads to the door 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.150
 So it's easy I'll show you 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.150
 Now just as fast as you can 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.150
 replicate this one here 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:07.210
 and here you do it that way you need it 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:13.230
 One of the tracks here makes one 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.230
 lead this long leads a repeater 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.420
 Sorry , I have blocked myself 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:28.900
 yes, of course, it's such a repeater 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.640
 here a button and so that leads now 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.030
 on this runway 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.080
 I only need one more switch 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.670
 if I had the order you can see it here 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.770
 If I have that, all you need is this one 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:50.830
 then lead the hill where that 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.890
 Being banned afterwards will strengthen that 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.890
 now 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:10.760
 now that's the other way sack and 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.760
 the board here now holds the line yes 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.430
 why the line knows me now 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.489
 not at the moment 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.470
 oh yes the boat is on clear as well 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.510
 You can now see the line from third 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.980
 So again guide how the 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.980
 Ausleitung instruction from so if you 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.780
 It looks like both are running 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.820
 at the same time, that's two here 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.040
 has lattice and then has one time 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 can steer 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.290
 I hope I could help you 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.470
 and now you can develop new ideas 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.100
 build new things minecraft 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.310
 and yes, if you have built something you 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.780
 unbelievably great place can you me 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.729
 Send me a link I will get that 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.770
 I do not know what 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.160
 I want to do everything with it 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.250
 in your ideas just write me 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.250
 and have fun bye bye
