00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
promised I won and prompts too but in

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.100 
promised I won and prompts too but in
two<00:02:12.770> nights<00:02:12.920> tonight<00:02:13.460> now<00:02:14.150> that's<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.690> very

long flight to Australia even from

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.050 
long flight to Australia even from
Germany<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.680> travel<00:02:19.310> fatigue<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.850> big

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
Germany is is travel fatigue a big

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.750 
Germany is is travel fatigue a big
problem<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.540> came<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.020> from<00:02:21.200> Germany

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
problem you came here from Germany

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.310 
problem you came here from Germany
yes<00:02:22.790> Gela<00:02:23.180> fatigue<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.750> be<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.959> problem<00:02:24.490> but<00:02:26.320> at

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
yes Gela fatigue can be a problem but at

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.640 
yes Gela fatigue can be a problem but at
least<00:02:27.850> westbound<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.000> better<00:02:29.209> than<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.780> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
least westbound is better than is not so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.710 
least westbound is better than is not so
when<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> arrived<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:31.940> not<00:02:32.150> as<00:02:32.300> bad<00:02:32.510> with

when I arrived here it's not as bad with
the<00:02:32.810> chat<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.170> guess<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> other<00:02:34.760> direction

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the chat I guess in the other direction

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.060 
the chat I guess in the other direction

northern<00:02:57.980> Finland<00:02:58.459> which<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.260> from<00:03:00.670> aspect<00:03:01.670> of

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
northern Finland which is from aspect of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.930 
northern Finland which is from aspect of
weather<00:03:02.120> very<00:03:02.799> strange<00:03:03.799> because<00:03:04.220> here<00:03:04.640> we

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
weather very strange because here we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.090 
weather very strange because here we
have<00:03:05.060> about<00:03:05.150> 30<00:03:05.570> degrees<00:03:05.720> plus<00:03:05.959> celcius<00:03:06.830> and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
have about 30 degrees plus celcius and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.220 
have about 30 degrees plus celcius and
there<00:03:07.730> will<00:03:07.970> be<00:03:08.000> about<00:03:08.330> freezing<00:03:08.570> points<00:03:09.019> so

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
there will be about freezing points so

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.009 
there will be about freezing points so
it<00:03:09.470> will<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.830> well<00:03:10.760> from<00:03:11.450> summer<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.870> winter

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
it will be well from summer to winter

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.590 
it will be well from summer to winter
that<00:03:12.980> sounds<00:03:13.310> even<00:03:13.430> harder<00:03:13.940> than<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
that sounds even harder than just the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.130 
that sounds even harder than just the
time<00:03:14.810> lag<00:03:15.220> probably<00:03:16.220> yeah<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:17.299> very<00:03:17.570> careful

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
time lag probably yeah be very careful

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.039 
time lag probably yeah be very careful
here<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.519> problem<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.239> air<00:03:20.420> condition<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
here the problem is the air condition so

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.229 
here the problem is the air condition so
you<00:03:21.080> can't<00:03:21.380> catch<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.680> cold<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.130> there<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:23.000> just

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
you can't catch a cold and there is just

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.120 
you can't catch a cold and there is just
a<00:03:23.450> cold

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
a cold

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.410
