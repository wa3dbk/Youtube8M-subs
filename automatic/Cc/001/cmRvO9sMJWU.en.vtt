00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi guys are grant welcome in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.230
 this new video 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 then today I want to introduce you to a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.050
 master cooler product really a lot 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.480
 Interesting 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.929
 we're talking about the gaming keyboard 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.340
 both for storm krieger 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.449
 meanwhile this keyboard is of type 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.369
 mechanic 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 this means that unlike the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.320
 Membrane keyboard presents a single 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.439
 mechanism under the meal this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 decreases a lot 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 the interval we say between the pressure 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.200
 of the key and the actual answer in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.300
 game but also during use 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.440
 and therefore the keyboard is much more 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 reactive and keyboard also features a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 backlight as you can see 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.460
 which can be configured in different 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 meanwhile, here we are apologizing, 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.620
 fire we have four buttons in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 particular to change the brightness 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:06.270
 in fact keeping the siem button pressed 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.939
 storm and pressing f1 for example we can 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 activate or deactivate the brightness with 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.729
 f2 and f3 we could respectively 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.280
 decrease increase brightness with f4 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 we can change the mode exist 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 different methods for the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.369
 keyboard backlight 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 we can have a backlight 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.979
 a pulsed backlight continues 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.560
 and a backlight only on some 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.810
 specific keys such as 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.720
 w the sd plus a few others selected as 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.990
 for example directional darts 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.159
 in addition, the keyboard has five 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.600
 macro keys macro keys are totally 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 programmable through the utility 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 computer downloadable software e 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.399
 therefore allow the execution of a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.439
 pre-configured specification so 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.119
 quick just through the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.119
 pressing one of these keys 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.830
 the keyboard guarantees a feeling 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:14.980
 really unique and asti are a lot 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.940
 nice to press you immediately notice a 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.769
 improvement even if in my opinion 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 performance in games but also in the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.700
 normal writing 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.269
 however the rates are much more reactive 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.190
 at a small pressure we say that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.670
 they respond very well so you can 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.129
 make very fast movements there 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.599
 backlighting is really a lot 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:41.000
 pleasant with red LEDs anyway 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.140
 the keyboard looks very heavy it seems 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.079
 however also very durable and all 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:53.690
 the perimeter of the device is covered 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.599
 let's say from this black strip while 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.019
 this part of the color interface 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.299
 such as gray in this case 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:09.500
 there is not much more to say than that 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:13.220
 however, in my opinion it is a product that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.959
 can help the gamer however to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.030
 get better in-game results 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.000
 and that in any case can give much 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.889
 many satisfactions having in any case a 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.650
 good design even under the point of 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.599
 aesthetic view and therefore in my opinion if 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.880
 you are passionate you want to improve the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.889
 your gaming experience 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.470
 in short, you should buy a product 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.329
 of the genre does not leave in particular 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.220
 no link in the description for 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.849
 buying the product the average price 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.609
 is around 120 euros you can in all 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.310
 tranquility to search for the product on 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.790
 best retailers like ebay amazon a 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.069
 fill up and whatever else I do there 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.510

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 bye-bye to the next
