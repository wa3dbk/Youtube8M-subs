00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.670
 hi everyone thanks for stopping by my 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.740
 channel welcome today to 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.960
 let's add a cosmetic heading 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.450
 I hope one informative and interesting 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.880
 for you video 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.399
 the fact is that quite recently but if 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.349
 it can be said so together a half two 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.509
 ago I bought myself powder of course 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.360
 I would like to choose something more expensive for 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.189
 smarter but then decided it would be 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.540
 a very rewarding experience not only for me 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.080
 but for you and I bought mineral 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.060
 Evelyn Cosmetics Powder 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.100
 on it today, I'll make you a review 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.550
 the first thing I would like to mention is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.950
 Polish producer most 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.060
 the audience knows the Russian language in and tuba 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.470
 they faced this brand and 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.230
 everyone has his own certain 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.030
 attitude to this or that product that 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.880
 I would like to tell you about this powder 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.310
 full name silver is beauty and 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.280
 total in stock 6 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.290
 shades transparent number twenty 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.070
 which I will do for him now 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 today review 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.460
 there is also a ivory shimmer 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.229
 natural sand and gold like 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.549
 see case looks very even 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.740
 interestingly used two colors black 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.560
 and gold is so concise that I think 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.390
 very well thought out of course very 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.340
 interesting opens here you have to click 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.700
 on the button on this rim 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 to open the powder itself but we have it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 I already opened it so as not to suffer in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.790
 work time so what we see we see 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.159
 powder itself in a beautiful golden abraham in 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.320
 framed enough comfortable mirror 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.950
 although of course I would like her to be 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.460
 for example the entire volume of the lid 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.780
 this is not important with us 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.780
 but hike in this case 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.239
 and as such it is enough to look 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 well compressed and as you can see i already 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.310
 actively and therefore enjoyed us here 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.400
 now these drawings are not visible as 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.900
 Such a color for my light enough 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.340
 skin here as you see on your finger 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.530
 almost invisible and she really 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.540
 almost transparent but it is in that case 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.409
 if you are really typing with your finger 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.319
 before or on when applied with a brush if 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:45.190
 use sponge and use 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.859
 for example, based on some kind of remedy with 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.290
 wet finish for example bibi cream 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.940
 moisturizing before either foundation 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.129
 moisturizing which is not yet fully 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.560
 so wet film is worth it 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.989
 on the face then this powder is very 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.220
 well finally toned face 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.319
 Naturally I immediately say 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.889
 that moment that if there are any 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.109
 birthmarks for example or there do not let 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.450
 god of course some kind of burn marks or 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.980
 something else that's so significant it 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.569
 unprofessional and tinting tools 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.099
 so this powder will not hide even if 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.500
 You will use them as I have already 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.000
 spoke with a tool that has 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.010
 power wet finish in my case with 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.209
 my skin works well with bibi cream 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.919
 from meybellin that is when applying the cream 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.579
 Top puff that comes in the kit 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.709
 they we talk later well applied 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.540
 and normally tones that is even 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.790
 some freckles that me for some reason 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.650
 mean the last time a few years 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.139
 in a row to appear in the spring on the face 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.180
 that is so normal the new this already 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.370
 blush correction all this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.970
 enough for the face to have 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.069
 neatly groomed look and at the same time 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.720
 all sorts of nice than their goal were not so 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.849
 are visible 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.069
 I also make a reservation about problem skin 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.790
 I 'm not sure that with problematic skin 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.229
 there will be powder work well the thing is that 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 starting with the fact that those who struggle with 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.160
 Acne I often use the tool 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.980
 which dries the skin 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.650
 whether this is my problem with the baby itself 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.860
 cream whether this is a problem all the same to me 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.580
 It seems more powder that if you have skin 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.390
 dry or with dry areas possible 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.710
 will be 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.540
 peeling even more visible therefore 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.080
 be prepared for the fact that if all the same 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.260
 happen 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.210
 sometimes even exfoliation 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.380
 insignificant on whom it is 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.020
 the problem will remain 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.930
 especially when using this powder 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.380
 perhaps even more manifest in me 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.100
 such a way was a couple of times already and that 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.500
 wanted to say more 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.780
 like I was all happy and beautiful 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.720
 I like packaging I like 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.350
 I will finish it until the end as they say 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.710
 and she was mineral so sure that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.440
 on mineral waters but in the end 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.580
 It turned out that this powder is not mineral 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.110
 it is mineralized and that is 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.700
 The manufacturer has caught this trend 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.080
 now very fashionable mineral makeup 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.690
 use 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.600
 they took me to add a camera 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.190
 won't focus it just read 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:31.210
 composition they added mineral oil 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:32.800
 cocoa butter and silk is something here and if I 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.710
 I'm not even mistaken 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.890
 yes here bydet silk mineral extract 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.390
 butter cocoa butter everything else everything 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:47.740
 we are talking about titanium dioxide 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:50.140
 magnesium stearate go to hydroxyl 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.200
 some kind of stearate here 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.730
 break the fact is that i'm sure that 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.090
 in mineral powder here such 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:01.300
 stearate of and just like that 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.870
 it must therefore powder it unfortunately it 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.260
 just such a trend 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.720
 product which yes yes mineral here and 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.760
 on the package pef mineral matting 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.560
 compact powder with smoothing 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.210
 effect and in fact she 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.940
 mineralized and so girls 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.150
 be prepared for the money 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.669
 mineral water will not buy like this 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.340
 by the way of packaging 9 grams I do not know who 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.910
 as 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.070
 In general, the mass program is oriented but 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.520
 hike is the average amount of powder to me 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:42.790
 it seems there is more here such here 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:47.030
 I would also like to note that 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.340
 puff that was bundled she 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.900
 not done literally on quality 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.419
 second use only me 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.650
 I tried to delay this puff here 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.690
 under this ribbon she's all with me 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.169
 burst out from itself puff of course well 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.770
 It works it is made of such a type as 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.479
 velvet stitched so incomprehensible 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.020
 i like the way she picks up the powder and 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:14.180
 as she and even gives me a face 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:19.550
 more like to use a powder puff 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:22.340
 what brushes to wear here such 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.700
 A small obzorchik we have but 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.850
 such an interesting product if anyone 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.740
 thinks to take or not think over all the pros and 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.229
 vs 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.889
 before chasing this one here 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:38.150
 the trend is that mineral powder to everyone 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:43.090
 thank you all bye 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.090
