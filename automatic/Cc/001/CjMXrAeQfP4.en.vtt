as sweet ski so we use a wood core in

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.870 
as sweet ski so we use a wood core in
this<00:00:58.410> scheme<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.950> we<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.489> something<00:00:59.760> really

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
this scheme and we do something really

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.760 
this scheme and we do something really
interesting<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.360> well<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.690> route<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
interesting as well we route out the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
interesting as well we route out the
wood<00:01:01.950> core<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> router<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.360> we

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
wood core here with a router and we

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.960 
wood core here with a router and we
stick<00:01:03.720> ABS<00:01:04.170> sidewall<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> gets

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
stick ABS sidewall down here so it gets

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.219 

the<00:02:07.830> amount<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> kjj<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.660> designed<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the amount of a kjj it's designed as a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
the amount of a kjj it's designed as a
big<00:02:10.470> mountain<00:02:10.830> ski<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.430> peace<00:02:11.640> capabilities

big mountain ski with peace capabilities

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.510 
big mountain ski with peace capabilities
and<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.690> performs<00:02:13.170> hanging<00:02:14.130> around<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and it performs hanging around on the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.980 
and it performs hanging around on the
peace<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> end<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> run<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.630> really

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
peace at the end of the run it really

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.350 
peace at the end of the run it really
holds<00:02:16.170> an<00:02:16.350> edge<00:02:16.500> watch<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.400> ice<00:02:17.580> but

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
holds an edge watch out on the ice but

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.060 
holds an edge watch out on the ice but
where<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.990> performs<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.650> off<00:02:19.800> piece

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
where it really performs as off piece

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.400 
where it really performs as off piece
the<00:02:20.340> tips<00:02:20.580> get<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.240> floating<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the tips get it up and floating and the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.200 
the tips get it up and floating and the
towers<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.770> keep<00:02:23.100> kicking<00:02:23.310> back<00:02:23.610> loads<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
towers just keep kicking back loads of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:38.640 
towers just keep kicking back loads of
fun
