00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.990
 in history to see what's up 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.580
 give because between the 4th and all 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.690
 the little clues that leaked out of the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.010
 blogo it's true that it reminded me 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.360
 a lot the universe of buffy so 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.060

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.970
 negative so in fact its masters of the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.230
 all that speaks because it's 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.990
 true that often in the art collection 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.300
 I do not want to read the summary I 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.950

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.300
 I do not know what's going on 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.710
 to speak but as always I hope 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.080
 still be among the people who have 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.970
 overall liked a sequel that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.960
 I was waiting with great impatience for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.900
 has come out anyway for some 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.140
 month already it seems to me the quest for the tiger 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.000
 the volume 2 of hills or editions 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.950
 pocket youth I had loved the first 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.620
 Volume hunger was just raging and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.660
 now I can not wait to read 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.070
 this one the last book I'm going 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.320
 introduce yourself you can not know 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.620
 how honored I am to have it 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.060
 received how much their smug smile that 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.110
 laughed under a face every time 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.380
 I just talk about it because 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.000
 it is a height that I like a lot 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.320
 his first tome had moved a lot 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.850
 it was the biggest blow you 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.430
 can find behind my opinion on 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.490
 his first book in my favorite books 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.610
 as of 2014 but on this suspenseful trait 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.380
 since I received 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.240

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.730

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.800
 it's a sacred pavÃ© I do not hide it from you 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.740
 not he is not written anyway 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.630
 small and it is almost 500 pages 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.580
 I admit that I have a little feverish 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.020
 read this book since the precise moment 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.330
 where destiny center wrong it was really 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.120
 a huge favorite is the only one 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.410
 had deeply touched and bella 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.510
 like every time when we fall back 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.050
 in a new water story of a 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.509
 author 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.000
 even many are afraid of being disappointed but 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.080
 like really does not dive in because 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.150
 that I'm sure that with a smell like 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.009
 that we can not be disappointed and but 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.050
