00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.590

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 lucky to try at 3 you could one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.479
 mode only and to the consolo circuit 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.490
 hilly and after pressure in 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.890
 training where the sprint 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.840
 used a mclaren and however parliaments 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 there were so many ways to play them 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 the one tested is not a darling ie 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 the prater is a modality that prevails 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.799

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.539
 put by other people who were 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.729
 playing the game 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.099
 the bacteria 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.680
 of the circuit in the various sectors therefore a 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.650
 game if very social this was the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.840
 online modes will definitely be 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.879
 other modes 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.810

 so just recent stuff and this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.269

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.000

 this monster called this creature 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 with it could be ordered cnac that is 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.230
