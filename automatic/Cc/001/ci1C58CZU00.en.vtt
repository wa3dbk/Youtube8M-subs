 hello everybody, good morning, good afternoon, good evening. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.639
 today monday and we're going to check out 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.769
 that our part that I left here 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.860
 drying and let's take the test to see 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.680
 if it really keeps running and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.080
 if you approve the customer process did 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.260
 really works or does not beauty hotel 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.670
 From here I'll take her down there and let's go 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.670
 call to see what happens 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.989
 the score on hand let's go guys 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.050
 we are here with our our plate 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.769
 So let's put all the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.820
 components and we'll call to see if it was 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.409
 really be the one to call to prove 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.760
 that ours that the pursuit of the 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.140
 procedure we actually did 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 it works 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.780
 I'll put the processor here 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.310
 I'm going to put some personal here 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.920
 thermal box that does not feel the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 as I've taught in other videos to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 to tell the technique that arises not 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.860
 It's more than that amount I 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.360
 I put it here 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.960
 right now let's put our 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.960
 our course 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.490
 put our right club we 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.030
 connect fan power 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.630
 the body because goals I'm ours 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 RAM memory 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:15.350
 and we will connect the power supply here 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 the main source connector of 24 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.709
 pins 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.620
 we put here as 12 volts 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:37.070
 which get little source forth champion 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 Let's put it is the case of right jean 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.700
 all connected 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.320
 Now let's call let's remember here. 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.800
 using a key to see if it works 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.050
 here a shawl 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.050
 Now let's call it here at power. 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.220
 At least the priest called him right. 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:10.200
 now let's see if he gives video left 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:14.560
 let iraq access this camera here 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.569
 touch of beauty as you can 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.549
 see there is the computer is concerned 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.879
 I closed it as if by accident, it 's like 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.940
 You can see there the cooler is ours. 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.120
 motherboard is spinning from the bottle 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.379
 installed on ok the source attached to the photo 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
 connected to the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.590
 Connected beauty lussac not put in 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.109
 a power plant, nor a keyboard, and here's the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.230
 our whole world and how you can see 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.150
 Good people working there are the same 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.549
 motherboard that we use a motherboard 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.069
 phitronics and an amd processor 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:58.480
 sempron is working well what 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.209
 proves that the procedure 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.669
 that we did villava works without 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.169
 to say that the board is extremely 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:10.150
 clean as if it were a new plate, right? 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.639
 It seems that I will have it seems that I 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.489
 just take this card to the box 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.430
 but as you can see it's the same face 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.000
 here you can see and it 's the same 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.760
 phitronics I've used above average 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.889
 beauty is this 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.510
 so this is personal the second video 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.349
 that I wish I had shown to 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.930
 you 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.169
 I hope you have become convinced of 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.470
 that really the process of washing the 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.940
 Motherboard works by washing with water 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.220
 it works, it's something that needs to be 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.360
 placed here I got this type of 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.479
 procedure 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.400
 you will only do it if you get a 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.740
 extremely dirty motherboard with crust 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.919
 of dirt that is one thing 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.400
 but the first procedure 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.889
 This I already taught in my videos 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.629
 the first procedure to be taken 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.449
 Do you know when you're going to make a 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.969
 preventive maintenance is to have the 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.879
 dust using an anti- state brush and 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.800
 then using that same highlight brush 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:24.129
 it is clean 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.499
 the motherboard with alves the propylene kuÃª 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.520
 That's it already not in my videos that 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:34.840
 Washing the motherboard with water and 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.240
 neutral detergent there is already a measure 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.689
 that you will take when the type so 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.529
 when you realize that the motherboard type 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:47.590
 was given as burned and many of the 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:50.199
 times what happened is that the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.150
 user has a system 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.330
 the user socket was not buried 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.789
 it's your motherboard accumulated 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.310
 much static electricity from there to 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.129
 plate stopped working 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.839
 and this washing process eliminates the 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.569
 accumulation of static electricity in the 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.669
 motherboard then you can do this 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:13.360
 process that as I just showed 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.400
 that will work fine and I do not know if 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.580
 Are you listening but my panela? 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.169
 pressure there just to catch the 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.800
 pressure and I will not be able to 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.379
 continue this video but I want 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.930
 Thank you for watching and I want to 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.729
 ask you to rate the video if you 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.580
 liked grip and liked 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.729
 If you do not like it, you can rest easy. 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.529
 is and tight and I did not like it but if you 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.240
 wants to help us continue this 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.490
 work please 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.339
