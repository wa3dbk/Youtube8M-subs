starts<00:00:03.489> to<00:00:03.639> wobble<00:00:03.939> the<00:00:04.750> harmonic<00:00:05.350> balancer

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
starts to wobble the harmonic balancer

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.670 
starts to wobble the harmonic balancer
so<00:00:05.920> here's<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.550> under<00:00:07.030> view<00:00:07.330> and<00:00:07.560> maybe<00:00:08.560> I

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
so here's the under view and maybe I

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.290 
so here's the under view and maybe I
should<00:00:08.920> have<00:00:09.040> shown<00:00:09.220> you<00:00:09.280> this<00:00:09.580> before<00:00:09.760> I<00:00:10.000> put

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 
should have shown you this before I put

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.230 
should have shown you this before I put
all<00:00:10.420> the<00:00:10.600> stuff<00:00:10.630> back<00:00:11.080> in<00:00:11.350> but<00:00:12.309> this<00:00:12.910> is<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
all the stuff back in but this is the

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.710 
all the stuff back in but this is the
harmonic<00:00:13.599> balancer<00:00:13.840> right<00:00:14.590> here<00:00:14.890> this<00:00:15.880> pulley

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
harmonic balancer right here this pulley

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.800 
harmonic balancer right here this pulley
here<00:00:17.079> okay<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:17.949> there<00:00:18.699> is<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:18.939> bolt<00:00:19.300> in<00:00:19.659> the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
here okay and there is that bolt in the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.229 
here okay and there is that bolt in the
center<00:00:20.169> that<00:00:20.439> I<00:00:20.499> had<00:00:20.679> to<00:00:20.829> get<00:00:20.980> out<00:00:21.159> they<00:00:22.029> have<00:00:22.210> a

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
center that I had to get out they have a

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.779 
center that I had to get out they have a
seal<00:00:22.810> around<00:00:23.140> them<00:00:23.769> here<00:00:24.009> it<00:00:24.099> has<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.460> go<00:00:24.640> made

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
seal around them here it has to go made

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.639 
seal around them here it has to go made
up<00:00:24.909> of<00:00:25.029> two<00:00:25.210> pieces<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.779> outer<00:00:25.989> piece<00:00:26.409> right

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
up of two pieces the outer piece right

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.040 
up of two pieces the outer piece right
here<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.069> the<00:00:27.730> inner<00:00:27.759> piece<00:00:28.269> right<00:00:28.539> here<00:00:28.899> and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
here and the inner piece right here and

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.829 
here and the inner piece right here and
in<00:00:29.619> between<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:30.189> there's<00:00:30.429> a<00:00:30.519> rubber<00:00:31.269> type<00:00:31.630> of

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
in between it there's a rubber type of

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.229 
in between it there's a rubber type of
material<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:32.739> there's<00:00:33.010> their<00:00:33.699> sandwich

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
material that there's their sandwich

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.880 
material that there's their sandwich
together<00:00:34.449> and<00:00:34.809> what<00:00:34.930> happens<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.469> this<00:00:35.590> outer

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
together and what happens is this outer

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.840 
together and what happens is this outer
piece<00:00:36.399> it<00:00:37.390> eventually<00:00:37.809> starts<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.739> come<00:00:39.699> off

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
piece it eventually starts to come off

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.080 
piece it eventually starts to come off
of<00:00:40.449> the<00:00:40.809> center<00:00:41.199> piece<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.739> then<00:00:42.519> it<00:00:42.670> causes

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
of the center piece and then it causes

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.450 
of the center piece and then it causes
that<00:00:43.239> wobbling<00:00:44.019> and<00:00:44.230> it's<00:00:44.649> basically<00:00:45.039> a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
that wobbling and it's basically a

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.729 
that wobbling and it's basically a
ticking<00:00:45.969> time-bomb<00:00:46.329> was<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.140> expression<00:00:47.620> I

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
ticking time-bomb was the expression I

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.029 
ticking time-bomb was the expression I
read<00:00:48.429> online<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.839> had<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.589> be<00:00:50.739> replaced

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
read online so that had to be replaced

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.810 
read online so that had to be replaced
so<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.170> maintenance<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:54.070> hoses<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.609> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
so put the maintenance the hoses and the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.549 
so put the maintenance the hoses and the
belts<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.269> I<00:00:55.329> wanted<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.660> do<00:00:55.870> I<00:00:55.899> figure<00:00:56.199> you

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
belts that I wanted to do I figure you

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.950 
belts that I wanted to do I figure you
know<00:00:56.679> now<00:00:57.399> is<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.699> time<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.239> replace<00:00:58.629> that

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
know now is the time to replace that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
know now is the time to replace that
that<00:00:59.769> bugger<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.589> that's<00:01:02.589> why<00:01:02.710> we<00:01:02.829> took

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
that bugger so that's why we took

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.500 
that bugger so that's why we took
everything<00:01:03.249> off<00:01:03.550> you<00:01:03.850> know<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.120> steering

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
everything off you know the steering

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.720 
everything off you know the steering
wheel<00:01:04.690> column<00:01:04.930> which<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:05.740> held<00:01:05.950> together<00:01:06.100> by<00:01:06.340> a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
wheel column which is held together by a

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.590 
wheel column which is held together by a
couple<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.330> bolts<00:01:07.570> one<00:01:08.410> bolt<00:01:08.680> here<00:01:09.130> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
couple of bolts one bolt here and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.940 
couple of bolts one bolt here and
another<00:01:10.600> one<00:01:10.870> here<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.730> you<00:01:12.850> see<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.950> get

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
another one here and if you see that get

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
another one here and if you see that get
this<00:01:15.160> electrical<00:01:15.960> harness<00:01:16.960> out<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.290> way

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this electrical harness out of the way

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.740 
this electrical harness out of the way
another<00:01:19.090> bolt<00:01:19.330> here<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.840> then<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.390> bolt

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
another bolt here and then this bolt

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.560 
another bolt here and then this bolt
also<00:01:23.080> holds<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:24.010> bracket<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:24.970> holds<00:01:25.030> on

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
also holds on this bracket that holds on

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.310 
also holds on this bracket that holds on
the<00:01:25.930> body<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:27.100> brake<00:01:27.640> controls<00:01:28.180> module<00:01:29.020> thing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the body the brake controls module thing

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.100 
the body the brake controls module thing
up<00:01:29.530> top<00:01:30.070> which<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.090> showed<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.570> here<00:01:31.750> just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
up top which I showed you here just

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.430 
up top which I showed you here just
covered<00:01:32.410> in<00:01:32.560> plastic<00:01:34.080> it's<00:01:35.080> hard<00:01:35.290> to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
covered in plastic it's hard to

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.050 
covered in plastic it's hard to
manipulate<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> camera<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.580> do<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:36.880> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
manipulate the camera and do all this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.260 
manipulate the camera and do all this
but<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:38.470> these<00:01:39.040> are<00:01:39.190> my<00:01:39.310> brake<00:01:39.580> lines<00:01:39.910> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
but here these are my brake lines that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.910 
but here these are my brake lines that
went<00:01:40.450> into<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:40.750> unit<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.140> sits<00:01:41.530> into<00:01:41.710> this

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
went into this unit that sits into this

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.880 
went into this unit that sits into this
cradles<00:01:42.510> basically<00:01:43.510> held<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:43.930> by<00:01:44.140> three<00:01:44.440> bolts

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
cradles basically held on by three bolts

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.370 
cradles basically held on by three bolts
this<00:01:45.490> cradle<00:01:48.690> right<00:01:49.690> here<00:01:50.020> okay

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.890 

there<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:54.530> go<00:01:54.680> there<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.280> here<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.630> it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
there we go there it is here and it's

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.610 
there we go there it is here and it's
held<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.320> by<00:01:58.600> one<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.780> bolts<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.350> that's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
held on by one of the bolts here that's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.050 
held on by one of the bolts here that's
holding<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.990> steering<00:02:02.990> rack<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.060> two

holding on the steering rack and two

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.180 
holding on the steering rack and two
more<00:02:05.270> bolts<00:02:05.630> here<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.020> that's<00:02:06.800> all<00:02:06.920> that's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
more bolts here and that's all that's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.400 
more bolts here and that's all that's
holding<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.670> unit<00:02:08.030> off<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> figure<00:02:09.020> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
holding this unit off so I figure and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.949 
holding this unit off so I figure and
that's<00:02:09.560> easily<00:02:10.070> accessed<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.630> pull

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
that's easily accessed so I just pull

at<00:02:23.300> everything<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.989> can<00:02:24.260> possibly<00:02:24.470> go

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
at everything that can possibly go

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.979 
at everything that can possibly go
around<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.580> car<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.810> took

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
around with this car so I just took

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.770 
around with this car so I just took
everything<00:02:27.290> apart<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
everything apart but this is the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.430 
everything apart but this is the
undercarriage<00:02:31.209> with<00:02:32.209> all<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.810> stuff<00:02:33.170> out

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
undercarriage with all this stuff out

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.580 
undercarriage with all this stuff out
this<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:37.400> made<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.940> lot<00:02:38.180> easier<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.840> get

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
this this it made it a lot easier to get

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.860 
this this it made it a lot easier to get
that<00:02:39.830> bolt<00:02:40.100> off<00:02:40.340> pull<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.150> pulley<00:02:41.480> off<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that bolt off pull that pulley off and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.350 
that bolt off pull that pulley off and
it<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.260> helped<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.650> lot<00:02:45.800> now<00:02:46.180> some<00:02:47.180> guys

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
it really helped a lot now some guys

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
it really helped a lot now some guys
were<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.200> line<00:02:48.470> we're<00:02:48.800> having<00:02:49.489> problems

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
were on the line we're having problems

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.340 
were on the line we're having problems
taking<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.330> thing<00:02:50.510> out<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.840> came<00:02:51.019> out<00:02:51.170> pretty

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
taking this thing out it came out pretty

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.199 
taking this thing out it came out pretty
easy<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:51.920> me<00:02:52.070> one<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.790> things<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.180> should

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
easy for me one of the things you should

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.240 
easy for me one of the things you should
know<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.720> should<00:02:53.989> note<00:02:54.200> though<00:02:54.470> there's<00:02:55.130> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
know I should note though there's a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.350 
know I should note though there's a
bushin<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.940> between<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.890> cradle<00:02:58.370> here<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
bushin in between the cradle here and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.270 
bushin in between the cradle here and
the<00:03:00.140> actual<00:03:00.530> steering<00:03:02.260> column<00:03:03.260> unit<00:03:04.040> thing

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
the actual steering column unit thing

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.090 
the actual steering column unit thing
here<00:03:04.519> there's<00:03:05.269> rubber<00:03:05.630> bushing<00:03:06.079> on<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.829> side

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
here there's rubber bushing on this side

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.860 
here there's rubber bushing on this side
I<00:03:07.130> didn't<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.610> one<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.209> other<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
I didn't have one on the other on the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.160 
I didn't have one on the other on the
other<00:03:09.019> side<00:03:09.320> right<00:03:10.160> here<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.690> there<00:03:11.959> was

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
other side right here but if there was

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.520 
other side right here but if there was
one<00:03:12.440> here<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.110> guys<00:03:15.230> online

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
one here and one of the guys online

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.759 
one here and one of the guys online
mentioned<00:03:16.420> put<00:03:17.420> some<00:03:17.660> grease<00:03:17.989> or<00:03:18.320> some<00:03:18.500> Lube

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
mentioned put some grease or some Lube

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.310 
mentioned put some grease or some Lube
on<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:20.390> was<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.540> good<00:03:20.810> idea<00:03:20.959> because

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
on this and that was a good idea because

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.910 
on this and that was a good idea because
it's<00:03:21.920> slid<00:03:22.280> right<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.519> some<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.450> guys

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
it's slid right out some of the guys

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.990 
it's slid right out some of the guys
pinched<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.190> thing<00:03:25.459> because<00:03:25.760> there's<00:03:25.940> a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
pinched this thing because there's a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.069 
pinched this thing because there's a
metal<00:03:27.100> tube<00:03:28.100> inside<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.090> guides<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:29.750> bolt

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
metal tube inside that guides this bolt

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.930 
metal tube inside that guides this bolt
through<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.799> sometimes<00:03:31.549> when<00:03:31.700> guys<00:03:31.910> are

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
through and sometimes when guys are

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.020 
through and sometimes when guys are
taking<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.570> out<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.049> pinches<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.579> tears

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
taking it out it pinches and and tears

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.690 
taking it out it pinches and and tears
this<00:03:35.329> this<00:03:35.840> little<00:03:36.019> rubber<00:03:36.320> bushing<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
this this little rubber bushing and the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.699 
this this little rubber bushing and the
grease<00:03:38.030> made<00:03:38.690> all<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.140> difference<00:03:39.260> and

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
grease made all the difference and

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.880 
grease made all the difference and
literally<00:03:40.040> once<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.549> pull<00:03:40.820> this<00:03:41.060> bolt<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.890> this

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
literally once I pull this bolt and this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.210 
literally once I pull this bolt and this
bolt<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:45.430> slid<00:03:46.430> right<00:03:46.459> out<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:48.220> after

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
bolt it just slid right out up and after

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.800 
bolt it just slid right out up and after
disconnecting<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.940> two

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
disconnecting the two

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.630 
disconnecting the two
hydraulic<00:03:52.810> lines<00:03:53.080> which<00:03:53.950> I'll<00:03:54.129> probably<00:03:54.340> show

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
hydraulic lines which I'll probably show

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.160 
hydraulic lines which I'll probably show
you<00:03:54.700> later<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.300> can't<00:03:55.540> see<00:03:55.780> them<00:03:55.989> there

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
you later you can't see them there

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.699 
you later you can't see them there
behind<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:57.129> unit<00:03:57.550> here<00:03:58.470> literally<00:03:59.470> just

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
behind this unit here literally just

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.550 
behind this unit here literally just
lift<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.099> whole<00:04:00.250> thing<00:04:00.310> up<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.440> kind<00:04:02.440> of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
lift the whole thing up and kind of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.800 
lift the whole thing up and kind of
pushed<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.569> left<00:04:04.920> took<00:04:05.920> one<00:04:06.220> of

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
pushed it to the the left took one of

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.860 
pushed it to the the left took one of
the<00:04:07.810> tie-rod<00:04:08.080> arms<00:04:09.010> out<00:04:09.420> into<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.510> carriage

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
the tie-rod arms out into the carriage

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.500 
the tie-rod arms out into the carriage
and<00:04:11.019> then<00:04:11.260> pick<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.040> whole<00:04:12.220> thing<00:04:12.250> up<00:04:12.519> through

and then pick the whole thing up through
the<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.810> hood<00:04:14.620> area<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.269> came<00:04:16.479> out<00:04:16.660> real

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the the hood area and that came out real

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.229 
the the hood area and that came out real
easy<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.400> followed<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.880> put<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.120> back

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239

leg<00:04:26.979> in<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.729> then<00:04:27.850> all<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:29.080> way<00:04:29.169> in<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.530> then

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
leg in and then all the way in and then

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.290 
leg in and then all the way in and then
gave<00:04:29.889> me<00:04:29.919> enough<00:04:30.220> room<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.430> push<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.880> up<00:04:31.060> back

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
gave me enough room to push it up back

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.159 
gave me enough room to push it up back
into<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.900> right<00:04:32.530> side<00:04:32.889> so<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:34.169> was

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
into the the right side so that was

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.469 
into the the right side so that was
wasn't<00:04:36.100> as<00:04:36.220> difficult<00:04:36.700> as<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:36.970> thought<00:04:37.240> it

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
wasn't as difficult as I thought it

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:46.050 
wasn't as difficult as I thought it
would<00:04:37.630> be<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:43.300> here<00:04:43.540> we<00:04:43.690> have<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.580> other<00:04:45.760> arm

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
would be and here we have the other arm

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.580 
would be and here we have the other arm
of<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.870> steering<00:04:47.500> column<00:04:48.900> inside<00:04:49.900> here<00:04:50.440> where

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
of the steering column inside here where

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.430 
of the steering column inside here where
the<00:04:50.770> steering<00:04:51.220> column<00:04:51.660> attaches<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:53.229> see

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
the steering column attaches to see

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.050 
the steering column attaches to see
affecting<00:04:54.810> helped<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.110> see<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.530> there

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
affecting helped you to see that there

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.529 
affecting helped you to see that there
probably<00:04:58.060> not<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.419> very<00:04:58.510> good<00:04:58.780> picture<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.400> the

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
probably not a very good picture but the

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.659 
probably not a very good picture but the
hydraulic<00:05:01.539> lines<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:02.110> one<00:05:02.350> here<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.070> there's

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
hydraulic lines is one here and there's

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.210 
hydraulic lines is one here and there's
another<00:05:03.760> one<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.570> left<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.440> those<00:05:06.010> are

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
another one to the left of it those are

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.950 
another one to the left of it those are
the<00:05:06.310> only<00:05:06.430> two<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.030> had<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.450> disconnect

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the only two that I had to disconnect

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.909 
the only two that I had to disconnect
and<00:05:08.229> then<00:05:08.919> inside<00:05:09.510> there's<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.600> little<00:05:10.919> where

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
and then inside there's a little where

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.080 
and then inside there's a little where
the<00:05:12.039> steering<00:05:12.580> column<00:05:13.510> itself<00:05:15.030> comes<00:05:16.030> from

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
the steering column itself comes from

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.240 
the steering column itself comes from
the<00:05:16.240> steering<00:05:16.690> wheel<00:05:16.840> into<00:05:17.289> this<00:05:17.410> unit<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.889> a

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
the steering wheel into this unit is a

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.920 
the steering wheel into this unit is a
bolt<00:05:18.610> right<00:05:18.760> here<00:05:19.500> kind<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.620> like<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.740> u-shape

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
bolt right here kind of like a u-shape

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.370 
bolt right here kind of like a u-shape
type<00:05:22.930> of<00:05:23.139> neck<00:05:23.940> attachment<00:05:24.940> loosen<00:05:25.810> one<00:05:25.840> bolt

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
type of neck attachment loosen one bolt

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.800 
type of neck attachment loosen one bolt
from<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> top<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:28.210> I'll<00:05:28.330> show<00:05:28.539> you<00:05:28.570> here

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
from the top and I'll show you here

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.600 
from the top and I'll show you here
tough<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.990> see<00:05:32.229> let<00:05:32.650> me<00:05:32.740> get<00:05:32.889> some<00:05:33.070> light<00:05:33.340> down

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
tough to see let me get some light down

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:44.180 
tough to see let me get some light down
there<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:39.870> pulling<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:42.900> alternator

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
there and pulling the the alternator

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.070 
there and pulling the the alternator
made<00:05:45.190> all<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.550> difference<00:05:45.810> there's<00:05:46.810> that

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
made all the difference there's that

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.409 
made all the difference there's that
bolt<00:05:47.380> down<00:05:47.770> there<00:05:48.280> now<00:05:48.760> if<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.000> can<00:05:49.150> see<00:05:49.300> it's

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
bolt down there now if you can see it's

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.410 
bolt down there now if you can see it's
right<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:50.789> you<00:05:51.789> know

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
right here you know

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.170 
right here you know
I<00:05:52.480> just<00:05:53.200> pulled<00:05:53.470> that<00:05:53.560> bolt<00:05:53.920> all<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.280> way<00:05:54.880> out

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
I just pulled that bolt all the way out

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.710 
I just pulled that bolt all the way out
and<00:05:55.510> then<00:05:56.380> slid<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:56.920> to<00:05:57.640> the<00:05:57.820> right<00:05:58.390> it<00:05:58.630> just

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
and then slid it to the right it just

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.130 
and then slid it to the right it just
kind<00:05:59.170> of<00:05:59.580> once<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.670> pull<00:06:00.970> that<00:06:01.180> bolt<00:06:01.420> up<00:06:01.660> and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
kind of once you pull that bolt up and

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.430 
kind of once you pull that bolt up and
out<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:03.490> little<00:06:03.670> unit<00:06:04.090> little<00:06:04.480> u-shape<00:06:05.020> unit

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
out that little unit little u-shape unit

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.500 
out that little unit little u-shape unit
like<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:05.860> just<00:06:06.100> kind<00:06:06.340> of<00:06:06.430> slides<00:06:06.940> this<00:06:07.240> way

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
like that just kind of slides this way

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.620 
like that just kind of slides this way
and<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:08.200> freed<00:06:08.470> up<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.740> steering<00:06:09.630> assembly

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
and it freed up the steering assembly

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.990 
and it freed up the steering assembly
and<00:06:10.870> I<00:06:11.380> was<00:06:11.500> able<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> just<00:06:12.040> lift<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.520> right<00:06:12.550> out

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
and I was able to just lift it right out

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.820 
and I was able to just lift it right out
at<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.150> top<00:06:13.420> by<00:06:14.260> myself<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.450> that<00:06:16.450> was<00:06:16.780> a

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
at the top by myself so that was a

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.220 
at the top by myself so that was a
little<00:06:17.830> trick<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.490> I<00:06:18.880> got<00:06:19.120> lucky<00:06:19.450> I<00:06:19.630> guess<00:06:19.750> it

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
little trick that I got lucky I guess it

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.440 
little trick that I got lucky I guess it
just<00:06:20.440> kind<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:20.740> worked<00:06:21.220> out<00:06:21.400> nicely<00:06:22.060> for<00:06:22.420> me

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
just kind of worked out nicely for me

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.690 
just kind of worked out nicely for me
but<00:06:22.720> I've<00:06:22.840> read<00:06:23.320> online<00:06:23.620> some<00:06:24.160> guys<00:06:24.340> had<00:06:24.520> some
