00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.820 
piece off you can go on these four walls
that<00:01:41.980> if<00:01:42.980> these<00:01:43.190> bastards<00:01:43.970> let<00:01:44.390> me<00:01:46.400> off

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.870 

as<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.009> see<00:01:51.189> I'm<00:01:51.280> floating<00:01:51.640> up<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.759> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
as you see I'm floating up to the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.929 
as you see I'm floating up to the
surface<00:01:52.920> dead<00:01:53.920> should<00:01:54.100> retire<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.640> don't<00:01:54.909> think

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
surface dead should retire I don't think

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.810 
surface dead should retire I don't think
actually<00:01:55.210> does<00:01:55.540> anything<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.520> you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
actually does anything and so you

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.999 
actually does anything and so you
basically<00:01:58.000> can<00:01:58.360> flush<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.899> these<00:01:58.990> windows<00:01:59.500> so

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
basically can flush of these windows so

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.539 
basically can flush of these windows so
get<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.520> next<00:02:00.640> screen<00:02:02.009> shoot<00:02:03.009> doesn't<00:02:03.430> do

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
get to the next screen shoot doesn't do

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.370 
get to the next screen shoot doesn't do
anything<00:02:03.939> so<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:04.360> think<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.930> got<00:02:05.049> any<00:02:05.200> weapons

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
anything so I think you got any weapons

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.779 
anything so I think you got any weapons
or<00:02:05.770> anything<00:02:06.659> initial<00:02:07.659> pick<00:02:07.840> some<00:02:08.729> after<00:02:09.729> a

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
or anything initial pick some after a

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.240 
or anything initial pick some after a
bit<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.209> music<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.569> pretty<00:02:10.720> good<00:02:14.250> noise

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
bit the music is pretty good noise

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.150 
bit the music is pretty good noise
spectrum<00:02:16.470> style<00:02:17.470> motion<00:02:17.830> there<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:20.160> continuum

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
spectrum style motion there so continuum

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160 
spectrum style motion there so continuum
I'm<00:02:21.430> not<00:02:21.670> exactly<00:02:22.090> sure<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.720> objective<00:02:23.140> of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
I'm not exactly sure the objective of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.110 
I'm not exactly sure the objective of
this<00:02:23.380> game<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:24.310> honest<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:24.910> done
