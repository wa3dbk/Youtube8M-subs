00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello friends with you pasha interior 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 Now I am engaged in changing parts and want 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.400
 tell you about how to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.969
 press the part to the table with the help of here 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 such here 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.850
 modes well clamps means first thing 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 I want to say that this surface 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.910
 which presses the part itself should 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.849
 be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:33.239
 smooth without nicks if 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:37.590
 fences bars and so neatly 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.940
 all of this we fill we climb if suddenly 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 something appears 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:53.160
 we remove in order to correctly of course 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:58.309
 clamp the part and leave no marks on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 the surface of the part needs to 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.329
 lining which is installed under 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 heel clamp 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.860
 It was a little higher than we press 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 Lining detail is slightly higher than 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.610
 clamping part I repeat once again well 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 tens by 2 to 3 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.580
 no more than half a millimeter no more than sex 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 millimeter because if she 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.890
 above 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.479
 then the clamp will abut 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 spout and on the details will remain 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.520
 trail from the nose if only two 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 dozens then given the fact that the clamp 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.470
 bends under the force of tightening the nut 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.960
 here it turns out exactly it will be 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.549
 snuggle up flat and no trace 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 and will not remain 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.360
 if it is below that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.950
 it will press on the edge and the edge will 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.189
 wrinkle that is also not good 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.689
 accordingly, how does it arise 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.390
 the question is how can this be achieved? 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.290
 details all different go for this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.970
 There are such adjustable 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.900
 butterflies here with the help of this 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.680
 threaded connection can be achieved 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.460
 Means sizes let's say here from 120 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 millimeters like mine here means 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:38.310
 Here in the analysis is a system in disassembled 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.330
 the form here is such a butterfly 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.760
 so it can twist here 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.060
 of such a condition 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.630
 any size can be caught without problems 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 that means that with the help of such butterflies 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.100
 You can pick up the required size and so 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.790
 otherwise I prepared myself already different 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.070
 size and fit your so to speak 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.200
 I have four parks here 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:14.780
 here are butterflies 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:18.150
 adjustable if in help I pinch 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.860
 detail in principle I would be 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.800
 two such clips are enough for 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.930
 coordinate so to say markup and 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.440
 drilling but I will be in the process 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.830
 survived the work so I use 3 more 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.430
 3 clamp to in progress 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.040
 work for me 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.620
 I could change the orientation 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.730
 clamps with such a state means 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.480
 on such 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.670
 but that I would need during a 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.379
 now it means I will press it like this 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.469
 way I think that's probably why this topic 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.799
 I'll take a video thanks for your attention with 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.670
