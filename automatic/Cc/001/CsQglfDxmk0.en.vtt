00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 it serves him as otto von today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.020
 unpacking video of the yes costing slim 2 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.820
 the second generation of wii cooking 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.200
 slim and besides it's probably 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.300
 for that you have been very very 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.349
 many to ask me in test because 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.370
 that this phone actually does everything 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.460
 simply echo the first generation 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.830
 of slim think that had been a best 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.939
 seller at the time at ricoh then 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.930
 today we are of course louis costes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.340
 line two so that's the new 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.930
 generation of which she is necessarily more 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.019
 powerful has been reworked review at 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 updates and it's a mobile that's worth 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 in may 2014 it has just been 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 marketed 99 euros I managed to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.890
 find at 99 euros on a shop 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.989
 web 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 so here is a medium that I 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.770
 am myself procured I got 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.000
 unraveled like a big one and we'll do 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.050
 the owner's turn today we 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 will go around the owner but 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.820
 especially from the box 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 after we're going to look mobile in a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 quick first glimpse but i'm thinking of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 a priori that it is probably the same 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.039
 design that louis crossing slim 1 and we 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 will see what is especially at the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.640
 test I will come back to this notion 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 so the box itself is a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 very classic way at ricoh 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.520
 classic and again and again six months 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.390
 that is to say that now we know 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 the boxes at yes they are 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 different they have a new design 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 either in total plastic or more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 long actually square format a little to the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.310
 htc here so we're on a phone that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 picks up the very classic darling box 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.400
 knows to have the same box that one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 had views on the first slim sing 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.150
 generation so on the front of the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.830
 box we find a visual of the face 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.000
 before the mobile turned on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.229
 some particular information that he 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 has a 4-inch screen that it is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.729
 dual heart 1,3 jr equipped with a system 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.650
 operating 4.2.2 so good already that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.990
 this is the new 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.410
 version what it is equipped with a sensor 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 frontal 1.3 megapixel and in his hall 5 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.290
 megapixel 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.210
 it has a micro sd slot 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.280
 of 32 gia it's double sim wine like 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.440
 every week at think like every 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.010
 week apart from the wax me 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.280
 apparently it 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.160
 good we still find the visual on 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.290
 find the brand some slogans at 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.250
 darty ricoh slim of or that you would have 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.630
 forgot she you're coming you're going 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 buy and back find 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.210
 still aspec but finally good this 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.950
 is neither more nor less than what I 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.180
 have already mentioned to you if it is here that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 the phone we learn that it is h + 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.560
 so he has the project collection 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.790
 more balanced fi hotspot he has 4 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.470
 gigas of ram 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.300
 finally Rome sorry no ram their 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.630
 men + 4 gigas of ram it does not exist 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 again and who the agps gps here then 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.360
 we have the 2 cv of protection here down which 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.290
 you just proves that the box 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.730
 she is brand new 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.190
 what woman was open so we go 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.690
 take a quick cup of hop cut and we 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.500
 will cut protection records into 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.270
 avoiding to cut one's fingers 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.480
 it's still a little better 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.480
 first 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.380
 and here is the second 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.120
 then the box what is it 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.319
 found prohibited the sale and a half more 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.659
 nor less than the motive in the human 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.239
 which is put as usual on a 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.099
 small a small plastic effect velvet 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.170
 good here is good it is to make a small 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.340
 little more mini million more class so 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.239
 the phone is a fool in your little 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.370
 plastic bag 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.579
 it is necessarily endowed it comes from a movie 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.900
 protector to protect its front 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.099
 I pray them in white simply 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.269
 because I know you I am more 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.409
 fan of white phones that 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.760
 black phones really have all that 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.750
 that's it for class 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.510
 but good after that is the tastes and the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.819
 colors it's actually a priori the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.319
 same design as the yes qu sling 6 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.569
 the first generation anthem 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.889
 I do not see too much difference may 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.489
 the connectors may not be at 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.930
 same place 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.930
 well, I'll come back to that when 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.579
 test the sensor back the sensor 5 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.200
 megapixels protected by a little girl 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.720
 and a little plastic film ok good bah 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.370
 so that's the first contact he's 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.659
 classic enough an access threshold nor more 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.639
 no less than the same as the 6 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.169
 hymn 1 it is very well in mass 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.459
 to a 4 inch screen so there is no 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.260
 big thing to say the dimensions are 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.669
 rather compact today I say 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.290
 today because we are good 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.060
 France is more and more accustomed to 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.269
 5 inch phone so a pose case 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.459
 today it seems almost almost 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.629
 reasonable good the phone itself 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.159
 I do not want to dwell on it 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.290
 will come back to this especially during the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.690
 test then in the box and on the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.629
 find then we find this little 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:02.430
 so I mention it we have this famous 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:02.430
 support but who has trouble getting out 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.329
 and if we remove the cradle so 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.940
 what do we do for the inter of the box 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.419
 we find the pedestrian with headphones 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.010
 raw plastic 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.199
 here's a little rebound they are a little 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.840
 reworked there is a small note of 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.579
 design and plastic sas found 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.400
 the beautiful length of cable on 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.419
 find particular micro input here 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.479
 since it's a pedestrian kit with a 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.169
 button on off and we find the theater 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.220
 points 5 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.900
 here is the beautiful length of 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
 cable so that's a good point acquired 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.979
 pedestrians between this guard I would say 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.780
 basic man chip but hey he is at 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.580
 length of 4 cd found 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.139
 usb micro usb cable that allows us to 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.490
 synchronize to charge the phone good 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.420
 he is white too but I think that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.680
 it's independent of the color of the 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.760
 phone the phone would be black I 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.520
 think that all equipment would 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.510
 white as we say it if it's not 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.040
 the case do not hesitate put it in the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.139
 comments if you have yourself already 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.090
 the slim coaching of the adapter 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.680
 classic big sector at yes that he 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.169
 are still six months including with good 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.740
 the usb here a fairly rounded form will beat 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.250
 very classic 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.570
 ok we find the battery bah 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.680
 for once is not packed on 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.720
 will notice something 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.030
 it 's not like that at zip 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.140
 it's a joke the first time I 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.000
 see the accessories that are not delivered 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.470
 in the wise seized so we see quico 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.040
 wanted to save especially on the price 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.540
 of the work force 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.190
 because yes the bags so little is 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.190
 not a machine that liked it is a pti 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.660
 these little hands precisely who takes the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.800
 product finally access either that puts it 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.020
 in a target bag so that must 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.760
 allow to cost less 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.270
 the low battery and the battery of the 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.700
 week os x slim 2 it's a 1600 millan 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.290
 eur pair ok bah no more is not 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.660
 packed and we find some 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.680
 documentation and we do not find 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.870
 others I had you found 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.550
 adapters that allow particular and 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.270
 good to juggle formats or your 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.190
 sim cards 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.479
 if you have a particular nano format 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.490
 that you have an adapter for the 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.020
 put in the right format and same thing if 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.789
 you have a sim card in micro format 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.860
 you may have to put it to the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.080
 mini format greenhouse that here you go 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.340
 either the nano or a microphone and you 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.390
 have both adapters good they are 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.280
 provided with the phone 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.350
 it's a good point we find what 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.760
 else we find the default language 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.130
 from your phone and in English or 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.270
 first start does ask for the 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.000
 collection of location data 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.229
 anonymous appears okay well here's so 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.510
 all that to say that your phone there 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.760
 deliver in English do not be surprised there 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.229
 so we have to put it in French and we 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.310
 has a quick start guide and that 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.020
 it's a good note because all 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.520
 competitors do not do it and ricoh has 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.660
 the habit on the phones 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.800
 entry-level particular to put this 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.020
 quick start guide and
