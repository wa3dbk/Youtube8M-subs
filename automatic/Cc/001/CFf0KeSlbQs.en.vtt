Thank you so much for your support and participation

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.380
Thank you

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.720
Thanks to your support we were able to give away the hoodies to four winners

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.594
Thanks once again

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.980
We can do this!

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.220
Ot ZooNeun Namja a.k.a otzoonam (A Man Who Gives Clothes)

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.760
Today we are giving away...

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.740
this!

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.680
[Stylish Women's Casual Coat]

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.340
This is a coat that is loved by many people

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.600
We are giving this casual coat to you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.320
Let's see...

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.160
First of all we have two colours

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.120
Khaki and Black

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.740
Single size...yes free size

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.260
The most...

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.820
important part of this coat is...

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.600
the English letters at the back

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
This design

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.420
[EMBUSCADE: Ambush in French]

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.300
The design is big and fitting

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.400
The letters are printed in vintage style

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.340
They are very detailed and look good

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.280
As you can see there is an inner wear attached

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.000
You can detach the inner wear during spring season

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.680
You can detach it easily by unbuttoning this part

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.220
As an expert I can feel that...

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.880
the thickness is about five onces

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.220
It is pretty thick

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.300
It has easy buttons

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.900
Also with zipper, you can close it in two ways

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320
If you look at the waist...

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.160
You can have different fitting styles by adjusting this string

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.180
You can loosen it for a simple style

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.580
As you can see several things can be done with this coat

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.680
Quite different from the Khaki colour

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.960
Black looks simple and neat

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.860
I don't know if you know this but..

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.360
Some of the coats' inner wears are attached in an untidy manner

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.840
But for this coat, you can see that the inner wear is very neatly attached

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.515
Very cool coat

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.180
By now you should know that we are very sensitive about pockets

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.580
I think it can fit two packs of cigarettes...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.920
By the way I don't smoke

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
Some of you may want to put some accessories on this part

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.480
I think that would look good too

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.300
This bottom feature may not be interesting

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.080
But once you wear the coat, this feature makes this coat special

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
Very detailed

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.060
Well stitched too

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.000
You just need to iron it well

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.660
Very good

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.340
A proper coat should have a good zipper

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.040
This is just me

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.960
It would look lovely on a model

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.460
Although this is women's cloth...

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.320
I need to try it myself

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.900
This is how the back looks like

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.320
It is not bad at all

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.300
One more thing

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.300
I need to clear this out

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.120
As you've seen I've touched this like I don't care

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.240
I am not giving away this particular piece

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.180
I've even tried this on

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.540
I am not giving you something that I've tried on

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.257
Let me show you the new ones

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.440
So there is no misunderstanding

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.800
Well wrapped and brand new

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.780
Just like you~

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.100
How do I read this?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.540

You need to check back on that day!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.160
Or else...

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.140
It is gone

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.080
[Comment Reading Time]

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.960
"I can take a realistic selfie cos' my body is not average"

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.460
We don't care what kind of body you have

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.380
"I'm in last year of my high school"

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.260
"The host is handsome"

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.560
I am very pleased with this comment

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.229
This is the real world people

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.349
You should know how you play in real world

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.589
"Is the shipping free too?"

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.040
Of course it is

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.580
"My school is far away from my home so I spend most of my pocket money on transportation"

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.280
"As I've got up to high school there is so many books that I need to buy..."

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.020
"My parents..."

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.600
Again this kind of comment

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.840
If you give us this kind of sad comment...

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.200
There are so many sad comments

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.520
They make me want to send the clothes to all of you

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.620
But this is not a depressing show

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.560
otzoonam is a very bright, fun and happy show

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.580
Sorry that I cannot send it to all of you

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.700
But I will try my best!

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.020
Let's brighten up a bit

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.680
This time try to write something good about yourself in the comments

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.700
I know it is cheesy but...

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.020
Just try it for once
