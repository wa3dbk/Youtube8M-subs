that<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> other<00:00:56.940> ones<00:00:57.180> did<00:00:57.390> we'll<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.109> them

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that the other ones did we'll use them

and<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.119> easiest<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and here the easiest way to do this is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
and here the easiest way to do this is
to<00:01:31.500> run<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> pillar<00:01:32.189> closest<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to run to the pillar closest to your
