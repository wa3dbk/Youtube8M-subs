 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.610
 today in this new video I 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.679
 will explain to you how to achieve the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.450
 ios 7.1 jailbreak 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.760
 it is a type jailbreak 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.060
 tethered and that only works 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 on the iphone 4 which I am equipped here 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 to start you connect your iphone 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 4 to your computer with the dock cable 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 usb and then you will open the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 program called geeks our 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.070
 like this so it's a little software 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.300
 that you will be able to download thanks 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 to the links that is in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 description of the video 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 it only works on windows 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 a mac version is not planned so it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 should you use windows for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 this jailbreak you run it and then 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.239
 that's how it looks 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420
 we will be able to start the procedure 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 clicking here on the jailbreak button 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.879
 now you want to have three 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 possible choices so we will have to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.309
 specify agx no what is our model 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.940
 iphone 4 so the iphone 4 gsm the iphone 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.500
 4 cdma or iphone 4 models 8 gigas 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 so I'll let you watch the link 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 once again they are in 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.790
 the description of the video if you do not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560
 do not know your model mine 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 it's the iphone 4 gsm 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.920
 once it's done you see that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.590
 geeks does not tell us we're going to have to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 place our iphone 4 in dfu mode so 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.439
 for that it's very simple you go 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.330
 simultaneously press the buttons 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 home &amp; power for a dozen 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 seconds so you keep good support 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 the 2 7 8 9 10 you release the button 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 power the power button and you 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.020
 keep on my worst home button 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.119
 once again for a little bit more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.950
 almost 10 seconds and once your 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 iphone is in dfu mode as it is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 the case here 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.200
 the screen stays black then that's it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.299
 good we can again click on 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 jailbreak to continue and if you 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.250
 fact is that this message does not appear to 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.049
 panic 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.640
 the program just tells you that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.390
 the java version is not up to date on 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.310
 your computer 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.810
 so installed what you are told before 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.630
 continue it's really important for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.920
 that your jailbreak is going well 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.719
 then you see that the procedure of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.530
 jailbreak starts a small bar of 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.990
 loading we will fill 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.040
 gradually just above you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.960
 indicates what is happening 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.670
 on your device 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.830
 after a while he goes 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.899
 restart so you wait for it 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.670
 do not disconnect especially so it can 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.140
 take a while me to go 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.970
 the faster I accelerated all that in the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 video you wait while it 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.209
 is done and then once the logo 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.620
 itunes and cable appear at 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.080
 the screen we must again place our 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.190
 iphone 4 in dfu mode so exactly 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.959
 as before we press 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.680
 simultaneously on home &amp; buttons 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.780
 power for 10 seconds 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.700
 games can release the power button and 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.290
 continue to hold the home button 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.330
 my iphone again for 10 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.830
 seconds 5 6 7 8 9 10 it's good my 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.300
 iphone 4 is in dfu mode 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.340
 now I have to boot 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.650

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 my iphone model and it's gray screen 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.510
 after a few short seconds to 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.150
 the screen 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.190
 then the white lines will scroll 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 on the black background like this so no 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.310
 panic that's quite normal it's 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.660
 what's called the verbose mode and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.310
 while that's it you do not disconnect 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.910
 and especially not your iphone you 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.579
