these paddles both have a basically a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960 
these paddles both have a basically a
carbon<00:00:22.350> fiber<00:00:22.529> shaft<00:00:23.010> these<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.609> actually

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
carbon fiber shaft these are actually

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
carbon fiber shaft these are actually
both<00:00:24.090> adjustable<00:00:24.660> paddles<00:00:25.050> adjustable

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
both adjustable paddles adjustable

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.769 
both adjustable paddles adjustable
paddles<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> course<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> great<00:00:27.300> benefit

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
paddles of course have a great benefit

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.150 
paddles of course have a great benefit
if<00:00:27.930> you've<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.439> variety<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.099> different

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
if you've got a variety of different

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
if you've got a variety of different
people<00:00:29.609> using<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:30.000> paddle<00:00:30.359> sharing<00:00:30.689> amongst

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
people using your paddle sharing amongst

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.830 
people using your paddle sharing amongst
family<00:00:31.170> members<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.180> course<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> case

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
family members and of course in the case

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.190 
family members and of course in the case
of<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> seagull<00:00:35.340> inflatable<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
of this with the seagull inflatable the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
of this with the seagull inflatable the
this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.530> only<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:38.129> adjustable<00:00:38.579> paddle

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this is not only an adjustable paddle

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.220 
this is not only an adjustable paddle
but<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> actually<00:00:39.210> breaks<00:00:39.540> down<00:00:39.780> into<00:00:39.989> three

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
but it actually breaks down into three

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.990 
but it actually breaks down into three
pieces<00:00:40.440> making<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.160> compact<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.760> very

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pieces making it very compact and very

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
pieces making it very compact and very
transportable<00:00:42.680> most<00:00:43.680> paddles<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> course

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
transportable most paddles of course

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
transportable most paddles of course
they'll<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.170> general<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
they'll do that now in general you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.190 
they'll do that now in general you can
find<00:00:47.820> paddles<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.570> carbon<00:00:48.960> shafts

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
find paddles that have carbon shafts

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
find paddles that have carbon shafts
fiberglass<00:00:49.800> shafts<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> find<00:00:50.910> wood

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
fiberglass shafts you can find wood

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
fiberglass shafts you can find wood
shaft<00:00:51.360> paddles<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.160> we

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
shaft paddles you can see here that we

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.209 
shaft paddles you can see here that we
have<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:54.170> sort<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> plastic<00:00:55.530> composite

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
have one sort of a plastic composite

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
have one sort of a plastic composite
blade<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.570> blade<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
blade and we have one would blade with a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
blade and we have one would blade with a
coating<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> fiberglass<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
coating of fiberglass so it's a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.020 
coating of fiberglass so it's a
combination<00:00:59.609> of<00:01:00.059> wood<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.390> composite<00:01:02.030> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
combination of wood and composite you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.039 
combination of wood and composite you
can<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.329> there<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:03.899> blade

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
can see there are two different blade

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.289 
can see there are two different blade
shapes<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
shapes and you can also i think see that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.170 
shapes and you can also i think see that
one<00:01:06.540> blade<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> longer<00:01:07.320> than<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
one blade is longer than the other and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
one blade is longer than the other and
that<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.390> brings<00:01:09.750> us<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.200> selecting<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that really brings us to selecting a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
that really brings us to selecting a
paddle<00:01:11.549> sighs<00:01:11.869> let's<00:01:12.869> talk<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.290> briefly

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
paddle sighs let's talk just briefly

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190 
paddle sighs let's talk just briefly
about<00:01:13.830> blade<00:01:14.159> size<00:01:14.430> generally<00:01:15.360> speaking<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
about blade size generally speaking a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
about blade size generally speaking a
medium<00:01:17.040> sized<00:01:17.280> blade<00:01:17.640> works<00:01:17.970> best<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.479> both

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
medium sized blade works best for both

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.320 
medium sized blade works best for both
most<00:01:19.110> people<00:01:19.439> over<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> long<00:01:20.040> haul<00:01:20.330> some

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
most people over the long haul some

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
most people over the long haul some
people<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.869> bigger<00:01:22.200> blades<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
people will go for bigger blades for

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.999 
people will go for bigger blades for
surfing<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.970> short<00:01:24.000> distance<00:01:24.750> racing<00:01:25.229> but

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
surfing or for short distance racing but

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
surfing or for short distance racing but
for<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> most<00:01:26.400> part<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.880> medium<00:01:27.180> blade<00:01:27.450> or

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
for the most part of medium blade or

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
for the most part of medium blade or
even<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> smaller<00:01:28.320> side<00:01:28.439> blade<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
even on the smaller side blade is a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
even on the smaller side blade is a
little<00:01:29.280> easier<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> body<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.229> select

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
little easier on the body now to select

paddle size people are most commonly

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
paddle size people are most commonly
told<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> basically<00:01:35.100> hold<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.520> hand<00:01:35.729> up

over the head and bend the wrist over
the<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.680> paddle<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> tell

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the top of paddle but I'm going to tell

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.929 
the top of paddle but I'm going to tell
you<00:01:38.610> why<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.509> way<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.939> when

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you why that's not the way to do it when

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.260 
you why that's not the way to do it when
you<00:01:42.090> select<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.600> paddle<00:01:43.220> sighs<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you select a paddle sighs you have to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.330 
you select a paddle sighs you have to
consider<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> blade<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.860> paddle

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
consider that the blade of the paddle

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
consider that the blade of the paddle
will<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> water<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
will be in the water all the way to the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
will be in the water all the way to the
top<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> plate<00:01:51.530> because<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
top of the plate because of that a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
top of the plate because of that a
different<00:01:54.149> length<00:01:54.479> blade<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.170> create<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
different length blade will create a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
different length blade will create a
different<00:01:55.619> shaft<00:01:56.100> paddle<00:01:56.969> overall<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
different shaft paddle overall so to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.520 
different shaft paddle overall so to
properly<00:01:58.890> sized<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.899> paddle<00:02:01.290> should

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
properly sized these the paddle should

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
properly sized these the paddle should
be<00:02:01.799> i'm<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> set<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.450> paddle<00:02:03.780> down<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
be i'm going to set one paddle down for

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
be i'm going to set one paddle down for
just<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.350> moment<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:05.610> paddle<00:02:06.090> should<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.509> sized

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
just a moment the paddle should be sized

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.410 
just a moment the paddle should be sized
upside<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.789> should<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.090> looking

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
upside down and you should be looking

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
upside down and you should be looking
directly<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> start<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.800> blade<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
directly at the start of the blade that

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.850 
directly at the start of the blade that
takes<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> blade<00:02:12.690> out<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> equation

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
takes the blade out of the equation

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
takes the blade out of the equation
and<00:02:14.040> selects<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> proper<00:02:15.330> length<00:02:15.720> shaft

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and selects the proper length shaft

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
and selects the proper length shaft
because<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> shaft<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.700> what's<00:02:17.880> important

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
because the shaft is what's important

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.730 
because the shaft is what's important
it's<00:02:18.510> from<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> top<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.960> your<00:02:19.140> hand<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's from the top of your hand to the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.290 
it's from the top of your hand to the
water<00:02:19.980> what's<00:02:20.460> under<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.820> water<00:02:21.000> doesn't

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
water what's under the water doesn't

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.720 
water what's under the water doesn't
matter<00:02:21.600> these<00:02:22.440> paddle<00:02:22.950> blades<00:02:23.190> are<00:02:23.370> about<00:02:23.550> two

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
matter these paddle blades are about two

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.730 
matter these paddle blades are about two
inches<00:02:24.000> different<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.110> measured<00:02:25.560> these

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
inches different so if I measured these

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.130 
inches different so if I measured these
in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> traditional<00:02:26.490> way<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:27.600> paddle<00:02:28.020> would

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
in the traditional way this paddle would

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.930 
in the traditional way this paddle would
be<00:02:28.260> too<00:02:28.410> short<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.830> me<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> water<00:02:29.370> because

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
be too short for me on the water because

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
be too short for me on the water because
the<00:02:29.970> blade<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.480> longer<00:02:30.900> therefore<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> shaft

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the blade is longer therefore the shaft

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.070 
the blade is longer therefore the shaft
is<00:02:32.190> shorter<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.750> take<00:02:33.900> into

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
is shorter so you have to take into

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.260 
is shorter so you have to take into
account<00:02:34.440> proper<00:02:35.190> measurement<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.820> paddle

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
account proper measurement of the paddle

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.140 
account proper measurement of the paddle
at<00:02:36.780> being<00:02:37.140> said<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.800> initial<00:02:38.670> measurement

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
at being said that initial measurement

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.840 
at being said that initial measurement
is<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.810> starting<00:02:40.110> guide<00:02:40.520> if<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.760> an

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
is your starting guide if you have an

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.880 
is your starting guide if you have an
adjustable<00:02:42.090> paddle<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.140> vary<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.560> for

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
adjustable paddle you can vary it for

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.260 
adjustable paddle you can vary it for
conditions<00:02:44.340> some<00:02:44.550> people<00:02:44.790> surf<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.240> a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
conditions some people surf with a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.390 
conditions some people surf with a
different<00:02:45.570> length<00:02:45.660> paddle<00:02:46.170> or<00:02:46.440> long-distance

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
different length paddle or long-distance

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.580 
different length paddle or long-distance
race<00:02:48.270> with<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> different<00:02:48.870> length<00:02:48.990> some<00:02:49.320> people

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
race with a different length some people

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
race with a different length some people
use<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.830> same<00:02:50.010> length<00:02:50.220> paddle<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> time

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
use the same length paddle all the time

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.880 
use the same length paddle all the time
so<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> great<00:02:51.989> starting<00:02:52.410> point<00:02:52.620> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
so this is a great starting point and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.070 
so this is a great starting point and
from<00:02:53.310> there<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.730> customize<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:54.870> own

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
from there you can customize to your own

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.420 
from there you can customize to your own
use<00:02:55.260> some<00:02:55.560> people<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.100> preference

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
use some people just have a preference

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.400 
use some people just have a preference
for<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.760> slightly<00:02:57.000> longer<00:02:57.209> paddle<00:02:57.750> some<00:02:58.200> may<00:02:58.350> be

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
for a slightly longer paddle some may be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.979 
for a slightly longer paddle some may be
slightly<00:02:58.770> shorter<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.120> remember<00:03:00.270> it's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
slightly shorter so just remember it's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.620 
slightly shorter so just remember it's
about<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> paddle<00:03:01.890> shaft<00:03:02.160> length<00:03:02.640> not<00:03:03.330> about

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
about the paddle shaft length not about

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.930 
about the paddle shaft length not about
the<00:03:03.810> blade<00:03:04.050> length<00:03:04.489> there's<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.610> lot<00:03:05.640> of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the blade length there's a lot of

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.840 
the blade length there's a lot of
variety<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> blade<00:03:06.720> styles<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.530> shapes<00:03:07.850> most

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
variety of blade styles and shapes most

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.710 
variety of blade styles and shapes most
of<00:03:09.090> them<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:10.260> general<00:03:10.920> similarity<00:03:11.790> summer

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of them have a general similarity summer

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.420 
of them have a general similarity summer
more<00:03:13.260> rounded<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> bottom<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
more rounded on the bottom so I'm a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.130 
more rounded on the bottom so I'm a

some narrower I'm not an advocate of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.240 
some narrower I'm not an advocate of
very<00:03:18.480> wide<00:03:18.720> blades<00:03:19.080> because<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.920> keeps

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
very wide blades because it just keeps

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.770 
very wide blades because it just keeps
the<00:03:20.430> paddle<00:03:20.760> further<00:03:21.000> away<00:03:21.180> from<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.540> board

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the paddle further away from the board

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.020 
the paddle further away from the board
the<00:03:22.260> further<00:03:22.470> away<00:03:22.650> from<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.920> board<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.820> more

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the further away from the board the more

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.520 
the further away from the board the more
it<00:03:24.150> turns<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> don't<00:03:25.019> want<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.350> turn

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it turns you when you don't want to turn
