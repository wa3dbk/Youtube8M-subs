00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.069
 many customers are proud of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.320
 to mount their pool even 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 now I always talk about swimming 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 which does not exceed 4 meters by eight 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.520
 because when we talk about pool of 4 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.109
 meters by 8 it's the liner that's when 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.580
 even large room to bring but 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.670
 otherwise it's still a beam at the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.150
 time so it's not difficult it's a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 work that is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.280
 that is possible and by anything 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 you just have to have a good mayer and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 and especially not 6 because all 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 the pieces are really pre-cut in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.739
 factory there is really nothing steel for the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.559
 editing it's very simple so you have 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 beams in 45 mm thick 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.120
 you see that the beams are grooved 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 and tongues and with a double in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 size one notch over a notch 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.900
 on the sides the beams fit together 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.790
 some in fresh waters 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.760
 building friends wood she 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 fits with a mallet into each 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.119
 others 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.570
 the impoundment is done in two times have 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.330
 filled the pool half 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.430
 on the sides there is embankment for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 to do the counter pressure of the water because 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 that water at a huge pressure against 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 the walls and then we come back to do 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.930
 the second part so that requires a 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 back on site but in the absence of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 time I would say in 48 hours a swimming pool 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.470
 wood can be ride I always speak 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.730
 for pools of less than four 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.260
 meters paris 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.580
 the only small problem that could 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.540
 maybe there is in 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 hydraulics 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 it's PVC piping that has to 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.050
 to be stuck people can ask 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 questions they enjoy a notice of 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 editing that is well detailed well 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 illustrated by small bands 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.040
 drawn and that we show the photo to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.150
 do and the picture perfect year and that that 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 help them a lot 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.960
 unlike a cassette one 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.820
 cassette we watch it on the television 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.890
 at home but it is not close to you 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.170
 at the time of editing and that's 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 important because they have a manual that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 is near the time of the editing I believe 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.930
 that the illustration is important 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.239
 the visual is very important especially 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.340
 for women anyway we are 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.950
 reputed to have a lot of difficulty 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.420
 to see in three dimensions but finally 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 it helps me a lot I like 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.659
 see drawings a small pool in 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.889
 diameter 500 I arrive at the climb alone 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.620
 where you really need arm oil 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.930
 that's for I mean vis and the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.840
 margins but unlike what you 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.840
 think it's a lot of women have here
