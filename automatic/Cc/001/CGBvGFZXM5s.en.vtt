15 years and today we're going to
discuss<00:00:14.519> some<00:00:14.820> different<00:00:15.480> ideas<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
discuss some different ideas to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.179 
discuss some different ideas to
decoupage<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.130> glass<00:00:17.490> jar<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:19.070> let's<00:00:20.070> get

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
decoupage a glass jar so let's get

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.689 
decoupage a glass jar so let's get
started

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
started

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.210 
started
so<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.680> my

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
so for this we're going to use my

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.240 
so for this we're going to use my
favorite<00:00:23.490> Collin<00:00:24.359> mason<00:00:24.689> jar<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:26.039> couple

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
favorite Collin mason jar and a couple

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.279 
favorite Collin mason jar and a couple
pictures<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.760> astronauts<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.170> see

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
pictures some astronauts and you can see

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
pictures some astronauts and you can see
here<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.250> water<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.390> some

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
here we have some water with some

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
here we have some water with some
Elmer's<00:00:30.960> glue<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.130> got<00:00:32.279> some

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
Elmer's glue in it and I got some

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.530 
Elmer's glue in it and I got some
Elmer's<00:00:32.640> glue<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.329> show<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
Elmer's glue right there to show you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
Elmer's glue right there to show you
just<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.170> visual<00:00:34.410> representation

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
just so you have a visual representation

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.030 
just so you have a visual representation
but<00:00:35.940> basically<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
but basically all we're going to do is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
but basically all we're going to do is
mix<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> Elmer's<00:00:38.910> glue<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.660> bit

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
mix the Elmer's glue in a little bit

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.880 
mix the Elmer's glue in a little bit
with<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> nice

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
with the water we want to get it nice

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.209 
with the water we want to get it nice
and<00:00:41.129> diluted<00:00:42.620> there<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> might<00:00:44.190> even

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and diluted there you go this might even

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.310 
and diluted there you go this might even
be<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.760> too<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:44.969> water<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.140> should

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
be a little too much water but it should

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.569 
be a little too much water but it should
be<00:00:46.350> okay<00:00:47.570> because<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:50.039> thin

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be okay because we want just a very thin

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.240 
be okay because we want just a very thin
sort<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> see-through<00:00:52.140> consistency<00:00:52.920> actually

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sort of see-through consistency actually

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
sort of see-through consistency actually
this<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.670> will<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.379> kind

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this little this will be just right kind

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
this little this will be just right kind
of<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.649> runny<00:00:55.980> eggs<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.910> looks

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of looks like runny eggs kind of looks

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
of looks like runny eggs kind of looks
like<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> probably<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.109> cook<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like you probably should cook it for a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.959 
like you probably should cook it for a
little<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:58.920> longer<00:00:59.129> before<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.609> eat<00:00:59.789> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
little bit longer before you eat it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
little bit longer before you eat it
or<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.170> accidentally<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:02.430> making<00:01:02.820> some

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
or if you accidentally we're making some

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
or if you accidentally we're making some
hard-boiled<00:01:03.270> eggs<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> took<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.559> too

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
hard-boiled eggs and you took it out too

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
hard-boiled eggs and you took it out too
soon<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> were<00:01:05.820> cracking<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> shell

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
soon and you were cracking the shell

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
soon and you were cracking the shell
this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> might<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> can

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this is what you might get but you can

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
this is what you might get but you can
see<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.479> I've<00:01:10.080> gotten<00:01:10.290> rid<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.500> most<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
see here I've gotten rid of most of the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
see here I've gotten rid of most of the
most<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> thicker<00:01:12.750> anomaly's<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
most of the the thicker anomaly's and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.890 
most of the the thicker anomaly's and
we've<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.700> diluted<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> over<00:01:15.810> as

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
we've just really diluted that over as

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300 
we've just really diluted that over as
glue<00:01:16.080> alright<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.040> we're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
glue alright so now what we're going to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.350 
glue alright so now what we're going to
do<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.150> our

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
on the Colin mason jar and you just want

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.649 
on the Colin mason jar and you just want
to<00:01:22.439> paint<00:01:22.619> over<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.400> be

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
to paint over them this is going to be

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.800 
to paint over them this is going to be
pretty<00:01:27.659> much<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> want

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to give them some time to dry but the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
to give them some time to dry but the
good<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.340> Elmer's<00:01:32.820> glue<00:01:33.000> oops<00:01:33.479> hold

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
good thing about Elmer's glue oops hold

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
good thing about Elmer's glue oops hold
them<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.680> good<00:01:35.310> thing<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:35.579> Elmer's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
them on there good thing about Elmer's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.060 
them on there good thing about Elmer's
glue<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.540> basic<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> dries<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:38.600> nice<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
glue is it's basic it dries a nice and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.929 
glue is it's basic it dries a nice and
transparent<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:43.009> make<00:01:44.009> sure<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.610> put

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
transparent so make sure you put put

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
transparent so make sure you put put
enough<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> do

enough on there and you might have to do
two<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.890> three<00:01:46.920> layers<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.520> fine<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
two or three layers that's fine as you

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.240 
two or three layers that's fine as you
cover<00:01:50.250> him<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.780> Elmer's<00:01:52.110> glue<00:01:52.320> he's<00:01:52.950> going

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to stick to the jar because the paper is

going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.159> wet<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> it'll<00:01:57.240> stick<00:01:57.450> nicely

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
going to get wet and it'll stick nicely

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.889

and conform itself to the jar and then
when<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> dries<00:02:01.409> it'll<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> transparent<00:02:02.880> and

nice<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.530> soaking<00:02:29.250> wet<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.630> Elmer's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
nice and soaking wet with the Elmer's

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.110 
nice and soaking wet with the Elmer's
glue<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> sticks<00:02:31.920> against<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.850> jar

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
glue so that it sticks against the jar

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.980 
glue so that it sticks against the jar
this<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.320> messy<00:02:34.800> craft<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
this is a really messy craft as well so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.050 
this is a really messy craft as well so
make<00:02:37.620> sure<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.100> some<00:02:38.850> cleanup

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
make sure you have some cleanup

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.700 
make sure you have some cleanup
fortunately<00:02:39.630> Elmer's<00:02:39.990> glue<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.410> washes

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
fortunately Elmer's glue just washes

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.260 
fortunately Elmer's glue just washes
right<00:02:40.860> off<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.460> like<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.880> use<00:02:42.000> Krazy

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
right off it's not like if you use Krazy

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.520 
right off it's not like if you use Krazy
Glue<00:02:42.540> where<00:02:42.780> you'd<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:43.020> sticking<00:02:43.320> everything
