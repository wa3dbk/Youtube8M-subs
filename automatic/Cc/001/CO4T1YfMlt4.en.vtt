00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
the varial flip that is definitely a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.550 
the varial flip that is definitely a
very<00:01:57.670> good<00:01:58.270> midway<00:01:58.750> point<00:01:59.049> between<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
very good midway point between the

guys have been asking me like what the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.680 
guys have been asking me like what the
sequence<00:02:04.780> would<00:02:04.960> be<00:02:05.200> after<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.860> kickflip<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.700> I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
sequence would be after a kickflip and I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.660 
sequence would be after a kickflip and I
am<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.619> make<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.830> full<00:02:09.159> length<00:02:09.399> video

front foot or at least it seems that you
know<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.690> because<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.050> know<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:46.099> your

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
know that because you know that your

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.840 
know that because you know that your

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
board is landing upside down so you can

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.210 
board is landing upside down so you can
kind<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.120> break<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.569> all<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.739> tricks<00:02:52.010> down

kind of break the all the tricks down

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.220 
kind of break the all the tricks down
into<00:02:52.459> their<00:02:52.610> different<00:02:53.180> little<00:02:53.600> pieces<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
into their different little pieces and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.590 
into their different little pieces and

got it it is Zac eek flip part with zip

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.479 
got it it is Zac eek flip part with zip
front<00:03:11.360> foot<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.349> that<00:03:12.560> flick<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.250> your

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
front foot it is that flick of your

front foot it is that flick of your
front<00:03:13.730> foot<00:03:13.849> so<00:03:14.360> now<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.540> know<00:03:14.840> well<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.459> have

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
front foot so now you know well you have

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.940 
front foot so now you know well you have
to<00:03:16.730> increase<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.480> flick<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:18.590> could<00:03:18.799> increase

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
to increase the flick you could increase

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.280 
to increase the flick you could increase
the<00:03:19.190> flick<00:03:19.579> by<00:03:19.850> changing<00:03:20.540> your<00:03:20.570> foot<00:03:20.900> position

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the flick by changing your foot position

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.170 
the flick by changing your foot position
on<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.530> board<00:03:21.739> or<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.489> could<00:03:22.700> increase<00:03:23.000> your

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
on the board or you could increase your

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.900 
on the board or you could increase your
flick<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.780> by<00:03:24.070> purposely<00:03:25.070> flicking<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.700> lot

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
flick just by purposely flicking a lot

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.000 
flick just by purposely flicking a lot
harder<00:03:26.209> with<00:03:26.540> your<00:03:26.570> front<00:03:26.989> foot<00:03:27.079> now<00:03:27.950> you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
harder with your front foot now you

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.130 
harder with your front foot now you
can't<00:03:28.430> over<00:03:28.910> flick<00:03:29.209> otherwise<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.900> board's

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
can't over flick otherwise the board's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.349 
can't over flick otherwise the board's
going<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.380> over<00:03:30.650> rotate<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.280> obviously<00:03:32.030> right

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
going to over rotate and obviously right

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.970 
going to over rotate and obviously right
now<00:03:32.420> you're<00:03:32.780> under<00:03:32.959> flicking<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:33.859> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
now you're under flicking because the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.349 
now you're under flicking because the
board<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.280> under<00:03:34.609> rotating<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:36.319> like<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
board is under rotating so just like the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.479 
board is under rotating so just like the
the<00:03:38.359> Bears<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.319> go<00:03:39.470> into<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.769> cabin<00:03:40.130> you

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the Bears that go into the cabin you

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.460 
the Bears that go into the cabin you
need<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.510> right<00:03:41.690> amount<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.890> flick<00:03:43.340> now

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
need just the right amount of flick now

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.710 
need just the right amount of flick now
the<00:03:45.470> best<00:03:45.739> way<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.370> feel<00:03:46.730> like<00:03:46.880> on<00:03:47.090> tre<00:03:47.329> flips<00:03:47.569> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the best way I feel like on tre flips to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.470 
the best way I feel like on tre flips to
learn<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.200> right<00:03:48.410> amount<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.799> flick<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:50.299> do

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
learn the right amount of flick is to do

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.199 
learn the right amount of flick is to do
this<00:03:50.630> right<00:03:50.870> here<00:03:51.170> well<00:03:51.950> I'm<00:03:52.220> kind<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:52.940> what

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
but you get to practice the full flip

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.029 
but you get to practice the full flip
and<00:04:26.390> make<00:04:27.140> sure<00:04:27.169> you're<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.710> get<00:04:27.860> that

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039
