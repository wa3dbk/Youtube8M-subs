fret<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.450> you're<00:03:45.780> basically<00:03:46.110> playing<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.530> G

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709

chord

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.830 

going<00:03:51.140> backward<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:52.430> becomes<00:03:52.849> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.460 

so<00:03:57.590> following<00:03:58.040> me<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.400> far<00:03:58.430> f<00:03:59.269> bar<00:03:59.780> chord<00:04:00.140> top

take<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> next<00:04:51.979> finger<00:04:52.310> put<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.150> your<00:04:53.270> a

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
take the next finger put it on your a

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.710 
take the next finger put it on your a
this<00:04:54.259> fret<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.430> bottom<00:04:55.729> one<00:04:55.880> below<00:04:56.330> it

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.560 

that's<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.500> de<00:05:00.710> power<00:05:01.010> cord<00:05:01.400> much<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.360> same

that's a de power cord much the same

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.070 
that's a de power cord much the same
theory<00:05:03.080> as<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.920> was<00:05:04.070> on<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.310> top<00:05:04.490> string<00:05:05.080> this

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
theory as it was on the top string this

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.080 
theory as it was on the top string this
is<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.230> d

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.030 

we're<00:05:10.690> moving<00:05:10.840> up<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.199> whole-step<00:05:11.440> what<00:05:11.919> would

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
we're moving up a whole-step what would

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.209 
we're moving up a whole-step what would
this<00:05:12.160> be<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.550> would<00:05:12.639> be<00:05:12.699> an<00:05:12.970> e

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:24.270 

d<00:05:19.219> again<00:05:19.879> fifth<00:05:20.569> fret

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.670 

and<00:05:25.280> then<00:05:25.880> on<00:05:26.000> your<00:05:26.120> third<00:05:26.360> fret<00:05:26.690> it's<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:27.050> sea

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.080 

strangely<00:05:31.680> enough<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:32.250> not<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.550> whole<00:05:32.789> step

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
strangely enough it's not a whole step

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.980 
strangely enough it's not a whole step
to<00:05:33.300> get<00:05:33.449> to<00:05:33.569> be<00:05:33.720> it's<00:05:34.020> only<00:05:34.229> a<00:05:34.319> half<00:05:34.560> step

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.950 

now<00:05:41.590> as<00:05:41.740> far<00:05:41.920> as<00:05:42.040> soloing<00:05:42.640> what<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.150> goes<00:05:43.420> i'm

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
now as far as soloing what this goes i'm

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.060 
now as far as soloing what this goes i'm
going<00:05:44.170> to<00:05:44.260> show<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.620> minor<00:05:44.830> pentatonic

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
going to show you the minor pentatonic

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
going to show you the minor pentatonic
scale<00:05:46.230> we'll<00:05:47.230> do<00:05:47.380> it<00:05:47.410> in<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.920> so<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.850> groove

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
scale we'll do it in a so you can groove

00:05:49.090 --> 00:06:03.250 
scale we'll do it in a so you can groove
along<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.570> Led<00:05:49.720> Zeppelin's<00:05:50.170> rock<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.650> roll

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:13.430 

now<00:06:03.920> we're<00:06:04.040> going<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.220> play<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.490> real<00:06:04.610> slow

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.679 

you

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:24.630 

Oh

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.440 

so<00:06:25.640> when<00:06:26.480> the<00:06:26.570> cats<00:06:26.930> playing<00:06:27.260> rhythm<00:06:27.710> in<00:06:28.450> rock

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
so when the cats playing rhythm in rock

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.230 
so when the cats playing rhythm in rock
and<00:06:29.480> roll

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.800 

in<00:06:33.810> a<00:06:34.199> you<00:06:34.830> do<00:06:35.039> that<00:06:35.310> over<00:06:35.880> top<00:06:36.090> of<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.419> well<00:06:36.690> you

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
in a you do that over top of it well you

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.740 
in a you do that over top of it well you
don't<00:06:36.930> go<00:06:37.169> like<00:06:37.319> this

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.990 

but<00:06:41.350> you<00:06:41.470> utilize<00:06:41.950> those<00:06:42.220> notes<00:06:42.490> and<00:06:42.760> you<00:06:42.850> may

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
but you utilize those notes and you may

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.640 
but you utilize those notes and you may
clicks<00:06:43.300> but<00:06:43.570> that's<00:06:43.720> another<00:06:43.990> lesson<00:06:44.230> all

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
clicks but that's another lesson all

clicks but that's another lesson all
together<00:06:45.160> but<00:06:45.700> I'll<00:06:45.850> basically<00:06:46.420> give<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:46.720> a

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
together but I'll basically give you a

00:06:46.750 --> 00:07:01.310 
together but I'll basically give you a
rough<00:06:46.960> idea

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320 

that's<00:07:01.860> all<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.130> gnarly<00:07:02.550> stuff<00:07:02.610> that<00:07:03.060> you<00:07:03.150> can

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
that's all the gnarly stuff that you can

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330 
that's all the gnarly stuff that you can
do<00:07:03.480> in<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.870> key<00:07:04.050> of<00:07:04.080> a<00:07:04.500> and<00:07:04.920> then<00:07:05.010> there's<00:07:05.190> a

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
do in the key of a and then there's a

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.950 
do in the key of a and then there's a
major<00:07:05.610> but<00:07:05.880> that's<00:07:06.030> a<00:07:06.120> whole<00:07:06.270> other<00:07:06.330> lesson

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
major but that's a whole other lesson
