00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 Torres Cata is 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 finally is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 different 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 she dissects 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 Dr 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.010
 concrete problem 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.890
 a classic problem from the application influence problem must Tom 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 against a network SAA lists an internet or a real dwarf 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.530
 booming to be transported again 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.020
 to look for the animals and then optimal strategies like me 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 can use often as efficiently as possible 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.300
 Things are relatively well understood but we have now expanded it to one 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.440
 small game between two people or one tries 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.210
 to generate the quickest possible good flow in the network the other 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 tries to prevent 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.250
 so were hindering 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.510
 student project group each six people 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.410
 asked 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.680
 Develop new strategies on how to find a good solution in such a case 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.240
 Can be found 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.150
 proves 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.649
 therefore 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.649
 Tehran Iran 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 Dr 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.769
 but 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.009
 the question 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.739
