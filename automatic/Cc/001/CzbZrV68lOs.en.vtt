00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.769
 hello welcome your name césar garcía i am going high in spanish 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.760
 osorio let's talk about the company and the product 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.279
 the product that we promote here at night 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:14.250
 first of all that goes from welcome Yemeni to all i escoles taraki 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.070
 now I want to start with a question and it is a question who water 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.400
 for example that is the first thing we have to do to be more 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.550
 healthy someone can 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.730
 to write good answer to decide 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.989
 and it is not true that we are now 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.249
 the result of the actions and decisions we had in the past 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.800
 it is true that yes 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.560
 and in the future we will obviously be clear the result of the actions 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.760
 and decisions that the now 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 the one that does 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 and when we have to make that decision 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.450
 right now already yesterday it happened right now we have to take adhesion to be 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 healthier 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.450
 and I heard of people going on a diet but after the days of 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.700
 party after the north 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.480
 of the posadas after Christmas in ecuador 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.729
 but they are going to put 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.850
 they will go on a diet after 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.600
 Today, my cousin's wedding of mitú and we put them on a diet is not true here 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.850
 because to look good for photographers 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.550
 but we make it a palm tree and a formula that expo formosa 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.670
 what is this without your appearance but we think so much about our 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.320
 Health 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.960
 and it's because he or we do not think so much about our health 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.030
 because we have bad habits 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.190
 and we continuously know what hurts us and we keep doing it over and over 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.190
 time and we are aware we must do it is not true 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.080
 for example 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.600
 this addition is a bad habit 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.850
 and there say cigarettes packs smoking stick cancer 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.140
 and people who think they stop smoking 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 of course not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.080
 the prelate do not exercise is bad 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.970
 it's also a bad habit to be lazy is not true 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.480
 If not, but the one that does 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 then we have bad habits 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.820
 now 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.220
 what hinson 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.620
 the founder of our company gained over the understanding of the concept 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.619
 who say Chinese can you with the enemy 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.410
 füle tele 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.540
 but the one that does 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.390
 an old saying we also 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.529
 and I think that's mixed 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.279
 the product of ghana berma lución was explained a little more in the 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:12.869
 coffee 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.359
 and because in the cafe 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.619
 because many people drink coffee you knew what eight out of ten people 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.949
 they consume coffee 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.359
 four out of five are enough is not true 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.659
 maybe if you think that some people will drink their coffee 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.129
 mornings 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.829
 true that you are not going to achieve anything salvador forget to take yourself 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.389
 in this sense alierta more this mine 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.969
 they will forget to take measures to the wife to the husband to the exits of the 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.319
 Havana the heron in charge 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.869
 of not doing it of action drink your coffee 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.629
 and because pos because it's a habit it's a habit to drink coffee 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.969
 now taking vitamins is very good 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.069
 but you knew that if you do not take it up to capital cities, you have not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.329
 had effect 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.749
 island well you what if you do not have notes you consume minerals for the 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.919
 minerals along with the dreaded ones also idle should evaluate the body as 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.379
 they should 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.039
 ishai a vitamin that goes around from one letter to the end 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.189
 true yes 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.449
 now the problem with this mine is 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.579
 that cover everything for example that 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.790
 that synthetic and synthetic vitamin is unfortunately not absorbed 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.949
 for the body 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.949
 you are spending your money is throwing it away 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.329
 and if you want good vitamin D when you are paying for it it is also good 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.779
 -much January because you have to have the cove there all the combinations 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.979
 it is not true 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.469
 we mix it with coffee 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 and we call it a healthy house 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.329
 we do not see that he has weighed double because people did call him healthy tasting 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.409
 the questions begin 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.319
 with what made him healthy 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.239
 has caffeine has sugar 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.309
 it's coffee you start questions 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.829
 now talking about coffee 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.499
 with caffeine bursts is that decaffeinated coffee is a lot more 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.089
 Harmful than coffee with caffeine 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.569
 by the chemicals they use to take it off 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.119
 then preferable to drink coffee with caffeine in that case 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.759
 but not the great advantage that our coffee here has narrated axel 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.029
 by throwing him 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.069
 the lic the gun plain and mix it with the cape is now done that makes 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.499
 a lot better instead of close after civic now it's less than cheap circus 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:21.569
 it's alkaline 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.699
 instead of having very high goat time to regulate goat and it is extraordinary
