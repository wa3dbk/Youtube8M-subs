00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:03.645
-Jingle Bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:05.410
-Shut up!

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.984
-[sighs] Come on, Ian. Hurry up.

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:12.005
-[Ian groans] Saint Patrick's Day is so dumb.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.724
Do Irish people even believe in this stupid leprechaun crap?

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.478
-Okay, I know it sounds little crazy, but all holidays are like that.

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:21.245
Can you imagine how stupid it'd be

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.524
if holidays were actually realistic?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.970
-Ahh! What the hell?!

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.825
I'm f--king stuck! F--king motherf--ker!

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.467
[yelling]

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.137
-Oh, this Easter egg hunt is so cool!

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.088
-I got jellybeans in mine.

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:51.009
-Hey, where do you think these come from, anyway?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.289
-[grunting sound]

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:04.269
Happy Easter! [grunting]

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.108
-[whimpers]

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:07.455
[retches]

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:14.094
-[speaking slowly]: I think the both of our peoples

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:19.620
working together can benefit everyone.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.082
-Why is he talking like that?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.472
-I think he might be mentally challenged.

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:28.397
-That explains the stupid hat.

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:35.738
-Pika! Pika! I got so much candy!

00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:39.079
-Check every piece of candy before you eat it, young man.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.350
You know there might be razor blades in there.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.730
-Come on, Mom. When has anyone ever-- Bleeh!!

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.942
-[slurring]: I wanna make out with someone

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.221
and blame it on being drunk!

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:04.832
-Okay, class.

00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:08.336
Christopher Columbus definitely intended to find America,

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.308
he definitely found America first,

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.352
and he definitely wasn't responsible

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.721
for the savage murder of all the natives.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:20.039
-Good. Good.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.812
-[affectionately]: I love you, my snickernoodle.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.794
-(both) You're so cute.

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:31.866
-(Anthony) I love you. I love you more. -I wuv you.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.282
-So... what'd you get me for Mother's Day, son?

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.852
-[scoffs] You're not my mom.

00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:43.913
-Or am I?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.334
Yeah, that idiot totally bought it.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.544
I'm getting a Father's Day AND a Mother's Day gift this year.

00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:54.573
Yeah! -Life hack!

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.634
-Yeah, I guess that would be pretty dumb.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.802
-Told you.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:01.056
-Well, I'm gonna go pinch some people for not wearing green.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.516
Pinch. [laughs devilishly]

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.574
[hums]

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:06.144
-[Irish accent]: Well, you tell that bitch, Tinkerbell,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.346
she'd better have all me money and in gold, too.

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:11.900
-[thinking]: Oh, my God, leprechauns are real!

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.467
-I had 20 bucks on Notre Dame, the lousy--

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:17.161
-I caught you, leprechaun! Now take me to your gold!

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.554
-Oh, dang it.

00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:20.449
All right, get it there.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.223
-Okay. -Go on.

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:23.709
I'll give you some gold.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:27.006
-(Ian) So where's the gold?

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.723
[unzipping sound] Why are you unzipping that?

00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:30.860
[leprechaun laughing] Oh, my God! No!

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.251
No, please! No! Oh God, it hurts!

00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:36.155
Please stop, it hurts!

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.407
-What's wrong, boy?

00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:40.426
-The gold coins are hurting my hands.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:43.027
-Well, at least you got some free money.

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:45.455
-I certainly did!

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:48.184
-Always trust a man in a big white van

00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:49.479
[ding!]

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.151
-To see bloopers and a scene for April Fools' Day

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.516
and birthday-- is that even a holiday?--

00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:00.574

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.144
-[cheers]

00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:04.326
-Thanks for subscribing!

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:06.788
Now I'm off to go buy a white van.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:11.355
[creepily]: Anyone want some freee goooold?
