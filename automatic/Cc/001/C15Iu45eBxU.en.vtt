first<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.399> you're<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
first go here you're going to see this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
first go here you're going to see this
checked<00:00:57.500> that's<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.890> default<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
checked that's just by default when you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
checked that's just by default when you
you<00:00:59.699> know<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> operating<00:01:00.719> system

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you know first get the operating system

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.529 
you know first get the operating system
or<00:01:01.109> whatever<00:01:02.059> but<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.510> to

or whatever but you're going to want to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
or whatever but you're going to want to
do<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> uncheck<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> you're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> want

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
do is uncheck that you're going to want

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
do is uncheck that you're going to want
to<00:01:05.430> click<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.610> custom<00:01:06.060> size<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.170> you're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to click on custom size and then you're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.990 
to click on custom size and then you're
going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> set<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> initial<00:01:08.640> size

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
going to have to set the initial size

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.590 
going to have to set the initial size
and<00:01:09.240> maximum<00:01:09.630> size<00:01:09.950> for<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> guys<00:01:12.240> who<00:01:12.510> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and maximum size for you guys who are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.499 
and maximum size for you guys who are
not<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:12.930> familiar<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.710> how<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.979> works

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
not very familiar and how this works

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
not very familiar and how this works
roughly<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.780> goes<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> amount<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> RAM

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
roughly it goes by the amount of RAM

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.289 
roughly it goes by the amount of RAM
that<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.759> PC<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.650> say

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
that you have on your PC so let's say

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.460 
that you have on your PC so let's say
you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.600> I'll<00:01:21.780> show<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you know like I'll show you here this is

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
you know like I'll show you here this is
what<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.710> gonna<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.909> goes<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
what you're gonna want to do it goes in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.679 
what you're gonna want to do it goes in
megabytes<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:26.030> what<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> open<00:01:27.420> up

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
megabytes so what you do is you open up

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
megabytes so what you do is you open up
calculator<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.960> example<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.369> 4<00:01:32.640> gigs

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
calculator like for example I got 4 gigs

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.690 
calculator like for example I got 4 gigs
but<00:01:33.360> let's<00:01:33.750> say<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.470> gig<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.490> your

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
but let's say you have one gig so your

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
but let's say you have one gig so your
one<00:01:35.880> gig<00:01:36.150> usually<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.159> 1,001<00:01:38.159> or

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
one gig usually it's like 1,001 or

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.620 
one gig usually it's like 1,001 or
whatever<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.890> times<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
whatever so you go like this times you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.069 
whatever so you go like this times you
know<00:01:42.750> some<00:01:42.930> people<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.290> times<00:01:43.530> 1.5<00:01:44.189> times<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
know some people do times 1.5 times to

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
know some people do times 1.5 times to
just<00:01:46.079> all<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.320> too<00:01:46.530> much<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.700> make

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just all do too much so you know make

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
just all do too much so you know make
sure<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.390> doing<00:01:48.950> let's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
sure you know what you're doing let's
