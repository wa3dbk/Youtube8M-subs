00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.630
 during this video I want to show you and 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.730
 talk to you about what the photos are 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.170
 panoramic for those people who 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 do not know what a photo is 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.460
 panoramic is more or less something like 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.710
 that we have on the screen at this moment 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.840
 regularly you can go to some 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.260
 stage some area where you want 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.630
 take let's say a pretty photograph 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.630
 attractive where encompasses is an angle 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.300
 quite big and in that way place 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.789
 that photo where you want it even what 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 maybe you can do on your profile 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.380
 facebook the way to carry out this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.930
 process is pretty easy I'm 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.050
 using the iphone 5 with the system 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.270
 operative ios 7 the only thing that we're going to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.309
 to do is locate the camera icon 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.750
 as you see it on the top 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.480
 we are going to give you a click 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.800
 when we introduce ourselves 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.140
 directly to the camera in the part of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.050
 down you will have different options 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.690
 regularly the one that is selected 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.989
 by default is where it says photo if you 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.350
 move with what is your finger each of 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.780
 those sections you can get to maybe the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.970
 panoramic which is exactly the last 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.869
 that I have there that says no and what 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.360
 only thing you have to do is 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.970
 technically move your camera from a 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.850
 let's say from the left towards the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.090
 right in order to be able to capture that 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.560
 obviously full photography 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 you have to press the circle of the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.420
 bottom part to start let's say how 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 to record and then only 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.430
 move your phone from left to right 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.500
 as far as you want to stop where 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.170
 you want to automatically stop 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 you press the button below again and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
 at that time you would have your photo 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.530
 panoramic let's see an example 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.390
 let's say in an area outside so that more 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.580
 or less give you an idea of how we 're doing 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.170
 to do and so good in order to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.140
 want to make an example with respect 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.950
 to what I just mentioned in this case 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.869
 I am in a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.210
 I find what is the lake 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.070
 michigan in the city of chicago like 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 you can realize it seems like 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.090
 a sea but technically all that water 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.189
 It's sweet I think this is a good place 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.039
 to be able to take that great photo 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.030
 panoramic that we need 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.599
 Now the first thing that I am going to recommend you 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.540
 is that you find the right position and 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.340
 what you are going to do is how to spin more or 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.739
 less from one side to the other but 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.170
 try to do it firmly to 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.200
 that does not move and in that way your photo 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030
 can look pretty good I 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.950
 I know that at this moment they may not be 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 seeing clearly because of light clarity 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 or I do not know the sun but what I'm going to do 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.000
 then it is to press the button that 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.920
 we have on this side that already 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.410
 I mentioned it a moment ago I'm going to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.470
 position me more or less here squeezed the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.470
 button and I start to move towards the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.629
 and at the end let's say it's over 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.000
 in that position I return to first this 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.909
 middle button for technically 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.920
 stop the scene then what I just 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.370
 to do is only start from a 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.650
 side rotate and end in the next 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.870
 position so that in that way I stay 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.150
 the panoramic photo just like me 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.609
 I need, I hope you really find a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.650
 good place where you can take a very 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.049
 good picture and then what we're going 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.799
 to do is move to what is photoshop 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.090
 but only in case you need 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.920
 cut it out and well having what 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.900
 is the photoshop program any 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.329
 version that you have on hand 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.579
 I repeat this is optionally only 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.040
 in the case that by some situation 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.170
 the photo like it did not look good 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.120
 square and you'll need like that 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.760
 cut it off regularly when you 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.349
 place or connect your phone to what 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.420
 is your computer is going to appear here 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.790
 a drive that equals what is your 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.379
 phone more or less imagine what is 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.650
 as if it were what we have here 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.870
 Browse locate the photos you finish 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.920
 to drink and any of them only 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.380
 you drag 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.020
 inside what is photoshop here 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.180
 we see the panoramic photo in its 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.340
 whole if you press the key it 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.590
 regularly call the tool the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.970
 crop on this side and if I wanted 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.030
 cut it out the only thing you have to do 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.790
 is let's say adjust the one of its edges already 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.889
 then give input when you 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.380
 you do that because obviously it's going to take a 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.600
 completely different appearance and you 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.490
 it's going to be obviously excellent I have 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 on this side another photograph that also 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.870
 take in the same place this photo to me 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.490
 point of view looks very good I think 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.830
 not worth even 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.160
 cut it out because it looks pretty 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.139
 pretty good here we have it and so 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.690
 how can you tell the phone 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.370
 It has a pretty good quality that 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.400
 makes this kind of photos look 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.530
 excellent so I hope more or less you 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.450
 have given an idea of ​​how to create something 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.639
