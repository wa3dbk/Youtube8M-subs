00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
very well with silicone cases sometimes

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
very well with silicone cases sometimes
the<00:00:55.559> edges<00:00:55.920> may<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.129> slightly<00:00:56.640> peeling<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.300> or

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the edges may be slightly peeling off or

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
the edges may be slightly peeling off or
with<00:00:57.960> hard<00:00:58.199> cases<00:00:58.410> may<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.770> part<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.280> too

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
with hard cases may be part of it's too

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.119 
with hard cases may be part of it's too
easy<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.850> take<00:01:00.120> off<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> drop

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
easy to take off when or when you drop

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.399 
easy to take off when or when you drop
it<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.489> flat<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> cases<00:01:03.960> comes

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it just flat out some of the cases comes

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.140 
it just flat out some of the cases comes
off<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> those<00:01:05.100> hardcases<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.909> aren't

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
off and those hardcases really aren't

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
off and those hardcases really aren't
good<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> defender<00:01:07.470> case<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
good but with the defender case you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890 
good but with the defender case you
never<00:01:08.400> feel<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:09.720> come<00:01:09.869> off

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
never feel like any of it will come off

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
never feel like any of it will come off
your<00:01:10.140> phone<00:01:10.350> without<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.010> trying<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> take<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
your phone without you trying to take it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
your phone without you trying to take it
off<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> even<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> try<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.409> off

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
off and even when you try to take off

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.980 
off and even when you try to take off
take<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.509> hard<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
take it off it's actually really hard to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
take it off it's actually really hard to
and<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.220> thing<00:01:17.280> because

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and that's a really good thing because

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
and that's a really good thing because
that<00:01:17.729> means<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.680> hard<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> take

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that means you know it's hard to take

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
that means you know it's hard to take
off<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.640> someone<00:01:21.270> else<00:01:21.390> tries<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> take<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.869> off

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
off if someone else tries to take it off

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.179 
off if someone else tries to take it off
and<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.470> obviously<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.009> harder

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and it's obviously going to be harder

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
and it's obviously going to be harder
for<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.360> also<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.780> ever<00:01:24.869> drop<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
for them but also if you ever drop it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
for them but also if you ever drop it
then<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.619> obviously<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> come

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
then it's obviously not going to come

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
then it's obviously not going to come
off<00:01:26.670> either<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.750> does<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.470> help

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
off either so this does really help

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340 
off either so this does really help
provide<00:01:29.040> maximum<00:01:29.340> protection<00:01:29.930> second<00:01:30.930> how

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
provide maximum protection second how

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
provide maximum protection second how
does<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:32.210> obviously<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.390> you're<00:01:33.509> putting

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
does it look obviously if you're putting

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
does it look obviously if you're putting
an<00:01:33.900> otterbox<00:01:34.259> defender<00:01:34.350> case<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:35.130> mainly

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
an otterbox defender case you're mainly

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
an otterbox defender case you're mainly
doing<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.150> protection<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
doing it for protection not the looks in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
doing it for protection not the looks in
my<00:01:38.159> opinion<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.700> believe<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> defender<00:01:39.329> case

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
my opinion I believe the defender case

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
my opinion I believe the defender case
really<00:01:40.140> doesn't<00:01:40.560> look<00:01:40.740> good<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.189> however

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
really doesn't look good at all however

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
much thickness does this case add that

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.520

may<00:03:27.640> be<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.820> huge<00:03:28.269> concern<00:03:28.510> for<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> lot<00:03:29.320> of

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530

now<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> comparison<00:03:32.709> between<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
now this is a comparison between the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.910 
now this is a comparison between the
iphone<00:03:33.640> 5<00:03:33.880> without<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.540> case<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.049> with<00:03:35.769> the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
case as you can see there's a huge

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.479 
case as you can see there's a huge
difference<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> know<00:03:38.799> like<00:03:38.980> i<00:03:39.100> said<00:03:39.340> if

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
case and you guys may not like this

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.740 
case and you guys may not like this
because<00:05:26.260> of<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:27.160> raised<00:05:27.400> part<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.570> case

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
because of the raised part of the case

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.090 
because of the raised part of the case
around<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.140> screen<00:05:29.350> because<00:05:29.500> it's<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:30.010> know

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
around the screen because it's you know

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.380 
around the screen because it's you know
a<00:05:30.130> little<00:05:30.280> closer<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.910> screen<00:05:31.000> than<00:05:31.300> it

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
a little closer to the screen than it

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.480 
a little closer to the screen than it
should<00:05:31.570> be<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.890> think<00:05:33.250> it's<00:05:33.340> just

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
should be and I think it's just

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.440 
should be and I think it's just
something<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:33.760> have<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:33.910> get<00:05:34.120> used<00:05:34.330> to

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
something you have to get used to

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.909 
something you have to get used to
because<00:05:34.660> when<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.020> try<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.200> press<00:05:35.470> something

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
because when you try to press something

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.340 
because when you try to press something
on<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.910> edges<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.390> the<00:05:37.450> screen<00:05:37.570> your<00:05:37.930> fingers

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
on the edges of the screen your fingers

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.260 
on the edges of the screen your fingers
are<00:05:38.560> going<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.770> hit<00:05:38.919> part<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.340> case<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.820> lot

of<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.419> guys<00:05:40.480> may<00:05:40.720> not<00:05:40.810> like<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:41.440> it's

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
of you guys may not like that but it's

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.520 
of you guys may not like that but it's
kind<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.580> what<00:05:42.970> you<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.540> have<00:05:43.750> if<00:05:44.140> you

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
might have to modify it in order for it

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.680 
might have to modify it in order for it
to<00:06:25.510> fit<00:06:25.810> in<00:06:25.960> but<00:06:25.990> because<00:06:26.770> as<00:06:26.919> you<00:06:27.010> can<00:06:27.040> see

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
to fit in but because as you can see

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.820 
to fit in but because as you can see
when<00:06:28.690> I<00:06:28.720> originally<00:06:28.900> tried<00:06:29.260> to<00:06:29.320> put<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:29.500> in<00:06:29.650> it

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
when I originally tried to put it in it

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.830 
when I originally tried to put it in it
wouldn't<00:06:30.220> fit<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:30.640> I<00:06:31.060> wasn't<00:06:31.450> to<00:06:31.510> get<00:06:31.630> in

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
wouldn't fit and I wasn't to get in

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.360 
wouldn't fit and I wasn't to get in
because<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.590> restrictions<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.190> the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
because the restrictions that the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.340 
because the restrictions that the
otterbox<00:06:33.730> defender<00:06:33.820> case<00:06:34.090> brought<00:06:34.510> me<00:06:34.720> so<00:06:35.320> I

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
otterbox defender case brought me so I

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.080 
otterbox defender case brought me so I
actually<00:06:35.620> had<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:35.919> modify<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.490> auxiliary

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
actually had to modify the auxiliary

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.460 
actually had to modify the auxiliary
cord<00:06:37.360> in<00:06:37.419> order<00:06:37.539> for<00:06:37.690> it<00:06:37.720> to<00:06:37.780> fit<00:06:37.990> so<00:06:38.140> I<00:06:38.169> had<00:06:38.200> to

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
cord in order for it to fit so I had to

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.340 
cord in order for it to fit so I had to
grind

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
grind

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.470 
grind
around<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:40.070> tip<00:06:40.430> of<00:06:40.580> the<00:06:40.700> plug<00:06:40.910> in<00:06:41.090> order<00:06:41.330> for

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
around the tip of the plug in order for

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.420 
around the tip of the plug in order for
it<00:06:41.510> to<00:06:41.600> actually<00:06:41.810> fit<00:06:42.680> in<00:06:42.920> because<00:06:43.070> I<00:06:43.220> didn't

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
it to actually fit in because I didn't

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.280 
it to actually fit in because I didn't
want<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.610> go<00:06:44.060> out<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.330> look<00:06:44.510> for<00:06:44.570> a<00:06:44.780> smaller

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
want to go out and look for a smaller

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.490 
want to go out and look for a smaller
auxiliary<00:06:46.040> cord<00:06:46.280> with<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.490> smaller<00:06:46.790> plug<00:06:47.090> so

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
auxiliary cord with a smaller plug so

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.420 
auxiliary cord with a smaller plug so
you<00:06:48.500> know<00:06:48.590> that's<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.860> problem<00:06:49.070> i<00:06:49.220> have<00:06:49.400> with
