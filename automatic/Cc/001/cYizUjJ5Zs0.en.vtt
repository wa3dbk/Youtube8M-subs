what<00:03:15.209> football<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.230> most<00:03:16.470> difficult

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
what football is the most difficult

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.650

thing<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.040> prepare<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.639> because<00:03:17.970> mentally<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
thing to prepare for because mentally is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.080 
thing to prepare for because mentally is
taxing<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.379> physically<00:03:19.889> as<00:03:19.980> taxing<00:03:20.639> when<00:03:20.970> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
taxing but physically as taxing when it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.550 
taxing but physically as taxing when it
comes<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.419> doing<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.660> announcing<00:03:22.199> work<00:03:22.349> that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
comes to doing the announcing work that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080 
comes to doing the announcing work that
kind<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.859> goes<00:03:23.010> hand<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.340> hand<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.579> football

kind of goes hand in hand with football

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
kind of goes hand in hand with football
that's<00:03:24.299> probably<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.900> thing<00:03:25.109> that's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that's probably the one thing that's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.599 
that's probably the one thing that's
more<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.889> bit<00:03:25.980> more<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.310> mental

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
more a little bit more of a mental

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.849 
more a little bit more of a mental
preparation<00:03:27.299> now<00:03:27.690> acting<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.440> probably

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
preparation now acting is probably

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.649 
preparation now acting is probably
number<00:03:29.129> two<00:03:29.160> because<00:03:29.879> something<00:03:30.269> that's<00:03:30.419> out

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
number two because something that's out

number two because something that's out
of<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.900> realm<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.530> what<00:03:32.069> I'm<00:03:32.310> used<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.879> doing
