00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 spring buds on last year's shoots 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.250
 preserved not only on clematis ah 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.130
 who bloom on the shoots of last year 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 but also on the shoots of the current year for what 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 this is done in order for clematis as 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.390
 you can wake up earlier and start growing 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.720
 otherwise if these buds all dry up and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.060
 the shoots will die and the lands will go somewhere 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.550
 at the end of May in June it is very late and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 when they say that my clematis quota 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 blooms until winter is nothing good in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.390
 this is not because clematis should 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 take and pass some time 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.120
 well, at least 2 weeks before 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 the cold and winter will come that is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.559
 the growing season and here should be 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.800
 long enough and if we don't save 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.370
 shoots on the chain last year 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 shoots 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
 then clematis will be late late 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.510
 will bloom and it is possible that on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.860
 next year it just won't come out 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 so you need to try to save 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.260
 buds on the shoots of last year 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.530
 Clematis of all groups I for this I 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 I do this, so I cut him off at a height 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 somewhere well 70 centimeters there like 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 get the top part mean shoots I 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.430
 I just tore them off then for 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.799
 shelter and the lower part I neatly 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.400
 I cleaned the leaves off. I shot this one. 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.829
 Part neatly so they don't break 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.380
 now i'm wrapping them in a ring 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.009
 down the bone 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.009
 wrap a ring 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.630
 You can cover with any material that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.880
 will not be heavily caked not for example 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.270
 my old velvet rolls that I already cleaned 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 then on top I close a piece of hot water bottles 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.650
 the old 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.950
 lutrasilom or a warmer one that has 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.840
 there's sprinkled on top zemelku 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.670
 a little bit so that the heater does not blow away 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:27.630
 and on top of it all I put this here 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.630
 hat clematis that I cut off I 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.580
 I lay on top so here it is in winter and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.480
 In spring , Iâ€™m removing this hat. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.730
 I leave it all to comfortably then it was 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.520
 in the spring look like this raise a 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 warmer and look like there are kidney themselves 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.790
 feels as soon as they start 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 increase in size 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.380
 choose a day so overcast not frying and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.750
 take off everything and then they here you can be 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.880
 remember here I grew rouge 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.670
 cardinal you were 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.760
 when in June in my opinion yes and he already 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.239
 almost faded from flowers at 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.880
 least now he's ready for 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.800
 next season and so here I am 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.030
 I will watch as the kidneys just begin 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.519
 grow in size 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.000
 I completely remove the shelter insert a couple 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.000
 they are tied up
