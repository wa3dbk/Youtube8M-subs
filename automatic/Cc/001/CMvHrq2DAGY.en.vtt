what<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:01.860> doing<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.159> today<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.669> there's

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
what we're doing here today is there's

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.360 
what we're doing here today is there's
been<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.270> lot<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.570> talk<00:00:04.020> on<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.410> internet<00:00:04.560> about

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
been a lot of talk on the internet about

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430 
been a lot of talk on the internet about
all<00:00:05.790> different<00:00:06.240> detectors<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.049> showing

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
all different detectors and showing

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.379 
all different detectors and showing
their<00:00:07.589> ability<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.220> discriminate<00:00:08.610> junk<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
their ability to discriminate junk and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.600 
their ability to discriminate junk and
still<00:00:09.599> picking<00:00:09.929> up<00:00:10.019> good<00:00:10.200> targets<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.429> what<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
still picking up good targets so what I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.580 
still picking up good targets so what I
thought<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.940> would<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.570> break<00:00:13.019> out<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.410> old

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
thought I would do is break out this old

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
thought I would do is break out this old
detector<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.340> called<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> general<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.719> can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
detector it's called the general you can

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.130 
detector it's called the general you can
see<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.710> radio<00:00:17.279> shack<00:00:17.609> case<00:00:18.140> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
see it's in a little radio shack case it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960 
see it's in a little radio shack case it
was<00:00:19.289> hand-built<00:00:19.710> by<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> friend<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.609> mine<00:00:20.760> about

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
was hand-built by a friend of mine about

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.689 
was hand-built by a friend of mine about
12<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.689> 13<00:00:21.720> years<00:00:22.380> ago<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.010> been<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.460> long

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
12 or 13 years ago and it's been so long

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
12 or 13 years ago and it's been so long
now<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.000> he<00:00:24.269> really<00:00:24.539> can't<00:00:25.109> remember

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now that he really can't remember

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
now that he really can't remember
exactly<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.220> he<00:00:26.310> did<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> pretty

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
exactly what he did but it is a pretty

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
exactly what he did but it is a pretty
impressive<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.560> machine<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.400> whole

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
impressive little machine it has a whole

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.330 
impressive little machine it has a whole
metal<00:00:30.260> TR<00:00:31.260> discrimination<00:00:32.160> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
metal TR discrimination and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.819 
metal TR discrimination and
discrimination<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.230> we're<00:00:34.350> gonna<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
discrimination so what we're gonna do is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
discrimination so what we're gonna do is
put<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> through<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> pace<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
put it through a pace as you can see it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
put it through a pace as you can see it
doesn't<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.079> external<00:00:37.469> speaker<00:00:37.739> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
doesn't have an external speaker so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
doesn't have an external speaker so
we've<00:00:38.700> got<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.239> long<00:00:39.390> guitar<00:00:40.260> amplifier

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
we've got a little long guitar amplifier

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.750 
we've got a little long guitar amplifier
for<00:00:41.420> first<00:00:42.420> test<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:43.079> we're<00:00:43.230> gonna<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.760> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
for first test what we're gonna do to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.410 
for first test what we're gonna do to
knock<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> regular<00:00:45.750> Civil<00:00:46.079> War<00:00:46.260> cut<00:00:46.500> nail<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
knock out a regular Civil War cut nail a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.750 
knock out a regular Civil War cut nail a
I'm<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> close-up<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.350> theory

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.100 

gradually<00:00:53.760> advance<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> discriminator

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gradually advance it a discriminator

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.189 
gradually advance it a discriminator
until<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.559> disappears<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.960> no

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
until that disappears so now we have no

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.730 
until that disappears so now we have no
no<00:00:58.559> signal<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> nail

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
no signal on the nail

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.180 
no signal on the nail
take<00:01:01.370> different<00:01:01.640> targets<00:01:02.300> there's<00:01:02.540> a<00:01:02.660> quarter

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
take different targets there's a quarter

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.050 
take different targets there's a quarter
you<00:01:04.190> see<00:01:04.400> that<00:01:04.580> picks<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:04.970> up<00:01:05.560> one<00:01:06.560> of<00:01:06.650> the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
you see that picks it up one of the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.850 
you see that picks it up one of the
extreme<00:01:08.060> tests<00:01:08.450> for<00:01:08.720> machine<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.350> seems<00:01:09.590> like

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
extreme tests for machine it seems like

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:27.790 
extreme tests for machine it seems like
just<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.160> pick<00:01:10.370> it<00:01:10.520> up<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.970> end<00:01:25.720> after<00:01:26.800> go

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
just to pick it up on the end after go

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.160 
just to pick it up on the end after go
ring<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.850> can<00:01:32.030> see<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:32.930> we're<00:01:33.140> not

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
ring as you can see just so we're not

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.800 
ring as you can see just so we're not
playing<00:01:33.650> any<00:01:33.800> tricks<00:01:33.890> here<00:01:34.400> there's<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.390> nail

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
playing any tricks here there's a nail

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.070 
playing any tricks here there's a nail
completely<00:01:36.590> knocked<00:01:36.830> out<00:01:37.570> now<00:01:38.570> we'll<00:01:38.810> put<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
completely knocked out now we'll put the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:51.580 
completely knocked out now we'll put the
ring<00:01:39.500> under<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.040> nail<00:01:48.790> another<00:01:50.590> another

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
ring under the nail another another

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.060 
ring under the nail another another
extreme<00:01:52.160> test<00:01:52.550> for<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> metal<00:01:53.180> detector

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
extreme test for a metal detector

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.530 
extreme test for a metal detector
usually<00:01:55.070> what<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:55.490> say<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:56.000> if<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.300> negative

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
usually what they say is if a negative

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.050 
usually what they say is if a negative
signal<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.530> larger<00:01:58.040> than<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.280> positive<00:01:58.850> signal

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
signal is larger than a positive signal

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.910 
signal is larger than a positive signal
that<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.510> won't<00:01:59.660> pick<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.900> up<00:02:00.140> well<00:02:00.740> obviously

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that it won't pick it up well obviously

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.280 
that it won't pick it up well obviously
this<00:02:01.580> negative<00:02:02.150> signal<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:02.720> larger<00:02:03.170> than

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
this negative signal is larger than

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.080 
this negative signal is larger than
those<00:02:03.440> positive<00:02:04.100> signals<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.670> let's<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.000> if

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
those positive signals so let's see if

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.999 
those positive signals so let's see if
we<00:02:05.240> can<00:02:05.450> discriminate<00:02:06.170> out<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.860> wrench

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
we can discriminate out this wrench

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.009 
we can discriminate out this wrench
for<00:02:09.640> close-up<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.980> craftsman<00:02:12.750> 7/16<00:02:13.750> you

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
for close-up it's a craftsman 7/16 you

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.059 
for close-up it's a craftsman 7/16 you
hold<00:02:14.200> there<00:02:14.440> dribble<00:02:14.920> Sean<00:02:16.560> made<00:02:17.560> American

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
hold there dribble Sean made American

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.600 
hold there dribble Sean made American
made<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.700> America<00:02:19.120> 17<00:02:19.799> 7/16<00:02:20.799> craftsman<00:02:21.430> in

made in America 17 7/16 craftsman in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.020 
made in America 17 7/16 craftsman in
wrench<00:02:22.319> as<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.459> wrench<00:02:24.819> is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
wrench as you can see this wrench is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.910 
wrench as you can see this wrench is
going<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.269> give<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> little<00:02:25.959> bit<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.230> signal<00:02:26.739> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
going to give a little bit of signal so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to give a little bit of signal so
we're<00:02:27.099> gonna<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.480> dial<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.750> our

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
we're gonna have dial in our

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.699 
we're gonna have dial in our
discriminator<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.700> knock<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.120> out

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.699 

get<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.430> where<00:02:36.579> it'll<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:36.939> an<00:02:37.090> occasional

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
get it where it'll get an occasional

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.170 
get it where it'll get an occasional
maybe<00:02:38.709> an<00:02:38.920> occasional<00:02:39.040> left<00:02:39.849> there<00:02:40.060> it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
maybe an occasional left there it's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:03:00.330 
maybe an occasional left there it's
doing<00:02:40.930> pretty<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:41.730> yes<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.909> going<00:02:59.189> there<00:03:00.189> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
doing pretty well yes I going there you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.550 
doing pretty well yes I going there you
go<00:03:00.549> we<00:03:00.969> can<00:03:01.150> back<00:03:01.299> this<00:03:01.540> off<00:03:01.810> again<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
go we can back this off again just to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.159 
go we can back this off again just to
see<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.950> we're<00:03:03.099> not<00:03:03.310> playing<00:03:04.299> any<00:03:04.450> tricks

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.809 

and<00:03:08.169> we're<00:03:08.379> not<00:03:08.530> actually<00:03:09.099> sitting<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.669> the

let's<00:03:13.480> give<00:03:13.659> this<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.319> give<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.590> a

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
let's give this and just give it a

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.129 
let's give this and just give it a
little<00:03:14.829> test<00:03:15.099> with<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.459> nail<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.150> believe

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
little test with this nail I believe

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.599 
little test with this nail I believe
it'll<00:03:17.319> still<00:03:17.620> pick<00:03:17.889> it<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.129> on<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.459> ground

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
it'll still pick it up on the ground

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.160 
it'll still pick it up on the ground
like<00:03:18.909> that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:38.040

a<00:03:57.250> Radio<00:03:57.580> Shack<00:03:57.640> box<00:03:58.270> will<00:03:58.990> do<00:03:59.140> things<00:03:59.380> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
a Radio Shack box will do things that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.960 
a Radio Shack box will do things that
most<00:03:59.830> of<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.190> machine

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:13.050 

let's<00:04:03.970> try<00:04:04.210> one<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:11.460> this<00:04:12.460> seems<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.910> be<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
let's try one on it this seems to be a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.940 
let's try one on it this seems to be a
very<00:04:13.330> difficult<00:04:15.239> task<00:04:16.239> for<00:04:16.359> most<00:04:16.660> machines

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
very difficult task for most machines

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.630 
very difficult task for most machines
pick<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:17.980> coin<00:04:18.250> up<00:04:18.580> with<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> end

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
pick a coin up with it in the end

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.020 
pick a coin up with it in the end
just<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:22.110> little

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.030 

see<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.150> still<00:04:29.420> picks<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.810> up<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.740> does

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
see it still picks it up so that does

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.830 
see it still picks it up so that does
have<00:04:31.340> an<00:04:31.490> effect<00:04:31.790> on<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.120> but<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.330> still<00:04:32.570> picks

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
have an effect on it but it still picks

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.540 
have an effect on it but it still picks
it<00:04:32.960> up<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.680> there<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:34.010> go

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
it up so there you go

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.240 
it up so there you go
few<00:04:35.540> minutes<00:04:35.690> with<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.140> general<00:04:36.530> custom<00:04:37.070> made

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
few minutes with the general custom made

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.840 
few minutes with the general custom made
detector<00:04:38.620> one<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> kind<00:04:40.070> I'll<00:04:40.640> get<00:04:40.820> a

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
detector one of the kind I'll get a

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.500 
detector one of the kind I'll get a
close-up<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.420> juror<00:04:41.750> okay<00:04:42.080> there<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.800> go

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
close-up of that juror okay there you go

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.350 
close-up of that juror okay there you go
show<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> controls<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.170> little<00:04:45.380> bit<00:04:45.530> yep

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
show the controls a little bit yep

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.200 
show the controls a little bit yep
is<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.600> controls<00:04:48.670> zoom<00:04:49.670> out<00:04:49.820> here<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:50.090> little

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
is it controls zoom out here a little

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.280 
is it controls zoom out here a little
bit<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.030> can<00:04:56.060> see<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:56.570> compatible<00:04:56.990> with

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
bit and you can see it's compatible with

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.930 
bit and you can see it's compatible with
whites<00:04:57.850> coils<00:05:00.040> we<00:05:01.040> did<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.460> because<00:05:01.790> they

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
whites coils we did that because they

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.370 
whites coils we did that because they
are<00:05:02.000> very<00:05:02.150> dependable<00:05:02.750> search<00:05:03.050> schools<00:05:05.380> so

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
are very dependable search schools so

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.840 
are very dependable search schools so
there<00:05:06.530> you<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:07.070> there's<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.310> few<00:05:07.550> minutes

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
there you have it there's a few minutes

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.560 
there you have it there's a few minutes
with<00:05:08.030> Adam<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.660> Jerry<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.169> general
