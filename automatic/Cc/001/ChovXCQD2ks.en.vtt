starter the guy said he tried a new
battery<00:00:45.289> still<00:00:46.289> gets<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.860> problem

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.299 

sounds<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> dead<00:00:52.350> battery<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:52.890> but

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sounds like a dead battery right now but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
sounds like a dead battery right now but
he<00:00:53.370> says<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.760> puts<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> brand<00:00:54.600> new<00:00:54.719> battery

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
he says when he puts a brand new battery

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.860 
he says when he puts a brand new battery
in<00:00:55.079> there<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.530> turns<00:00:55.800> over<00:00:56.070> slowly<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
in there it turns over slowly so I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.029 
in there it turns over slowly so I
started<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> take<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> starter<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
started to take off the starter here and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
started to take off the starter here and
I'll<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.280> happens<00:01:02.789> after<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> there

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I'll see what happens after that there

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
I'll see what happens after that there
was<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:03.960> cover<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.500> took<00:01:04.710> off<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
was a little cover here I took off so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.310 
was a little cover here I took off so
I'm<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.610> off

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
I'm gonna take off

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
I'm gonna take off
hold<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.650> bolt<00:01:08.010> under<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.970> over

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
hold here bolt under there and over

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.410 
hold here bolt under there and over
there<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> cable<00:01:11.430> I'd<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
there and then the cable I'd put the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
there and then the cable I'd put the
starter<00:01:12.750> off<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> motor<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.530> tried<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
starter off the motor I tried it on the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910 
starter off the motor I tried it on the
battery<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:16.020> hard<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.500> turn<00:01:16.740> over

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
battery it's really hard to turn over

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
battery it's really hard to turn over
even<00:01:17.460> by<00:01:17.610> hand<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.090> almost<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.509> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
even by hand it's almost like it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
even by hand it's almost like it's
jammed<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> depending<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:21.000> whether

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
jammed in there and depending on whether

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.320 
jammed in there and depending on whether
the<00:01:21.479> motor<00:01:21.689> stops<00:01:22.670> sometimes<00:01:23.670> it'll<00:01:23.909> start<00:01:24.240> up

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the motor stops sometimes it'll start up

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.969 
the motor stops sometimes it'll start up
again<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> put<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> battery<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
again when you put the battery on and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.090 
again when you put the battery on and
sometimes<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> turn<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.990> bit

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
sometimes not so then you turn it a bit

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
sometimes not so then you turn it a bit
put<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> battery<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> she'll

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
put it back on the battery and she'll

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
put it back on the battery and she'll
turn<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.979> rip<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> apart<00:01:32.520> see

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
turn again so I'm gonna rip it apart see

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.170 
turn again so I'm gonna rip it apart see
what's<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.430> took<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> two

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
what's going on so I took off the two

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.069 
what's going on so I took off the two
7/16<00:01:37.170> bolts<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.729> held<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.180> together<00:01:39.360> popped

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
7/16 bolts that held it together popped

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.130 
7/16 bolts that held it together popped
it<00:01:40.290> open<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.150> here's<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> looks<00:01:42.659> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it open and here's what it looks like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.190 
it open and here's what it looks like
definitely<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.460> starter<00:01:44.820> shock<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
definitely the starter shock or the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.280 
definitely the starter shock or the
brushes<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:47.009> least<00:01:47.250> look<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
brushes at least look at that so that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.370 
brushes at least look at that so that
would<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.439> causing<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.220> short<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
would be causing a short in there and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
would be causing a short in there and
that's<00:01:52.380> why<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.860> turning<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.909> way

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's why it's not turning over the way

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.800 
that's why it's not turning over the way
it<00:01:54.090> should<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.979> armature<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.790> bad<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it should the armature is not bad that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.460 
it should the armature is not bad that
can<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.140> fixed<00:01:58.409> polished

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
can be fixed polished

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.040 
can be fixed polished
the<00:02:01.130> temperature<00:02:01.910> completely<00:02:02.690> off<00:02:02.810> you've

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
the temperature completely off you've

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.860 
the temperature completely off you've
got<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.200> remove<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.650> pin<00:02:03.980> from<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.640> here<00:02:04.940> you

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
got to remove this pin from in here you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.940 
got to remove this pin from in here you
can<00:02:06.050> use<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.260> pin<00:02:06.710> punch<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.400> punch<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.330> out

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
can use a pin punch and punch it out

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.170 
can use a pin punch and punch it out
then<00:02:09.950> these<00:02:10.190> parts<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.729> going<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.940> come<00:02:11.150> off

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
then these parts are going to come off

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.700 
then these parts are going to come off
make<00:02:11.690> sure<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.930> keep<00:02:12.080> them<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.470> same

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
make sure you keep them in the same

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.170 
make sure you keep them in the same
order<00:02:15.190> I'm<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.400> gonna<00:02:16.490> put<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
order I'm just gonna put this in a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
order I'm just gonna put this in a
container<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.500> don't<00:02:18.560> lose<00:02:18.950> them<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
container so that I don't lose them it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
container so that I don't lose them it
almost<00:02:22.850> looks<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.270> magnet<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.930> correct<00:02:24.260> so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
almost looks like a magnet is correct so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.050 
almost looks like a magnet is correct so
that<00:02:24.710> could<00:02:24.860> be<00:02:24.890> causing<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.370> problem<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.910> well

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that could be causing a problem as well

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.740 
that could be causing a problem as well
so<00:02:26.930> I'll<00:02:27.020> pull<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.690> see

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
so I'll pull this out so as you can see

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.350 
so I'll pull this out so as you can see
it's<00:02:30.440> finished

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it's finished

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.320 
it's finished
even<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.480> magnets<00:02:32.930> are<00:02:33.080> broken<00:02:34.210> from<00:02:35.210> inside

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
even the magnets are broken from inside

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.610 
even the magnets are broken from inside
brushes<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.290> finished<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:37.580> bark<00:02:37.910> here<00:02:38.620> may

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
brushes are finished this bark here may

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.860 
brushes are finished this bark here may
still<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.160> good<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:41.000> said<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.600> clean

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

the back here and there's the other part
of<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.740> I'll<00:02:46.610> see<00:02:46.820> if<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.210> find<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
of it so I'll see if I can find a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.610 
of it so I'll see if I can find a
starter<00:02:47.840> for<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:49.240> if<00:02:50.240> anybody<00:02:50.720> knows<00:02:50.990> where<00:02:51.560> I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
starter for it if anybody knows where I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.880 
starter for it if anybody knows where I
can<00:02:51.710> get<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.130> starter<00:02:52.700> or<00:02:53.410> starter<00:02:54.410> rebuild

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
can get a starter or starter rebuild

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.600 
can get a starter or starter rebuild
kits<00:02:55.310> for<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.060> let<00:02:56.630> me<00:02:56.660> know<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:58.130> magnets

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
kits for this let me know the magnets

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.490 
kits for this let me know the magnets
are<00:02:58.910> shot<00:02:59.240> that<00:03:00.020> open<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.230> need

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
are shot that open so it's gonna need

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.449 
are shot that open so it's gonna need
more<00:03:03.740> than<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.400> rebuild<00:03:05.120> kit<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.480> guess

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
more than just a rebuild kit I guess

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.900 
more than just a rebuild kit I guess
anyways<00:03:07.459> if<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.970> know<00:03:08.150> anything<00:03:08.390> let<00:03:08.780> me<00:03:08.810> know
