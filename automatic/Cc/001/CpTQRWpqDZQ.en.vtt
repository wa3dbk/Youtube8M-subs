00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the server settings personally I want to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290 
the server settings personally I want to
make<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.439> piston<00:00:19.949> drop<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.119> just

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
make a piston drop with this that just

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
make a piston drop with this that just
falls<00:00:21.449> down<00:00:21.750> into<00:00:22.020> an<00:00:22.170> iron<00:00:22.350> room<00:00:22.740> that's<00:00:23.010> made

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
falls down into an iron room that's made

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.450 
falls down into an iron room that's made
out<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.400> iron<00:00:23.970> tank<00:00:24.420> walls<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:26.099> these

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
out of iron tank walls and just these

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.849 
out of iron tank walls and just these
just<00:00:27.119> kill<00:00:27.510> anyone<00:00:27.810> who<00:00:27.960> falls<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> trap<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
just kill anyone who falls in the trap I

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.750 
just kill anyone who falls in the trap I
don't<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> think<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.460> would<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.609> pretty

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
don't know I think it would be pretty

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.590 
don't know I think it would be pretty
funny<00:00:30.170> anyways<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.980> gonna<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.369> 32<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> these

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
funny anyways I'm gonna make 32 of these

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.709 
funny anyways I'm gonna make 32 of these
so<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> would<00:00:34.860> take<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> half<00:00:36.329> stacks

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so that would take two and a half stacks

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.580 
so that would take two and a half stacks
of<00:00:36.960> iron<00:00:37.200> half<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> stack<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> redstone<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.590> one

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of iron half a stack of redstone and one

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.880 
of iron half a stack of redstone and one
stack<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.219> obsidian<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.559> ready<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
stack of obsidian which I have ready to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.959 
stack of obsidian which I have ready to
go<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:45.300> pocket<00:00:46.110> crafting<00:00:46.530> table<00:00:46.969> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
go here with my pocket crafting table so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.959 
go here with my pocket crafting table so
I'll<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.480> ahead<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:49.140> 32<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> these<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
I'll go ahead and make 32 of these and

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
I'll go ahead and make 32 of these and
every<00:00:53.969> time<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.270> place<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.170> there's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.010> one

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
every time you place these there's a one

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
every time you place these there's a one
in<00:00:56.399> ten<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> ten<00:00:57.270> percent<00:00:57.390> chance<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.260> an

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
in ten or a ten percent chance to get an

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
in ten or a ten percent chance to get an
Oracle<00:00:58.800> turret<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.309> doesn't<00:00:59.789> attack

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
Oracle turret which doesn't attack

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
Oracle turret which doesn't attack
anything<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.280> four<00:01:02.609> of

fun um I'm pretty sure if you get an

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
fun um I'm pretty sure if you get an
Oracle<00:01:42.869> first<00:01:43.320> yeah<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.220> normal<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.759> me

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
Oracle first yeah that's normal for me

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
Oracle first yeah that's normal for me
one<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.659> yeah<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> turns<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.369> and
