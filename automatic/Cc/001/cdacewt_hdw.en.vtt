00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
we're going to be looking at how to take

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.420 
we're going to be looking at how to take
apart<00:00:11.480> wood<00:00:12.480> trays<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.139> makes<00:00:14.010> a<00:00:14.100> piece<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
apart wood trays that makes a piece of

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.630 
apart wood trays that makes a piece of
use<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.850> put<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.180> back<00:00:15.299> together<00:00:15.570> again

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
use to put them back together again

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.980 
use to put them back together again
first<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:17.789> looking<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> block

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
first of all looking at the block

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.089 
first of all looking at the block
overall<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.190> probably<00:00:20.759> a<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.330> 20

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
overall I see that probably a good 20

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.499 
overall I see that probably a good 20
holes<00:00:23.099> have<00:00:23.369> been<00:00:23.490> filled<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> outside

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
holes have been filled from the outside

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.829 
holes have been filled from the outside
I<00:00:25.349> think<00:00:26.039> we'll<00:00:26.189> find<00:00:26.429> that<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:27.089> the<00:00:27.269> inside

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
I think we'll find that on the inside

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.480 
I think we'll find that on the inside
we'll<00:00:28.050> probably<00:00:28.259> have<00:00:28.500> seen<00:00:28.619> another<00:00:28.859> 10<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we'll probably have seen another 10 to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.570 
we'll probably have seen another 10 to
15<00:00:29.669> holes<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.839> partially<00:00:31.259> filled<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.619> mason

cardboard backing you will find it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.510 
cardboard backing you will find it
interesting<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> mason<00:01:13.500> bees<00:01:13.680> don't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
interesting that the mason bees don't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.630 
interesting that the mason bees don't
really<00:01:14.790> mind<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.470> we'll<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:17.520> get

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
really mind and we'll actually let's get

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
really mind and we'll actually let's get
this<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.030> light<00:01:18.590> we'll<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.800> fill<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this in the light we'll just fill the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.920 
this in the light we'll just fill the
first<00:01:20.760> part<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.750> mud

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
first part up with a little bit of mud

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500 
first part up with a little bit of mud
so<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.980> not<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.670> big<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.000> deal<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.480> the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
so it's not that big of a deal that the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.890 
so it's not that big of a deal that the
cardboard<00:01:25.230> backing<00:01:25.380> hasn't<00:01:26.540> completely<00:01:27.540> snug

cardboard backing hasn't completely snug

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.590 
cardboard backing hasn't completely snug
too<00:01:28.050> tight<00:01:28.260> but<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.980> didn't<00:01:29.370> generally<00:01:29.760> now

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
too tight but it didn't generally now

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.070

that the they stay in order these are

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.430 
that the they stay in order these are
interlocked<00:01:40.440> there's<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.080> negative

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
lot of pollen mites inside there this is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.330 
lot of pollen mites inside there this is
looking<00:02:54.630> pretty<00:02:54.780> good<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.530> that

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
this was the back side of the block and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.300 
this was the back side of the block and
here's<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.380> front<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.830> block

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
here's the front of the block

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.240 
here's the front of the block
I'm<00:02:59.940> only<00:03:00.450> looks<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.590> could<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.040> told

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
that one maybe two holes were filled but

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.180 
that one maybe two holes were filled but
see<00:03:06.330> how<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.600> thing<00:03:06.660> started<00:03:07.290> here<00:03:07.650> here

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
see how this thing started here here

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.940 
see how this thing started here here
these<00:03:08.790> guys<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.210> all<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.750> part<00:03:10.110> so

these guys are all in the back part so

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.780 
these guys are all in the back part so
it's<00:03:11.220> um<00:03:12.110> it's<00:03:13.110> almost<00:03:13.440> very<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.550> it's

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it's um it's almost very it is it's

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.000 
it's um it's almost very it is it's
deceiving<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> lot<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.560> people<00:03:16.800> will

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
deceiving that a lot of people will

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.820 
deceiving that a lot of people will
think<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.850> don't<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.330> many<00:03:18.480> bees<00:03:19.080> or

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
think they don't have that many bees or

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.260 
think they don't have that many bees or
cocoons<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.460> have<00:03:20.550> gone<00:03:20.670> inside<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
cocoons that have gone inside here and

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.050 
cocoons that have gone inside here and
and<00:03:21.570> then<00:03:21.720> actually<00:03:22.490> there<00:03:23.490> are<00:03:23.670> quite<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.000> few

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and then actually there are quite a few

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.970 
and then actually there are quite a few
because<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.870> bees<00:03:25.050> don't<00:03:25.320> always<00:03:25.560> go<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
because the bees don't always go to the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980 
because the bees don't always go to the
end<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.220> tubes<00:03:26.460> that's<00:03:27.210> why<00:03:27.390> our<00:03:27.420> easy

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
end of the tubes that's why our easy

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.080 
end of the tubes that's why our easy
tears<00:03:28.380> have<00:03:29.070> holes<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.610> back<00:03:29.760> which<00:03:30.060> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
tears have holes in the back which you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.560 
tears have holes in the back which you
can<00:03:30.360> tell<00:03:30.570> exactly<00:03:31.410> what<00:03:31.890> went<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.270> I've<00:03:33.270> now
