 hospitable than today helmut all the time 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
 from her own market cheap helmet 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 Christian Jewish Helmut was already like that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 often with us in the cooking courses 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.789
 Mainz met and a hobbys 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.760
 cook yes I am enthusiastic 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 Hobby chef seven and eight years old 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 area and a pleasing it is me 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 there is always something new to know what 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.770
 always can never know new 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 enough, but something new today 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 I always get to know about it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 I have never been to the market and I am 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.789
 already very curious how that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 do it together now 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.399
 judith it's easy you make me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.890
 now its 250 grams we turn the times 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.329
 balance on 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:05.610
 We take it to the crib of the medi 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:07.110
 You can do that with people and the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 250 grams 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 we are now counting on two-part 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.049
 you can also enter 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.460
 depending on how big the self twelve of the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.460
 13 but vice versa 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.560
 Now I would like to have two eggs 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.270
 Made in are now medium one 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.270
 standard exactly designed 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 We can now have four to six people 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.020
 depending on where it is used 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.909
 It is the location where you have a lot of la 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 says used pieces meet 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.689
 gulas then you will maybe only four 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 Maybe it will be like that 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.619
 something like eg with colorful hearts or 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.079
 you can maybe six people 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 but can mediate so for vegetarians 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.899
 Of course I was needed and no 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.830
 Meat is simply made into vegetables 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.720
 aprica broccoli whatever 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.880
 So we're going to scream now and what 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 I absolutely still have to do that 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.030
 Now about two tablespoons of water 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.400
 cold landlord tiger to direct to 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 processing is a bit easier 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.290
 to stir to budapest 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:57.430
 the actual blur 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:03:01.650
 so that you have everything from one source 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:17.440
 bring in a nice 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:22.750
 Now I have learned in a course now 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.560
 we will become different from this mass 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.580
 making things 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.510
 the first is the small patch 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.489
 cut yes then that's there 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.420
 and that's the only way around 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.769
 from the rest so I take now 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.769
 small piece of the day 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.930
 if you are so nice 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.600
 the dough rolled out 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.180
 So that's going to be years now 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:11.250
 it yes there is, then I do now 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 with the way to the right that too relative 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:20.680
 become uniform 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.600
 you can also still in to this, 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.950
 I do not like them either 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.930
 otherwise a ruler is used 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.780
 funny to cut very thin strips 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.810
 and schneider now it became even 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:43.360
 meet and then really together 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:45.990
 fast as a black angus that's yes 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.990
 really millimeter work 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:27.090
 why year into it and if then already 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:27.090
 I am able to talk 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.350
 the amount is bigger 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:54.770
 That's not my first release 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:59.479
 will be abolished 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:02.300
 and that I rather than soup insert her 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.340
 not and silinger could cake and 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.490
 Now I've been to this for a while 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.490
 do 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:18.979
 and then more so how about costs 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:24.560
 would be like telling the soup insert have 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:28.159
 you currently make something considered from it 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.030
 nor is it like the hungry of the committee 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:35.860
 risotto rice decibel 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.990
 yes yes enter the same club 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.169
 you do not have to season it special 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.759
 So that's as I said there you can 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.270
 choose yourself as you would like 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.969
 that's the classic story and 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.110
 Of course they report on paprika 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.800
 to do our state 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.169
 with powder and then you can of course 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.719
 later maybe fresh peppers 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.490
 So cut paprika height of 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.800
 to find steamed then we have 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.740
 or other vegetables then you have 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.259
 stop a vegetarian dish I say 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.819
 thank you for watching 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.469
 next time you are together 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.690
 ask the tv watch 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.680
 There are also follow the orders with 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.719
 make masks 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.090
 then you indeed waiting then we make a 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:23.599
 Now only chick the good heart and 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.969

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.219

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:31.490
 water cube with the warburger volker
