shaping it into the shape you want

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.940 
shaping it into the shape you want
because<00:02:21.840> at<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.989> certain<00:02:22.019> point<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.709> going<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
because at a certain point it's going to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.380

become<00:02:23.099> like<00:02:23.370> felt<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.000> won't<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.330> able

become like felt and you won't be able
to<00:02:24.480> shape<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> anymore<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to shape it anymore so you don't want it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.170
