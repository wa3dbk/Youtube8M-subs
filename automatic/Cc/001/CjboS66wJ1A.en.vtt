took me like two license and two
collages<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.760> actually<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.389> smell<00:04:40.630> out

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
collages to actually get the smell out

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.980 
collages to actually get the smell out
so<00:04:41.199> I'm<00:04:41.350> expecting<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.639> same<00:04:42.910> with<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.539> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
so I'm expecting the same with this and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.460 
so I'm expecting the same with this and
also<00:04:44.919> because<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.490> use<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:46.000> dye<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.840> don't<00:04:47.289> know

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
also because I use the dye I don't know

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.790 
also because I use the dye I don't know
is<00:04:47.800> because<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.460> know<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.760> has<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.800> whatever

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
is because you know it has a whatever

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.740 
is because you know it has a whatever
the<00:04:51.039> readings<00:04:51.550> are<00:04:51.729> in<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.000> dye<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.570> you

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
the readings are in the dye that you

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.420 
the readings are in the dye that you
know<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:53.260> don't<00:04:53.590> know<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:53.800> it's<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.010> boy<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.220> don't

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
know I don't know if it's a boy I don't

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.200 
know I don't know if it's a boy I don't
know<00:04:55.710> whatever<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:57.010> in<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.610> know<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:57.849> think

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
know whatever is in it you know I think

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.879 
know whatever is in it you know I think

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
you kind of killed the smell a little

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.710 
you kind of killed the smell a little
bit<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.400> then<00:05:00.849> once<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.180> washed<00:05:01.479> and

can think of is that they have a kind of

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.440

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
thing that I could think of they have

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.100
