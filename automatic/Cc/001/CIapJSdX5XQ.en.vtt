yeah hopefully I'm getting the angle

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.460 
yeah hopefully I'm getting the angle
right<00:00:56.180> anyway<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.540> easy<00:00:58.049> to<00:00:58.260> care

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.270 
oncidium it really likes bright light a
lot<00:01:03.299> of<00:01:03.449> moisture<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.080> pot<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:05.010> very

good ventilation and yeah whenever a
pseudo<00:01:08.460> bulb<00:01:08.610> matures<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.479> should<00:01:09.689> produce<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
pseudo bulb matures it should produce a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.700 
pseudo bulb matures it should produce a
long<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.520> branchy<00:01:12.030> spike<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
long and branchy spike like this the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.709 
long and branchy spike like this the
fragrance<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.399> I<00:01:14.429> told<00:01:14.789> you<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.240> absolutely

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
fragrance as I told you is absolutely

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.580 
fragrance as I told you is absolutely
amazing<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.500> reminds<00:01:17.189> me<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> chocolate<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.590> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
amazing it reminds me of chocolate or of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
amazing it reminds me of chocolate or of
milk<00:01:20.280> chocolate<00:01:20.490> many<00:01:21.299> people<00:01:21.659> describe<00:01:21.899> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
milk chocolate many people describe it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.919 
milk chocolate many people describe it
as<00:01:22.289> vanilla<00:01:22.979> chocolate<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.329> guess<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
as vanilla chocolate so I guess it

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.870 
as vanilla chocolate so I guess it
depends<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.679> each<00:01:26.070> person<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.789> each

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
depends on each person and each

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.330 
depends on each person and each
individual<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:28.140> everyone<00:01:28.560> describes<00:01:29.009> sent

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
individual as everyone describes sent

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
individual as everyone describes sent
their<00:01:29.609> own<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.780> describe<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
their own way I would really describe it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.520 
their own way I would really describe it
as<00:01:31.530> milk<00:01:32.340> chocolate<00:01:32.969> but<00:01:33.659> anyway<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.350> you're

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
as milk chocolate but anyway if you're

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
as milk chocolate but anyway if you're
looking<00:01:34.859> for<00:01:35.069> an<00:01:35.280> orchid<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.819> will<00:01:35.939> blow

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
looking for an orchid that will blow

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
looking for an orchid that will blow
your<00:01:36.299> mind<00:01:36.359> away<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.890> surprise<00:01:38.460> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your mind away or a surprise for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
your mind away or a surprise for
somebody<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.719> is<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> orchid<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
somebody this is the orchid for you I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
somebody this is the orchid for you I
don't<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.179> that<00:01:42.509> common<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> find<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
don't think it's that common to find a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
don't think it's that common to find a
flower<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.100> smells<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.700> chocolate<00:01:45.409> anyway

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
flower that smells like chocolate anyway

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.489 
flower that smells like chocolate anyway
my<00:01:46.890> particular<00:01:47.479> version<00:01:48.479> doesn't<00:01:48.840> overpower

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
my particular version doesn't overpower

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.279 
my particular version doesn't overpower
me<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.609> doesn't<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.329> manage<00:01:51.749> to<00:01:51.929> fill<00:01:52.170> up

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
me it doesn't really manage to fill up

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.169 
me it doesn't really manage to fill up
the<00:01:52.469> whole<00:01:52.619> balcony<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> scent<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.939> can

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
the whole balcony with the scent I can

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.020 
the whole balcony with the scent I can
feel<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.689> stand<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.889> one<00:01:56.700> meter<00:01:56.850> away

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
feel it if I stand about one meter away

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.059 
feel it if I stand about one meter away
from<00:01:57.179> it<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.929> really<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.289> overpowering

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
from it but it's really not overpowering

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.370 
from it but it's really not overpowering
which<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.850> I'd<00:02:00.030> prefer<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
which I think I'd prefer because if I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.459 
which I think I'd prefer because if I
have<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:02.429> orchids<00:02:02.999> in<00:02:03.299> bloom<00:02:03.630> fragrant<00:02:04.289> or

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
have more orchids in bloom fragrant or

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.139 
have more orchids in bloom fragrant or
case<00:02:04.709> I<00:02:04.889> really<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.880> overlap

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
case I really don't want them to overlap

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.600 
case I really don't want them to overlap
each<00:02:06.479> other<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.590> yeah<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> guess<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
each other so yeah I guess this is a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.120 
each other so yeah I guess this is a
very<00:02:08.850> good<00:02:09.090> hybrid<00:02:09.660> I'd<00:02:10.110> also<00:02:10.440> heard<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.860> some

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
very good hybrid I'd also heard of some

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.280 
very good hybrid I'd also heard of some
try<00:02:11.370> colors<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.360> indeed<00:02:12.810> give<00:02:13.140> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
try colors that do indeed give you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.180 
try colors that do indeed give you
headaches

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
headaches

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.550 
headaches
so<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.610> guess<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.120> depends<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.320> clone

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so I guess it just depends on the clone

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
so I guess it just depends on the clone
you<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:17.100> again<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.940> not<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> registered

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you have again it's not a registered

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.220 
you have again it's not a registered
clone<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.860> might<00:02:20.130> find<00:02:20.160> some<00:02:21.230> differences

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
clone so you might find some differences

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.460 
clone so you might find some differences
between<00:02:23.120> particular<00:02:24.120> individuals<00:02:25.020> some

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
between particular individuals some

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.970 
between particular individuals some
color<00:02:25.770> differences<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.670> fragrance

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
color differences or fragrance

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.250 
color differences or fragrance

difference<00:02:39.210> triggers<00:02:39.750> blooming<00:02:40.260> because

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
