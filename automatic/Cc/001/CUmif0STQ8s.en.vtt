 it has happened to them good it turns out that we are 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.260
 looking for survivors to be able to do 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.690
 a group and set up in a city that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.350
 is not infected and we are by 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.820
 the way about three survivors but 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.770

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.750
 thing and we also escaped with a 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.450
 helicopter but we crash into this 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.790

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.500
 a clear question what this this is not 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.810
 the place where the infection started 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.810
 Unfortunately, yes and I will tell you how 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.820
 it happened was a day where one guy 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.310
 doctor a server threw a green bottle 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.340
 bright of that strange bottle called 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.190
 904 virus say they came out 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.560
 sparks that spread across the sky 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.930
 dropping every spark of the virus for all 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.910
 parties but once a citizen what 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 worsened everything wanting to have the power 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.010
 of the 1,240 virus it was not known how it got to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.130
 the top of the clark building itself 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.380
 until he touched the 1.240 virus and it came out 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.390
 a red ball hitting the same 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.040
 sparks came out and until lightning 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.280
 strange blue fell on the tape 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.020
 to people and infecting the fastest 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.920
 after the citizen evolved 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.320
 the 904 virus over 1,240 making that 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.330
 every spark fell on a citizen this 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.410
 mutate to for unknown reasons until 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.410
 leave him dead alive 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.190
 can someone tell me where we are 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.830
 You have woken up how good at last 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.530
 you woke up he helped us and brought us 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.810
 here I feel something strange that's 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.000
 because it gives you two sedatives so you do not get 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.970
 hurt the wound too much thanks 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.400
 help me for nothing hear you want to stay 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.830
 to live in this place for now clear 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.890
 we would like but what can we do to 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.140
 thank the good guys I will give them a 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.300
 easy mission on the other side of this 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.130
 place there is a base that is a 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.810
 house full of food it turns out that 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.730
 we lived there but then we 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.270

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.640

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.500
 Stay to rest as you want, I'll leave you 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.980

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.980
 barrel 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.410
 everything is as planned 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.540
 How silly when you realize that there is 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.590
 dynamite will be exploited and the infected 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.590

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.370
