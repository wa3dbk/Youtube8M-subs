00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:12.339
 let's go so we present the attention 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.379
 first in the history of mazda rx-8 above you 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:21.759
 pendants 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:24.640
 attention to the wheel arch and now 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.740
 no problems with snow clearance 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.849
 and so on I do not have by definition 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.469
 I'm going where I want but if I want a suspension 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.760
 we let go and undercuts 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.760
 or higher 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 wait a minute experiment 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.170
 window i think we redo the whole machine 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.120
 purely over the sky it will be cool so we 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.329
 got rid of two shortcomings mazda 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.239
 rx-8 is a fucking very bad engine with 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:24.759
 small resources we put it from 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:36.390
 priors and I will tell why we are all 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:39.550
 made nemo cylinder 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.009
 it's with mercedes actros 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.009
 nemo cylinder that holds the cabin 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.189
 puff original mazda rx-8 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.070
 here is this part getting off swing with one blow 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.079
 hammer we get a rack 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.250
 then it needs a little bit machined under 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.299
 landing seat of his cylinder 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 dresses about like this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:12.640
 and we get snow suspension cost here 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.940
 This here is nonsense 383 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.540
 that is, cheaper rowing thanks for all 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 Attention 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 to be continued
