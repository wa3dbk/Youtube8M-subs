00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
is l-drago energy train and it looks

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.930 
is l-drago energy train and it looks
exactly<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:10.019> l-drago<00:00:10.559> destroyed<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.550> 4d

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
exactly like l-drago destroyed the 4d

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.470 
exactly like l-drago destroyed the 4d
beyblade<00:00:12.330> which<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.080> pretty<00:00:13.530> cool<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.480> yeah

beyblade which is pretty cool and yeah
so<00:00:15.719> here's<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> box<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so here's the front of the box and the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.590 
so here's the front of the box and the
back<00:00:21.240> um<00:00:22.460> alright<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.580> let's<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.359> what<00:00:24.510> this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
back um alright so let's see what this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.109 
back um alright so let's see what this
one<00:00:24.660> does

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
one does

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.140 
one does
okay<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.230> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.410> normal<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.519> right

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
okay so this is normal and this right

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.049 
okay so this is normal and this right
here<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.769> guess<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.369> guessing<00:00:32.940> it's

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
here I guess it's I'm guessing it's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.400 
here I guess it's I'm guessing it's
rubber<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:34.710> pops<00:00:35.010> out<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.520> does<00:00:36.000> like

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
rubber and it pops out and does like

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.459 
rubber and it pops out and does like
energy<00:00:37.410> drain<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.210> spin<00:00:39.210> stealing<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:40.170> like

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
energy drain or spin stealing just like

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.869 
energy drain or spin stealing just like
what<00:00:40.739> other<00:00:41.040> L<00:00:41.340> trackers<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
what other L trackers do all right so

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
what other L trackers do all right so

don't<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.379> saw<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> stores<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
don't really like I saw in the stores I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.670 
don't really like I saw in the stores I
didn't<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> gimmick<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
record drone and this one looks pretty

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
record drone and this one looks pretty
cool<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> looks<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> separates

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cool like it looks like it separates

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.600 
cool like it looks like it separates
into<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.579> beyblades<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.920> yeah<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.489> see

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
into two beyblades and yeah I didn't see

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
into two beyblades and yeah I didn't see
this<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.790> stores<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.299> maybe<00:01:06.479> I'll<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
this in stores but maybe I'll get it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010 
this in stores but maybe I'll get it
if<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> lion's<00:01:09.450> lair<00:01:09.570> Stadium

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
if I do see it and lion's lair Stadium

nothing else inside and let's just give
away<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> code<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.210> here's<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
away the code right now so here's the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
away the code right now so here's the
front<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> KO<00:01:41.040> card<00:01:41.329> oops

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so um this is a lock monster red I've

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
so um this is a lock monster red I've
ever<00:01:51.270> seen<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> red<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.500> orange

ever seen a red one and then an orange

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.179 
ever seen a red one and then an orange
dragon<00:01:53.579> record<00:01:54.560> let's<00:01:55.560> take<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> look<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
dragon record let's take a look at the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.960 
dragon record let's take a look at the
instructions<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.030> how<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> works

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
instructions to see how it works

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.970 
instructions to see how it works
but<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:01.340> set<00:02:01.610> weapon<00:02:01.970> push<00:02:02.360> rubberized<00:02:03.290> guards

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
but to set weapon push rubberized guards

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.510 
but to set weapon push rubberized guards
in<00:02:04.510> until<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.690> blocks<00:02:05.960> turn<00:02:06.260> blip<00:02:06.500> kind<00:02:07.430> of

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
in until the blocks turn blip kind of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.820 
in until the blocks turn blip kind of
like<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> pegasus<00:02:08.149> jumper<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:08.830> something

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
like the pegasus jumper but something

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.450 
like the pegasus jumper but something
else<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.280> push<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.330> oh<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.250> goes

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
else so push this in oh and there goes

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.630 
else so push this in oh and there goes
and<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:15.110> right<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:16.340> what<00:02:16.610> activates<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and this right here is what activates it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.320 
and this right here is what activates it
easy<00:02:19.640> as<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.500> okay<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.740> tip<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.250> flat<00:02:23.000> so

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
easy as that and okay the tip is flat so

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
easy as that and okay the tip is flat so
it's<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.800> attack<00:02:25.070> type<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:26.480> does<00:02:27.190> look

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's an attack type and this does look

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's an attack type and this does look
like<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.760> lot<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:29.330> l-drago<00:02:30.170> destroy<00:02:32.530> even<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
like a lot like l-drago destroy even the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.990 
like a lot like l-drago destroy even the
designs<00:02:34.430> right<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:36.580> looks<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.730> mix

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
designs right here looks like a mix

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.180 
designs right here looks like a mix
between<00:02:38.060> l-drago<00:02:38.690> destroy<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.590> ultimate

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
between l-drago destroy and ultimate

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.510 
between l-drago destroy and ultimate
meteo<00:02:41.060> l-drago<00:02:41.330> or<00:02:42.170> just<00:02:43.010> medial<00:02:43.310> l-drago

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
meteo l-drago or just medial l-drago

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.960 
meteo l-drago or just medial l-drago
however<00:02:45.160> really<00:02:46.160> nice<00:02:46.400> color<00:02:46.610> scheme<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:48.970> mean

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
however really nice color scheme I mean

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.410 
however really nice color scheme I mean
this<00:02:50.240> is<00:02:50.420> plastic<00:02:50.990> oh<00:02:51.459> no<00:02:52.459> metal<00:02:52.730> mean<00:02:53.180> but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
I'm about to test the l-drago energy

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.150 
I'm about to test the l-drago energy
drain<00:03:17.620> stealth<00:03:18.620> battler<00:03:19.209> alright<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.630> um<00:03:21.200> this

beyblade<00:03:22.519> came<00:03:22.760> with<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.300> regular<00:03:24.019> light

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
beyblade came with a regular light

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.789 
beyblade came with a regular light
launcher<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:26.450> does<00:03:26.720> work<00:03:27.050> with<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.590> light

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799

yeah and it also works with a stream

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.640 
yeah and it also works with a stream
launcher<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.099> if<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.580> guys<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> left

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
launcher if you if you guys have a left

launcher if you if you guys have a left
spin<00:03:40.650> string<00:03:40.980> launcher<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:42.150> works<00:03:42.390> with<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
spin string launcher it works with that

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.240 
spin string launcher it works with that
as<00:03:43.110> well<00:03:45.230> alright<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.440> let's<00:03:46.620> see<00:03:46.800> if<00:03:46.920> we<00:03:46.980> could

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
as well alright so let's see if we could

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:56.410 
as well alright so let's see if we could
get<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:48.830> energy<00:03:49.830> draining<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.910> deploy<00:03:54.260> well<00:03:55.260> I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
get the energy draining to deploy well I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.720 
get the energy draining to deploy well I
might<00:03:57.420> not<00:03:57.540> hit<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.810> figure<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.860> let's<00:03:59.459> try

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
might not hit it figure so let's try

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.470 
might not hit it figure so let's try
what<00:04:02.120> there<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.180> go

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
what there you go

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.130 
what there you go
and<00:04:03.569> as<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.950> can<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.459> lot<00:04:05.610> lower<00:04:06.140> so

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and as you can see it's a lot lower so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.020 
and as you can see it's a lot lower so
you<00:04:07.170> could<00:04:07.410> hit<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.590> bottom<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.579> opposing

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
you could hit the bottom of the opposing

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.539 
you could hit the bottom of the opposing
beyblade<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:11.989> absorb<00:04:12.989> some<00:04:13.110> spin<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.340> let's

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
beyblade and absorb some spin so let's

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.710 
beyblade and absorb some spin so let's
try<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.880> one<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.030> time<00:04:20.359> there<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.450> go

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
try that one more time there you go

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.060 
try that one more time there you go
and<00:04:21.810> there<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.889> again<00:04:24.410> alright<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.889> is<00:04:25.919> my

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and there it again alright so that is my

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.909 
and there it again alright so that is my
unboxing<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.970> testing<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:30.200> l-drago<00:04:31.200> energy

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
unboxing and testing of l-drago energy

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.430 
unboxing and testing of l-drago energy
