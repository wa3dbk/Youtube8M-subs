pretty<00:03:13.800> much<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.100> approach<00:03:14.459> which<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.820> said

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
pretty much my approach which I said

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.460 
pretty much my approach which I said
it's<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.209> pretty<00:03:15.360> much<00:03:15.450> basic<00:03:15.959> eating<00:03:16.230> clean

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it's just pretty much basic eating clean

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.310 
it's just pretty much basic eating clean
and<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.980> cardio<00:03:17.840> that's<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.959> lot<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.080> stuff

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and all the cardio that's a lot of stuff

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.009 
and all the cardio that's a lot of stuff
but<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.130> more<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:21.239> get<00:03:21.420> back<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.690> Train<00:03:21.900> like

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
but the more they get back to Train like

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.270 
but the more they get back to Train like
than<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> old<00:03:22.590> days<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.950> where<00:03:23.070> they<00:03:23.130> need

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
heart rates going and yeah pretty much

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.289 
heart rates going and yeah pretty much

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
was like doing cardio so you should do a

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.570 
was like doing cardio so you should do a

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
couple of sessions at bay but pretty

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.710 
couple of sessions at bay but pretty
much<00:03:44.700> just<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.239> would<00:03:45.390> need<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.600> do

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
cardio but like I said something goes

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.800 
cardio but like I said something goes
now

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
now

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.990 
now
the<00:03:48.380> gym<00:03:48.710> sessions<00:03:49.160> are<00:03:49.340> getting<00:03:49.730> somewhat

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
the gym sessions are getting somewhat

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.430 
the gym sessions are getting somewhat
shorter<00:03:50.480> but<00:03:50.720> then<00:03:50.870> there's<00:03:51.020> Cillian<00:03:51.320> all

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
shorter but then there's Cillian all

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.380 
shorter but then there's Cillian all
these<00:03:51.560> food<00:03:51.800> without<00:03:52.670> burning<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.120> up<00:03:53.210> so<00:03:53.360> I

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
these food without burning it up so I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.700

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
can move on the note but they could do

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.360 
can move on the note but they could do
it<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.270> way<00:04:41.330> baby<00:04:41.570> try<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.840> do<00:04:42.080> six<00:04:42.919> or<00:04:43.070> seven

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
it that way baby try to do six or seven

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.010 
it that way baby try to do six or seven
exercises<00:04:43.700> per<00:04:44.180> them<00:04:44.480> take<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.690> while<00:04:44.900> until

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
exercises per them take a while until

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.200 
exercises per them take a while until
the<00:04:45.140> whole<00:04:45.260> body<00:04:45.470> especially<00:04:45.850> plates<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.030> do

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
the whole body especially plates you do

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.210 
the whole body especially plates you do
them<00:04:47.360> first<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.720> go<00:04:47.840> up<00:04:48.080> like<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:48.980> I

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
them first to go up like this but I

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.830 
them first to go up like this but I
think<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:49.850> do<00:04:49.970> want<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.150> be<00:04:50.240> fine<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.450> always

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
think you do want to be fine I always

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.150 
think you do want to be fine I always
thought<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.260> would<00:04:51.350> be<00:04:51.440> bad<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.620> do<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:52.010> give

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
thought it would be bad and do that give
