fiddle player or maybe you're thinking
of<00:00:27.900> playing<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> fiddle<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.939> it's

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
of playing the fiddle and and it's it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.389 
of playing the fiddle and and it's it's
a<00:00:30.510> daunting<00:00:30.779> idea<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.740> play<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> second

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
a daunting idea to play a second

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
a daunting idea to play a second
instrument<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.390> interesting<00:00:33.870> thing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
instrument well the interesting thing

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
instrument well the interesting thing
about<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> mandolin<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> mantle<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
about the mandolin is that the mantle is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
about the mandolin is that the mantle is
tuned<00:00:35.700> exactly<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> same<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> fiddle

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tuned exactly the same way as a fiddle

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.330 
tuned exactly the same way as a fiddle
so<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.920> play<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> scale<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> fiddle<00:00:40.340> it's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so if I play a scale on the fiddle it's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
so if I play a scale on the fiddle it's
exactly<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> same<00:00:42.120> fingering<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
exactly the same fingering on the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
exactly the same fingering on the
mandolin<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> pick<00:00:44.550> which

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
mandolin and you get to use a pick which

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
mandolin and you get to use a pick which
for<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.329> people<00:00:45.360> especially<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.440> converted

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
for some people especially a converted

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
for some people especially a converted
guitar<00:00:47.190> player<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> neat<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.719> be

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
guitar player so is a neat thing that be

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
guitar player so is a neat thing that be
able<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> use<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> pick<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> bowl<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> tricky

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
able to use a pick the bowl is a tricky

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
able to use a pick the bowl is a tricky
little<00:00:51.120> piece<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.390> work<00:00:51.539> anyways<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.739> you're

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
little piece of work anyways if you're

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
little piece of work anyways if you're
thinking<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.579> taking<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> second

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
thinking about taking up a second

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
thinking about taking up a second
instrument<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> fiddle<00:00:56.280> player<00:00:56.309> I'd<00:00:56.730> highly

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
instrument as a fiddle player I'd highly

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
instrument as a fiddle player I'd highly
recommend<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.629> Madelon<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.590> thing<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
recommend the Madelon for one thing the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
recommend the Madelon for one thing the
Madelon<00:00:59.219> although<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.570> slick<00:01:00.899> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
Madelon although it's not as slick for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
Madelon although it's not as slick for
playing<00:01:01.730> fast<00:01:02.730> snappy<00:01:03.359> fiddle<00:01:03.629> tunes<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
playing fast snappy fiddle tunes the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
playing fast snappy fiddle tunes the
picking<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.439> tougher<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.610> thing<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> could

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
picking is tougher one thing you could

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.219 
picking is tougher one thing you could
do<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.180> mandolin<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> can't<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.110> on

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
do on the mandolin that you can't do on

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
do on the mandolin that you can't do on
the<00:01:07.320> fill<00:01:07.500> very<00:01:07.710> well<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.189> play<00:01:08.430> really

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the fill very well is play really

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.240 
the fill very well is play really
intricate<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> interesting<00:01:10.710> chord

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
intricate and and interesting chord

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640 
intricate and and interesting chord
progressions<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.360> interestingly<00:01:12.840> enough<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
progressions so interestingly enough and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
progressions so interestingly enough and
the<00:01:13.860> oddly<00:01:14.189> enough<00:01:14.280> I've<00:01:14.520> also<00:01:14.700> published<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the oddly enough I've also published a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.440 
the oddly enough I've also published a
book<00:01:15.390> called<00:01:15.500> mandolin<00:01:16.500> chord<00:01:16.740> ology<00:01:17.450> which

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
book called mandolin chord ology which

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
book called mandolin chord ology which
is<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.710> subtitle<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> create

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is if the subtitle is how to create

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
is if the subtitle is how to create
every<00:01:21.299> chord<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.900> ever<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
every chord you will ever need and so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
every chord you will ever need and so
one<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> things<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> happens<00:01:24.509> with

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
one of the things that happens with

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
one of the things that happens with
fiddle<00:01:24.900> players<00:01:25.080> they<00:01:25.320> pick<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> mandolin

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
fiddle players they pick up the mandolin

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
fiddle players they pick up the mandolin
and<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:27.150> try<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> play<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> exactly<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and they try to play it exactly like the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.590 
and they try to play it exactly like the
fiddle<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.850> probably<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.360> playing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
fiddle and so they probably are playing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
fiddle and so they probably are playing
it<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:31.409> poorly<00:01:31.710> than<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> fiddle<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.490> when

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it more poorly than the fiddle but when
