00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
video here on some on my Galaxy s6 and

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.520 
video here on some on my Galaxy s6 and
galaxy<00:00:05.850> s6<00:00:06.720> clones<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:08.400> can<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.880> see<00:00:09.170> it<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
galaxy s6 clones so can you see it the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980 
galaxy s6 clones so can you see it the
real<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:11.400> because<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> bunch

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
real one here because I do have a bunch

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.090 
real one here because I do have a bunch
of<00:00:13.200> fakes<00:00:14.450> or<00:00:15.450> that's<00:00:16.020> actually<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> real

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
of fakes or that's actually not the real

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.529 
of fakes or that's actually not the real
deal<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:18.300> are<00:00:18.330> all

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
deal but you can see that they are all

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.640 
deal but you can see that they are all
pretty<00:00:19.080> pretty<00:00:19.320> familiar<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.289> can<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.380> find

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
pretty pretty familiar so can you find

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.179 
pretty pretty familiar so can you find
the<00:00:22.859> fake<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:26.359> that's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> good<00:00:27.630> question<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.510 

probably<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:33.140> but<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:35.160> impressive

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
probably can but it's very impressive

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
probably can but it's very impressive
how<00:00:35.850> great<00:00:36.090> they<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> real<00:00:37.980> deal

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
how great they are because the real deal

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.590 
how great they are because the real deal
the<00:00:38.730> real<00:00:38.760> galaxy<00:00:39.390> s6<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.800> collection<00:00:41.100> it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
the real galaxy s6 in this collection it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010 
the real galaxy s6 in this collection it
costs<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:43.640> like<00:00:44.640> seven<00:00:45.210> times<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.899> or

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
costs actually like seven times more or

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.119 
costs actually like seven times more or
something<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:47.010> price<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
something in price but this one is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.060 
something in price but this one is
actually<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.969> real<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.860> probably

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
actually the real one as you probably

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
actually the real one as you probably
can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
can see it's a little bit of a a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.420 
can see it's a little bit of a a
difference<00:00:57.469> see<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
difference see here you can see it the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
difference see here you can see it the
displays<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.629> sharper

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
displays use a little bit sharper

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
displays use a little bit sharper
definitely<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.730> terms<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> performance

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
definitely but in terms of performance

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
definitely but in terms of performance
here<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.619> very

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
here you can see that they are very

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
here you can see that they are very
familiar<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> new

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
familiar you can see if you have a new

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
familiar you can see if you have a new
Google<00:01:07.770> widget<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> updated<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
Google widget which is updated so you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
Google widget which is updated so you
know<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> real<00:01:11.369> there

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
know that it's like the real there

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
know that it's like the real there
probably<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> white<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.260> there

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
probably if you have the white one there

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070 
probably if you have the white one there
but<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.720> kind

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but you see here you have different kind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.520 
but you see here you have different kind
of<00:01:16.140> colors<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> also<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
of colors you can also see that the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.969 
of colors you can also see that the
icons<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> enterings<00:01:20.580> leaves<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.240> bit

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
icons and enterings leaves a little bit

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.640 
icons and enterings leaves a little bit
different<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> top<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
different but at the top there it is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.149 
different but at the top there it is
them<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.330> very<00:01:27.450> identical<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
them this is very very identical but you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
them this is very very identical but you
can<00:01:29.310> also<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.180> difference<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
can also see the difference here on the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
can also see the difference here on the
back<00:01:33.560> compared<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:35.579> clones<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
back compared to these clones so you can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
back compared to these clones so you can
see<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:37.890> clones<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.640> over<00:01:38.880> here

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
see that these clones I have over here

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.319 
see that these clones I have over here
has<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.530> real<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.369> white<00:01:41.670> around

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
has the real one has like white around

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200 
has the real one has like white around
there<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> top<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.310> also<00:01:44.520> has<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
there at the top it also has more of a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
there at the top it also has more of a
like<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> white<00:01:45.750> colored<00:01:46.380> back

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
like a white colored back

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
like a white colored back
this<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.700> has<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> other<00:01:48.899> color

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
this one has some kind of other color

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.700 
this one has some kind of other color
almost<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.829> blueish<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:51.079> but<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
almost like blueish I think but this one

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
almost like blueish I think but this one
does<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> big<00:01:53.549> difference<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.689> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
does the big difference here as you can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080 
does the big difference here as you can
see<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.399> camera<00:01:56.880> area

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
see there on that the the camera area

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.200 
see there on that the the camera area
you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.290> also<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.880> some

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can also see you do get some

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
you can also see you do get some
official<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.350> something<00:02:01.860> text<00:02:02.219> down<00:02:02.399> here

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
official like something text down here

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.410 
official like something text down here
which<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.340> clone<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
which you don't get on this clone so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
which you don't get on this clone so
that<00:02:06.540> could<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.960> pretty<00:02:07.350> pretty<00:02:07.500> fun

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that could also be pretty pretty fun

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.999 
that could also be pretty pretty fun
there<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> know

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
there too just to know

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.179 
there too just to know
and<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.489> CEO<00:02:12.090> sue<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.110> some<00:02:13.379> button

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
and the CEO sue can you see some button

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.710 
and the CEO sue can you see some button
differences<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.299> can<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.540> they're<00:02:15.689> both

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
differences you can see they're both

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.729 
differences you can see they're both
kind<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.799> light<00:02:17.189> up<00:02:17.400> very<00:02:18.470> very<00:02:19.470> similar

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
kind of light up very very similar

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.429 
kind of light up very very similar
actually<00:02:20.159> but<00:02:20.549> here<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.569> quick

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
actually but here you have them a quick

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:30.470 
actually but here you have them a quick
access<00:02:22.650> there<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.959> @dm<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:27.230> D<00:02:28.230> dialer<00:02:29.480> you

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
access there to @dm the D dialer you

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.240 
access there to @dm the D dialer you
don't<00:02:30.659> get<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.079> on<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.829> clone<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
don't get that on this clone here and I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.979 
don't get that on this clone here and I
mean<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.579> looks<00:02:35.760> way<00:02:36.239> different<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.750> course

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
mean it looks way different of course

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.220 
mean it looks way different of course
because<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.950> doesn't<00:02:38.129> have<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
because this one doesn't have the the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.819 
because this one doesn't have the the
official<00:02:40.790> galaxy<00:02:41.790> s6<00:02:42.180> touch<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.049> UI<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.739> of

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
official galaxy s6 touch with UI so of

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.089 
official galaxy s6 touch with UI so of
course<00:02:44.069> they<00:02:44.819> look<00:02:44.970> very<00:02:45.239> very<00:02:45.569> different<00:02:46.099> you

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
course they look very very different you

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.569 
course they look very very different you
can<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.400> here<00:02:47.670> also<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.420> folders<00:02:49.379> look<00:02:49.920> very

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
can see here also how folders look very

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.720 
can see here also how folders look very
very<00:02:50.609> different<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.769> go<00:02:53.040> into<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
very different and if you go into the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.129 
very different and if you go into the
app<00:02:53.940> drawer<00:02:54.329> as<00:02:54.540> well<00:02:54.889> we<00:02:55.889> can<00:02:56.159> see<00:02:56.519> some<00:02:57.139> some

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
app drawer as well we can see some some

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.559 
app drawer as well we can see some some
differences<00:02:58.680> here<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.239> let's<00:03:00.239> see<00:03:00.420> if

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
differences here and there let's see if

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.500 
differences here and there let's see if
we<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:02.450> hold<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.659> here<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.359> power<00:03:07.220> screen

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
we can hold in here to the power screen

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.149 
we can hold in here to the power screen
you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.659> see<00:03:09.810> they're<00:03:10.049> also<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
you can see they're also kind of

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.360 
you can see they're also kind of
identical<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.389> little<00:03:12.810> bit<00:03:12.959> slimmer<00:03:13.950> there

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
identical but a little bit slimmer there

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.379 
identical but a little bit slimmer there
I<00:03:14.870> may<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:15.930> some<00:03:16.379> men<00:03:16.590> some<00:03:17.040> gaming<00:03:17.250> videos<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
I may do some men some gaming videos and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.909 
I may do some men some gaming videos and
try<00:03:18.540> them<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:19.349> performance

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
try them out like that in performance

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.339 
try them out like that in performance
because<00:03:20.220> clearly<00:03:20.940> as<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.269> see<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.810> like

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
because clearly as you can see in like

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.229 
because clearly as you can see in like
normal<00:03:22.650> performance<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.760> actually

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
normal performance it can actually

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.490 
normal performance it can actually
perform<00:03:24.680> pretty<00:03:25.680> well<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> also<00:03:31.139> in

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
perform pretty well but here you also in

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
perform pretty well but here you also in
terms<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.739> multitasking<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.609> can<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> big

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
terms of multitasking you can see a big

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.990 
terms of multitasking you can see a big
big<00:03:33.690> difference<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.040> yeah<00:03:35.310> quick<00:03:35.819> your

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
big difference there so yeah quick your

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.470 
big difference there so yeah quick your
video<00:03:36.329> checking<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:37.349> just<00:03:37.680> for<00:03:37.859> fun<00:03:38.480> it's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
video checking it out just for fun it's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.030 
video checking it out just for fun it's
very<00:03:39.750> easy<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.319> you<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.829> that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
very easy to you know not that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.699 
very easy to you know not that
experience<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.790> get<00:03:41.970> one<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.329> these<00:03:42.480> fake<00:03:43.440> ones

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
experience to get one of these fake ones

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.339 
experience to get one of these fake ones
probably<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.699> just<00:03:45.359> be<00:03:45.569> aware<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
probably so just be aware of that and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.299 
probably so just be aware of that and
then<00:03:46.889> yeah<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> lot<00:03:47.669> like<00:03:47.849> peace
