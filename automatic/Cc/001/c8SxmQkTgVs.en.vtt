Decay

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.890 
Decay
so<00:00:25.699> I've<00:00:25.789> already<00:00:25.970> compared<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.480> cover<00:00:26.660> brands

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
so I've already compared to cover brands

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.720 
so I've already compared to cover brands
against<00:00:27.169> another<00:00:27.380> including<00:00:27.829> the<00:00:28.130> Urban

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
against another including the Urban

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.909 
against another including the Urban
Decay<00:00:28.820> primer<00:00:29.269> potion<00:00:29.529> and<00:00:30.529> I've<00:00:30.619> tried<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
Decay primer potion and I've tried the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.679 
Decay primer potion and I've tried the
back<00:00:31.070> 104<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:31.880> little<00:00:32.060> bit<00:00:32.210> now<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.630> think

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
back 104 a little bit now and I think

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.150 
back 104 a little bit now and I think
you<00:00:32.900> would<00:00:32.989> benefit<00:00:33.290> most<00:00:33.500> from<00:00:33.620> be<00:00:33.829> cooperate

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
you would benefit most from be cooperate

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.310 
you would benefit most from be cooperate
against<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:34.550> one<00:00:34.760> rather<00:00:35.329> than<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.840> benefit

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
against this one rather than the benefit

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.889 
against this one rather than the benefit
stay<00:00:36.739> don't<00:00:36.770> stray<00:00:36.950> or<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.670> earth<00:00:38.000> mineral

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
stay don't stray or the earth mineral

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.210 
stay don't stray or the earth mineral
eyeshadow<00:00:39.050> primer<00:00:39.440> which<00:00:39.710> are<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.950> other<00:00:40.010> two

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
eyeshadow primer which are the other two

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.130 
eyeshadow primer which are the other two
my<00:00:40.310> compared<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.390> today<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.630> will<00:00:41.810> be<00:00:41.900> wearing

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
my compared so today I will be wearing

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.440 
my compared so today I will be wearing
urban<00:00:42.530> decay<00:00:42.740> on<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.190> side<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:43.640> lorac<00:00:44.210> on

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
urban decay on this side and lorac on

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.540 
urban decay on this side and lorac on
this<00:00:44.750> eye<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.740> I'm<00:00:46.010> just<00:00:46.130> going<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.370> use<00:00:46.520> my

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
this eye so I'm just going to use my

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:57.980 
this eye so I'm just going to use my
finger<00:00:48.250> spread<00:00:49.250> that<00:00:49.430> over<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.820> eye

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.600 

you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.460 

so<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.210> initial<00:01:03.360> comparison<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.320> in

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so my initial comparison just in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
so my initial comparison just in
application<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.580> lorac<00:01:06.000> has<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
application is that lorac has a little

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.150 
application is that lorac has a little
bit<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.660> oiliness<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.010> more

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
bit more oiliness and a little bit more

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.710 
bit more oiliness and a little bit more
slick<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.090> might<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.480> good<00:01:09.690> thing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
slick to it which might be a good thing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
slick to it which might be a good thing
and<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.040> idea<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and because the kind of the idea of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.160 
and because the kind of the idea of
primers<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.830> stop<00:01:13.830> oil<00:01:14.100> absorbing<00:01:14.970> through

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
primers is to stop oil absorbing through

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
primers is to stop oil absorbing through
and<00:01:16.170> whereas<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.310> mccain<00:01:17.640> felt<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> little

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and whereas the our mccain felt a little

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
and whereas the our mccain felt a little
bit<00:01:18.300> drier<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.720> texture<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.830> we'll<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.100> how

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
bit drier in texture but we'll see how

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
bit drier in texture but we'll see how
they<00:01:20.370> set<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.940> we'll<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.960> hold<00:01:22.140> up

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
they set and we'll see how they hold up

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.930 
they set and we'll see how they hold up
with<00:01:22.440> shadow<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
with shadow so now I'm just going to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.670 
with shadow so now I'm just going to
apply<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.420> makeup<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> I'll<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.200> back

so I'm back with all my makeup on and if

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.359 
so I'm back with all my makeup on and if

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you'd like to see a tutorial for this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520 
you'd like to see a tutorial for this
look<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.000> I'll<00:01:30.210> put<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> link<00:01:30.660> somewhere<00:01:30.900> here

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
look then I'll put a link somewhere here

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
look then I'll put a link somewhere here
and<00:01:31.740> I'll<00:01:31.830> also<00:01:31.979> link<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.550> off<00:01:32.670> down<00:01:32.880> below<00:01:33.020> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and I'll also link it off down below so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
and I'll also link it off down below so
I<00:01:34.050> basically<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.680> done<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.450> deck<00:01:36.450> black<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I basically just done a deck black a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
I basically just done a deck black a
smoky<00:01:37.710> eye<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.490> any<00:01:38.640> creasing<00:01:39.090> should<00:01:39.360> show<00:01:39.660> up

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
smoky eye so any creasing should show up

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.930 
smoky eye so any creasing should show up
pretty<00:01:39.930> clearly<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.830> did<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> base<00:01:41.610> just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
pretty clearly I did use a base just

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.280 
pretty clearly I did use a base just
underneath<00:01:42.300> though<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.660> did<00:01:42.810> try<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> keep

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
underneath though and I did try to keep

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
underneath though and I did try to keep
it<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.880> under<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.180> crease<00:01:45.390> line<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> don't

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it and under the crease line so I don't

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
it and under the crease line so I don't
expect<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.920> too<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.250> fading<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> lid

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
expect to see too much fading on the lid

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.450 
expect to see too much fading on the lid
because<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> base<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.979> hopefully

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
because of the base and but hopefully

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
because of the base and but hopefully
any<00:01:51.060> creasing<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:52.500> still<00:01:52.710> show<00:01:52.890> through

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
any creasing and will still show through

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
any creasing and will still show through
so<00:01:53.850> there's<00:01:54.090> no<00:01:54.210> half<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> pantalla

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
agzam Ian I'll show you what they're

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.510 
agzam Ian I'll show you what they're
looking<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.830> here<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.160> what<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
looking like now so here is what the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.820 
looking like now so here is what the
creases<00:02:11.060> look<00:02:11.270> like<00:02:11.450> at<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.780> moment<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.500> so

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
creases look like at the moment and so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.280 
creases look like at the moment and so
favorite<00:02:13.340> creasing<00:02:13.790> coming<00:02:14.030> through<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.690> I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
favorite creasing coming through and I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.170 
favorite creasing coming through and I
think<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.190> black<00:02:16.520> really<00:02:16.850> helps<00:02:17.120> to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
think just the black really helps to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.590 
think just the black really helps to
short<00:02:17.480> off<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.489> yeah<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.550> fair<00:02:19.850> bit<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.209> both

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
short off so yeah a fair bit on both

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.350 
short off so yeah a fair bit on both
eyes<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.950> think<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.250> would<00:02:22.430> say<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.940> just

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
eyes but I think I would say and just

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.750 
eyes but I think I would say and just
from<00:02:23.600> looking<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.920> mirror<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.580> past

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
from looking in the mirror for the past

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.460 
from looking in the mirror for the past
few<00:02:25.970> hours<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.510> while<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:26.959> wearing<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.350> I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
few hours and while I was wearing it I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.010 
few hours and while I was wearing it I
found<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.610> lorac<00:02:28.880> was<00:02:29.120> creasing<00:02:29.569> faster

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
found that the lorac was creasing faster

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.110 
found that the lorac was creasing faster
anyway<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.310> we'll<00:02:31.550> see<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.819> they<00:02:31.970> look

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
anyway and so we'll see how they look

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.170 
anyway and so we'll see how they look
like<00:02:32.150> at<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> end<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.019> night<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:34.910> far

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
like at the end of the night but so far

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.610 
like at the end of the night but so far
um<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> far<00:02:38.930> well<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.290> make<00:02:39.440> your<00:02:39.590> own

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
um so far well you can make your own

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.520 
um so far well you can make your own
minds<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.070> but<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> think<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.780> Urban<00:02:42.080> Decay<00:02:42.140> eye

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
minds up but I think the Urban Decay eye

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.100 
minds up but I think the Urban Decay eye
looks<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.280> little<00:02:43.489> bit<00:02:43.730> better

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
looks a little bit better

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.280 
looks a little bit better
um<00:02:45.610> but<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.850> again<00:02:47.330> will<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:47.660> at<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> end<00:02:48.200> of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
um but we again will see at the end of

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.220 
um but we again will see at the end of
the<00:02:48.380> night<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.670> will<00:02:50.000> see<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.600> then

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.770 

hey<00:02:55.739> one<00:02:56.069> thought<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.489> back<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.090> no<00:02:57.270> happy

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hey one thought and back it is no happy

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.309 
hey one thought and back it is no happy

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.180 
just show you how they're wearing so
this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.870> what<00:03:04.019> we<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.349> at<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> end<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this is what we have at the end of the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.640 
this is what we have at the end of the
day<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.760> as<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> can<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.989> fairly

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
day and as you can see a fairly

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.339 
day and as you can see a fairly
decreasing<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.370> both<00:03:08.870> again<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> think<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
decreasing with both again I think the

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.160 
decreasing with both again I think the
black<00:03:10.560> helps<00:03:10.830> showed<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.610> bit<00:03:11.730> more<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.989> here

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
black helps showed up a bit more so here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.259 
black helps showed up a bit more so here
we<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.560> urban<00:03:13.920> decay<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:16.880> got<00:03:17.880> fair<00:03:18.150> bit

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
we have the urban decay I got fair bit

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.630 
we have the urban decay I got fair bit
of<00:03:18.330> creasing<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.819> this<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> lorac<00:03:21.900> eye

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
of creasing and this is the lorac eye

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.830 
of creasing and this is the lorac eye
so<00:03:23.640> format<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.150> kind<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.420> make<00:03:24.569> up<00:03:24.660> your

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
so format you can kind of make up your

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.080 
so format you can kind of make up your
own<00:03:24.870> mind<00:03:25.290> about<00:03:25.410> which<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.129> think<00:03:26.459> has<00:03:26.790> a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
own mind about which you think has a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.020 
own mind about which you think has a
worn<00:03:27.510> better<00:03:27.750> however<00:03:28.440> for<00:03:28.890> me<00:03:29.010> I'm<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.760> real

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
worn better however for me I'm in real

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.080 
worn better however for me I'm in real
life<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:31.040> obviously<00:03:32.040> day<00:03:32.370> lighting<00:03:32.640> and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
life in obviously day lighting and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.830 
life in obviously day lighting and
something<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.750> close<00:03:33.989> here<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.380> think<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.840> prefer

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
something up close here I think I prefer

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.470 
something up close here I think I prefer
the<00:03:37.709> herb<00:03:37.890> decay<00:03:38.280> eye<00:03:38.310> over<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.880> lorac<00:03:39.180> eye

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the herb decay eye over the lorac eye

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.690 
the herb decay eye over the lorac eye
and<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.920> little<00:03:40.950> bit

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and just that little bit

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.380 
and just that little bit
I<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.860> creasing<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.579> RAF<00:03:44.760> eye<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
I think the creasing in the RAF eye is

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.050 
I think the creasing in the RAF eye is
starting<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.380> spread<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.799> out<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> bit<00:03:47.060> I'm

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
starting to spread it out a bit I'm

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.400 
starting to spread it out a bit I'm
gonna<00:03:48.329> get<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.750> getting<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> little<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.260> more

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
gonna get just getting a little bit more

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.890 
gonna get just getting a little bit more
messy<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.120> even<00:03:51.120> though<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.450> crease<00:03:51.720> in

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
messy and even though there is crease in

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.440 
messy and even though there is crease in
here<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.110> think<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.180> creases

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
here I think it's just in the creases

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.850 
here I think it's just in the creases
not<00:03:54.780> coming<00:03:55.049> out<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.260> threaten<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.709> not

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
not coming out to threaten it's not

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.479 
not coming out to threaten it's not
trying<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.310> spread<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.760> way<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> it's

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
trying to spread that way and so it's

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.819 
trying to spread that way and so it's
not<00:03:59.549> as<00:03:59.760> messy<00:04:00.060> looking<00:04:00.480> that's<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.650> my

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
not as messy looking that's just my

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.729 
not as messy looking that's just my
opinion<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.489> how<00:04:02.700> they've<00:04:02.910> worn<00:04:03.180> for<00:04:03.329> me<00:04:03.480> today

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
opinion on how they've worn for me today

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.750 
opinion on how they've worn for me today

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
they might have different effects for

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.750 
they might have different effects for
you<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.480> all<00:04:06.660> depends<00:04:07.079> on<00:04:07.549> what<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:08.639> prefer

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
with the testing of the way I just go

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.640 
with the testing of the way I just go
through<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:14.359> details<00:04:15.359> awesome<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.350> for<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
through the details awesome so for the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.490 
through the details awesome so for the
lorac<00:04:17.160> behind<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.729> scenes<00:04:18.000> eye<00:04:18.299> primer<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:19.019> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
lorac behind the scenes eye primer and I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.190 
lorac behind the scenes eye primer and I
have<00:04:19.889> here<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.400> travel<00:04:20.970> size<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:22.049> is

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
have here the travel size so this is

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.350 
have here the travel size so this is
0.19<00:04:23.010> ounces<00:04:23.370> or<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.580> full<00:04:23.729> size<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.120> point

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
0.19 ounces or the full size is point

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.219 
0.19 ounces or the full size is point
five<00:04:24.570> ounces<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:25.830> retails<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:26.419> $21<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.690> as

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
five ounces it retails for $21 and as

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.379 
five ounces it retails for $21 and as
far<00:04:28.500> as<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:28.800> see<00:04:29.070> um<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.030> comes<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.300> the

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
far as I can see um it just comes in the

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.300 
far as I can see um it just comes in the
one<00:04:30.510> shade<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.050> then<00:04:31.740> obviously<00:04:31.919> they<00:04:32.250> do

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
one shade and then obviously they do

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.980 
one shade and then obviously they do
make<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.030> travel<00:04:33.389> size<00:04:33.539> as<00:04:33.570> well<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:33.930> I

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
make it in the travel size as well but I

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.090 
make it in the travel size as well but I
don't<00:04:34.200> think<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.440> can<00:04:34.560> actually<00:04:34.860> purchase

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
don't think you can actually purchase

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.920 
don't think you can actually purchase
this<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:36.120> think<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.450> comes<00:04:36.720> with

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
this and I think it just comes with

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.320 
this and I think it just comes with
palettes<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.470> things<00:04:37.680> then<00:04:38.460> for<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.880> Urban

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
palettes and things then for the Urban

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.350 
palettes and things then for the Urban
Decay<00:04:39.419> primer<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.860> retails<00:04:41.310> for<00:04:41.400> $20<00:04:42.330> or

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
Decay primer and it retails for $20 or

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.909 
Decay primer and it retails for $20 or
20<00:04:43.050> euros<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:44.370> get<00:04:44.520> 11<00:04:44.880> milliliters<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.169> a

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
20 euros you get 11 milliliters so a

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.920 
20 euros you get 11 milliliters so a
little<00:04:47.550> bit<00:04:47.729> less<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.389> urban<00:04:48.660> decay<00:04:48.750> you

little bit less in the urban decay you
get<00:04:49.729> 14.8<00:04:50.729> in<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.360> lorac<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> in<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.830> primer

slightly prefer
the<00:05:08.250> arm<00:05:08.460> decayed<00:05:08.970> just<00:05:09.360> by<00:05:09.480> the<00:05:09.540> testing<00:05:09.960> from

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
the arm decayed just by the testing from

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.260 
the arm decayed just by the testing from
today<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.770> that's<00:05:11.280> just<00:05:11.490> my<00:05:11.610> preference<00:05:11.880> and

again<00:05:12.870> these<00:05:12.990> might<00:05:13.170> wear<00:05:13.350> differently<00:05:14.190> in

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
again these might wear differently in

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.980 
again these might wear differently in
you<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.670> might<00:05:14.790> prefer<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.150> am<00:05:15.480> knock<00:05:15.810> over

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
Urban Decay so if I was just to go on

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.030 
Urban Decay so if I was just to go on
performance<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.750> price<00:05:19.200> alone<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.740> would<00:05:19.890> say

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
performance and price alone I would say

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.460 
performance and price alone I would say
Urban<00:05:20.370> Decay<00:05:20.640> but<00:05:21.270> at<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.480> same<00:05:21.600> time<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.260> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
Urban Decay but at the same time and the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.500 
Urban Decay but at the same time and the
full-size<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.010> rack<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:23.490> only<00:05:23.730> $1<00:05:24.270> extra

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
full-size of the rack is only $1 extra

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.080 
full-size of the rack is only $1 extra
and<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:24.930> get<00:05:25.140> another<00:05:25.620> point<00:05:26.190> one<00:05:26.760> or<00:05:26.790> two

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
and you get another point one or two

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.060 
and you get another point one or two
ounces<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.200> so<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.500> get<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.740> little<00:05:28.890> bit

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
ounces in it and so you get a little bit

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.810 
ounces in it and so you get a little bit
more<00:05:29.220> product<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.760> just<00:05:30.360> for<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.870> dollar<00:05:31.200> more

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
more product and just for a dollar more

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.360 
more product and just for a dollar more
but<00:05:32.820> for<00:05:33.030> me<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.180> would<00:05:33.390> fry<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.750> because<00:05:34.370> you

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
but for me I would fry this because you

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.280 
but for me I would fry this because you

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
dollar cheaper and for me it wears a

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.080 
dollar cheaper and for me it wears a
little<00:05:40.620> bit<00:05:40.710> better<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.520> those<00:05:41.700> are<00:05:41.910> my
