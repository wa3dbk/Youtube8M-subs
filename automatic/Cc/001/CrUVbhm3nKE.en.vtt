 Chelsea remained he sets the almost track 82 50 with two new top models and climbs 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 for the first time in the tractor class over 300 hp 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.109
 we already got to know the new flagship in practice 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.379
 Come with us on a test drive with the new Fast Track 83 10 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.210
 The appearance of the tractor has not changed much 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.900
 from the outside, the new fast track is like its predecessor 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.100
 the main innovations hide under the bonnet 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.770
 There now works a six-cylinder engine from Tepcos which Brauer 8 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 Comma 4 liters of displacement and a maximum of 310 hp 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.750
 the scr technology for exhaust aftertreatment is completely under the bonnet 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.480
 the 70 liter AdBlue Tonk was in the fuel tank on the left side 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.610
 integrated 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.830
 As a result, the diesel supply has shrunk to 550 liters 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.170
 For cleaning work, the cool package can be easily forward 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.440
 fold away 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.930
 but also the other maintenance points are easy to reach 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.520
 At the rear of the motorcycles the big fast Track lifts a maximum of ten point 3 tons 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.160
 There are up to four double-acting controllers and one external 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 Operations for Hohberg and set balls 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.359
 the optional front camera Teber has a lifting capacity of up to 3 point 5 tons 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.649
 In addition to a front Saab source, there are up to two additional taxes 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 in the big cabin you feel very well 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.879
 a comfortable workplace with low noise levels 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 Even with the operation you will find your way around quickly 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.420
 Over the colored fact screen monitors can be all important tractor 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.260
 Set functions and display 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.760
 even the occupancy of the CEO is thick box can be programmed here 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.779
 For the fast track, there is now an automatic steering system from the factory 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.769
 the steering he follows via an additional cylinder on the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.209
 Front 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.229
 Like all fast tracks, the new top models also have the proven 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.579
 Full suspension ABMS and disc brakes on all four wheels 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.739
 in combination with the Hanko continuously variable transmission we use this tractor 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.239
 the undisputed transport provider 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.239
 the maximum speed of 70 km / h 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.829
 will soon be fuel-efficient thousand 780 engine 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.829
 Revolutions reached 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:46.609
 the fast track has a curb weight of ten point 4 tons 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.959
 At 16 tonnes gross vehicle weight, they still remain so clock 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.989
 actual five commas six tons payload and that at 70 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.189
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.680
 Due to its high speed, the fast-track needs to be with one 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.160
 maximum of maturation 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.440
 of 710 70 of 38 on the rear end 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.340
 but these limitations will be due to the suspension and the better 

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.959
 Weight distribution balanced again an almost track has about a thousand 

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:31.109
 Kilograms more on the front axle than a standard standard stock ear 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.860
 We drove the tractor court where he feels most comfortable in transport 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.310
 waiting for the finish line made the fast-track a good figure whether at 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.030
 fast loading in the field or during transport over long distances on the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.090
 Street 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.379
