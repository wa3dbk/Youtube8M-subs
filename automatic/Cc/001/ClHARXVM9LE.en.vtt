00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
is seems to be a better deal and like I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
is seems to be a better deal and like I
said<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.939> only<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.090> controller<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.540> really

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
said like only one controller is really

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.850 
said like only one controller is really
necessary<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.310> more

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
necessary the other one is just more

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.650 
necessary the other one is just more
easier<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.430> not<00:02:00.580> necessary<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.480> it's

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
easier but it's not necessary and it's

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.740 
easier but it's not necessary and it's
80<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.800> maybe<00:02:03.010> like<00:02:03.100> 100-something<00:02:03.850> bugs

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750
