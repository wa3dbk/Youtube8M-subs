00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.660
 there came a word that means pleasure 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.760
 we know it in the bottle and we listen to the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.330
 cork noise that uncovers our 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.170
 senses but we really know how to 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.080
 create this drink of Caesars 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.270
 we know it comes from the grape but which one 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.480
 is the process that takes us from a 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.400
 delicious grape to a more elaborate delicacy 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.140
 at our table 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.930
 Join us on a burst trip to 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 know quickly what is the process 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.480
 of the creation of wine 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.530
 the history of wine begins in the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.780
 vineyard with the vintage the vintage is the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.060
 process with which the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.360
 better grapes to start with your 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.390
 processing in antiquity is 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.550
 labor was completely manual now 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.440
 there are specialized machines for 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.440
 homework 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.230
 the harvesters have the sensitivity 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.960
 and the knowledge to recognize which 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.450
 cluster will give an excellent product and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.450
 discard the less fortunate vine 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 the next step is grinding 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 abolishing is a process they manage to prepare 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.340
 the grape of your bunch leaving it the most 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.170
 clean possible this is the first filter 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.170
 of purification of the vine 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.600
 the third step is the pressing the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.010
 pressed is to get the grape 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.700
 free all of your cube this is a process 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.030
 methodical and slow at present 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.210
 there are producers who still use 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.430
 the artisan method of dancing on 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.430
 grapes to extract their cubes 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.970
 the next pattern is fermentation 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.240
 the fermentation process is defined 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.680
 as the formation of alcohol through 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.790
 the sugars of the grape 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.609
 from this moment the time plays 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.409
 an indispensable role to achieve a 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.409
 excellent determined end 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.800
 yes 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 the clarification is the next stage 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.050
 being this the last but one on the way 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.800
 as its name indicates the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.340
 clarification seeks to clean the product 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.489

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.629

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.350
 launch quality controls 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 they are rigorous by much and belittle 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.820
 the others this is the most 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.190

 in a summarized way we have seen how it 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:26.849
 creates a work of art on the palate 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.250
 technological advances added to a 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.979
 craft knowledge give us as 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.480
