00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.930
 the question sounds so hello svetlana 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.590
 I'm 53 years old from them I was only married 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.960
 half a year 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 relationship with another married man was 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 but as soon as he made me an offer 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.489
 living together suddenly I didn't need myself 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.649
 I have achieved enough of everything myself 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 much more than the average 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.300
 man i have a good education 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 adult educated son and naturally 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.719
 the bar is very high 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.780
 Yes, and I'm used to living all the time seeking 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.170
 overcome another of his line and only then 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.899
 rest I understand that I live is not right but 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 how to change myself I do not see decent and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.430
 desired never considered a man 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 younger by age and now when I see 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 single weave or older he seems to me 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 my grandfather 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.820
 so how to change your look oh no how 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 change your view on men olga 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.710
 let's start from the end here 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 realizing that I live is not right but how 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.850
 yourself change here is an interesting question who 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 inspired you to live wrong 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.799
 be sure to be married 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.909
 to be with a man is an order of society 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.390
 let's say that society is so tuned today 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.009
 women very often 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 much more energetic much stronger 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.119
 much more interesting as they are more flexible 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.509
 nervous system 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.329
 they can very much they much 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.570
 achieve and I will not say that all but 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.950
 many men at a certain age 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.630
 start back like 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.409
 they want more and more to lie on the couch 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.640
 less moving and I understand your 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.010
 desires 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.650
 be with a man who is more energetic 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.690
 which is by virtue of its age 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.890
 more energetic and therefore younger, I understand that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.560
 after 50 years many men fail 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.800
 first results let's say so i don't 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.350
 I think that every woman must 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 to be officially married myself 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.420
 I have an interesting man in it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.700
 man name is enough so here's what 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 I wanted to tell you Olga first of all 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.160
 need first 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.970
 understand what you want personally you do not society not 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.750
 society is not native not even the son namely 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.190
 you what you need to understand it and start 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.830
 movement exactly in this direction is 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.110
 be sure to do it about what I mean 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.540
 I will speak my own in my new 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.650
 coaching program 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.590
 be sure to first 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.050
 understand what you want not to do what 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.250
 want others not to adapt to 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.620
 the whole world of course we must 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.420
 conform to society we live in it 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.940
 we can't be free of it this 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.190
 true but there are things that every 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.019
 woman decides for himself and if you 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.200
 don't want to be married 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.329
 it does not mean that you are completely flawed 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.680
 no, it just means you don't want to 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.510
 be married 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.000
 if you need a man who is younger 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.950
 means you need a man who 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.560
 younger than you are because you are energetic and 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.239
 interesting woman 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 nothing wrong with that. same as 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.970
 some girls want to be with 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.410
 a man who is much older 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.209
 that's why I created my 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.730
 coaching program I have more than once 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.010
 ran across this question here as me 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.859
 change how do i get started 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.590
 fit society sometimes up need 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.079
 change and sometimes not just need 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.510

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.090
