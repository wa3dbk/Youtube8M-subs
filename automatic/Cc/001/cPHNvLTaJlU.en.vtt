00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
increase out of it and then no one will

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.490 
increase out of it and then no one will
take<00:02:18.269> damage<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:18.989> too<00:02:19.140> far<00:02:19.349> away

you<00:02:19.620> mind<00:02:19.920> over<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.250> speed<00:02:20.489> increase

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
you mind over that speed increase

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.789 
you mind over that speed increase
because<00:02:21.030> you'll<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.390> flying<00:02:21.659> for<00:02:22.019> longer<00:02:22.379> so

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
because you'll be flying for longer so

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.559 
because you'll be flying for longer so
just<00:02:23.129> make<00:02:23.250> sure<00:02:23.370> you're<00:02:23.519> fairly<00:02:23.819> close<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
can stampeding roar and when you go into

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.580 
can stampeding roar and when you go into
the<00:02:45.569> last<00:02:45.720> physical<00:02:46.140> switches<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the last physical switches of the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.289 
the last physical switches of the
tornado<00:02:46.829> face<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.459> stampeding<00:02:47.970> rule<00:02:48.120> all

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
tornado face you can stampeding rule all

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.400 
tornado face you can stampeding rule all
the<00:02:48.420> way<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.959> then<00:02:49.079> all<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> way<00:02:49.319> back

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the way there and then all the way back

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.309 
the way there and then all the way back
to<00:02:49.590> when<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.340> changes<00:02:50.700> sides<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.959> that's

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
to when it changes sides and and that's

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.960 
to when it changes sides and and that's
exactly<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.129> same<00:02:53.250> as<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.579> her<00:02:53.670> okay<00:02:53.790> this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
exactly the same as is on her okay this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.759 
exactly the same as is on her okay this
makes<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.390> quick<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.140> nicer<00:02:55.440> for

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
makes it so quick it's just nicer for

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.229 
makes it so quick it's just nicer for
you<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> need<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> make<00:02:56.910> sure<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
you so you need to make sure that you

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.610 
you so you need to make sure that you
deal<00:02:57.359> with<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.569> particular<00:02:57.840> mechanic<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
deal with this particular mechanic and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.839 
deal with this particular mechanic and
all<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> other<00:02:58.920> mechanics<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.459> are<00:02:59.549> normal

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
all the other mechanics there are normal

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.640 
all the other mechanics there are normal
mode<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.180> then<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.140> need<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.379> look<00:03:01.500> at

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
mode and then you need to look at

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.229 
mode and then you need to look at
transitioning<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> boss<00:03:02.579> into<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.060> last

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
transitioning the boss into the last

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.240 
transitioning the boss into the last
phase<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.629> twenty<00:03:04.019> percent<00:03:04.290> however<00:03:05.010> it's

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
phase of twenty percent however it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.710 
phase of twenty percent however it's
very<00:03:05.459> very<00:03:05.670> important<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.239> don't<00:03:06.390> just

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
very very important that you don't just

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.170 
very very important that you don't just
willy-nilly<00:03:06.870> throw<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.890> boss<00:03:08.040> over<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.640> go

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
willy-nilly throw the boss over and go

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.690 
willy-nilly throw the boss over and go
straight<00:03:09.390> into<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.690> last<00:03:09.900> phase<00:03:10.140> because<00:03:10.980> if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
straight into the last phase because if

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.610 
straight into the last phase because if
you<00:03:11.909> get<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.120> unseen<00:03:12.450> strike<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.140> before<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you get an unseen strike just before you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.770 
you get an unseen strike just before you
decide<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.099> transition<00:03:14.730> people<00:03:15.540> are<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.690> to

be<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.930> low<00:03:16.049> health<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.129> are

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
be on low health and when you are

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.559 
be on low health and when you are
transitioning<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:17.970> cannot<00:03:18.239> control<00:03:18.419> your

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
character and you are taking taking

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.800 
character and you are taking taking
damage<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:20.940> already<00:03:21.120> low<00:03:21.419> when<00:03:21.690> you're

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.849 
and he'll to the opposite side of the
room<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:03.660> do<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.109> then<00:04:04.290> heal<00:04:04.500> up<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.829> a

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
room then do that then heal up as a

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.379 
room then do that then heal up as a
group<00:04:05.069> otherwise<00:04:05.370> then<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.910> know<00:04:06.000> just<00:04:06.209> run

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
group otherwise then you know just run

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.580 
group otherwise then you know just run
straight<00:04:06.510> over<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:06.989> mean<00:04:07.139> it<00:04:07.290> depends<00:04:07.500> on

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
straight over there I mean it depends on

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.020 
straight over there I mean it depends on
your<00:04:07.709> healer<00:04:07.980> composition<00:04:08.579> as<00:04:08.699> well<00:04:08.849> as<00:04:08.940> you

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
your healer composition as well as you

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.729 
your healer composition as well as you
have<00:04:09.150> lots<00:04:09.359> of<00:04:09.569> mobile<00:04:09.900> healers<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.500> can

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
have lots of mobile healers then you can

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.470 
have lots of mobile healers then you can
just<00:04:10.980> run<00:04:11.160> straight<00:04:11.340> over<00:04:11.730> there<00:04:11.819> but

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
just run straight over there but

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.569 
just run straight over there but
essentially<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.019> last<00:04:13.290> phase<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.859> just

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
essentially this last phase it's just

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.310 
essentially this last phase it's just
exactly<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.150> same<00:04:15.389> as<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.599> was<00:04:15.840> or<00:04:15.989> normal

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
exactly the same as it was or normal

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.469 
exactly the same as it was or normal
avoid<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.799> tornados<00:04:17.310> get<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> bus<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.329> the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
avoid the tornados get to the bus on the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.210 
avoid the tornados get to the bus on the
other<00:04:18.660> side<00:04:18.810> using<00:04:18.989> various<00:04:19.500> speed<00:04:19.739> increases

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
