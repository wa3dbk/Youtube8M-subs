I<00:00:44.760> started<00:00:45.629> skeleton<00:00:46.079> racing<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.890> couple<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I started skeleton racing a couple of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
I started skeleton racing a couple of
years<00:00:47.760> ago<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.480> another<00:00:48.719> girl<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
years ago there was another girl that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
years ago there was another girl that
wanna<00:00:49.379> care<00:00:49.649> who<00:00:49.859> he<00:00:50.340> used<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.640> participate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
wanna care who he used to participate

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
wanna care who he used to participate
and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> love<00:00:52.530> any<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> sport<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and I love any kind of sport so I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
and I love any kind of sport so I
thought<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.300> should<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.170> give<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> go

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
thought I should just give it a go

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.660 
thought I should just give it a go
during<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.519> offseason<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.329> training

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
during the offseason or training

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.250 
during the offseason or training
capitalize<00:00:59.239> everyday<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.110> either

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
capitalize everyday and either

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.790 
capitalize everyday and either
strengthen<00:01:01.070> power<00:01:02.500> biometrics<00:01:03.500> slow

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
strengthen power biometrics slow

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.250 
strengthen power biometrics slow
bounding<00:01:04.430> hopping<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.479> again<00:01:05.720> improve<00:01:05.870> your

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
bounding hopping to again improve your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.890 
bounding hopping to again improve your
power<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:07.250> pulling<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.880> sled<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:08.659> can

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
power and then pulling a sled so we can

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.649 
power and then pulling a sled so we can
get<00:01:09.680> stronger<00:01:10.040> in<00:01:10.280> our<00:01:10.369> running<00:01:10.580> style<00:01:11.000> or

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
get stronger in our running style or

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.050 
get stronger in our running style or
using<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.650> sled<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.190> lose<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.580> wheels

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
using the sled that we lose on wheels

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.210 
using the sled that we lose on wheels
to<00:01:14.360> simulate<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:15.080> push<00:01:15.440> starts<00:01:15.920> at<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
to simulate that push starts at the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.080 
to simulate that push starts at the
start<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.759> skeleton<00:01:17.240> race<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:18.820> think<00:01:19.820> New

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
start of the skeleton race I think New

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.820 
start of the skeleton race I think New
Zealanders<00:01:20.660> have<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.259> rely<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.530> their

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
Zealanders have to rely on their

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.719 
Zealanders have to rely on their

for the last few years they've they've

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.779 
for the last few years they've they've
made<00:01:30.080> sleds<00:01:30.470> with<00:01:30.649> wheels<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:31.640> can

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
made sleds with wheels on so we can

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.960 
made sleds with wheels on so we can
train<00:01:32.090> here<00:01:32.390> where<00:01:32.600> we<00:01:32.690> don't<00:01:32.780> have<00:01:33.020> any<00:01:33.200> ice

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
train here where we don't have any ice

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.410 
train here where we don't have any ice
we<00:01:34.970> just<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> best<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:37.149> see<00:01:38.149> what<00:01:38.300> we
