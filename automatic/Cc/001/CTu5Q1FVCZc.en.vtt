better<00:00:18.910> than<00:00:19.119> console<00:00:19.480> B<00:00:19.630> so<00:00:19.869> many<00:00:20.020> times

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
better than console B so many times

before<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.680> starts<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:20.950> get<00:00:21.100> rather

get I think it may be a little too soon
to<00:00:25.510> really<00:00:25.930> be<00:00:26.050> talking<00:00:26.380> about<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.680> specs<00:00:26.950> of

talked-about thing right now seems to be
the<00:00:44.260> graphic<00:00:44.589> specs<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.920> Microsoft's<00:00:45.429> new

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
these specs are true then it appears

these specs are true then it appears
that<00:00:49.179> this<00:00:49.449> time<00:00:49.690> they<00:00:49.870> aren't<00:00:50.050> going<00:00:50.289> for<00:00:50.469> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
that this time they aren't going for the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.380 
that this time they aren't going for the
big<00:00:50.800> leap<00:00:51.100> in<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.370> next<00:00:51.579> gaming<00:00:51.879> generation

if this information is true then the

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.709 
if this information is true then the
first<00:00:54.729> question<00:00:55.089> we<00:00:55.210> would<00:00:55.359> have<00:00:55.479> to<00:00:55.569> ask

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
first question we would have to ask

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.840 
first question we would have to ask
ourselves<00:00:55.899> is<00:00:56.289> why<00:00:56.710> would<00:00:56.949> Microsoft<00:00:57.460> do<00:00:57.670> this

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
ourselves is why would Microsoft do this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.969 
ourselves is why would Microsoft do this
there's<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.690> lot<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:58.960> answers<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.379> this<00:00:59.499> maybe

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
there's a lot of answers to this maybe

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:00.779 
there's a lot of answers to this maybe
they're<00:01:00.190> following<00:01:00.489> in<00:01:00.639> Nintendo's

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
they're following in Nintendo's

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.759 
they're following in Nintendo's
footsteps<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.899> is<00:01:02.050> they<00:01:02.289> notice<00:01:02.649> how

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
footsteps that is they notice how

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.590 
footsteps that is they notice how
successful<00:01:03.309> Nintendo<00:01:03.760> was<00:01:03.969> this<00:01:04.150> June<00:01:04.420> with<00:01:04.570> a

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
successful Nintendo was this June with a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.969 
successful Nintendo was this June with a
console<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.080> wasn't<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.560> much<00:01:05.799> more

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
console that wasn't that much more

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.620 
console that wasn't that much more
powerful<00:01:06.190> than<00:01:06.520> their<00:01:06.640> previous<00:01:06.850> though<00:01:07.600> I

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
powerful than their previous though I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.210 
powerful than their previous though I
think<00:01:07.960> if<00:01:08.080> this<00:01:08.229> assumption<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.800> true<00:01:08.980> then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
think if this assumption is true then

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.220 
think if this assumption is true then
they<00:01:09.340> may<00:01:09.550> be<00:01:09.580> making<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.090> mistake<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.750> would

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
they may be making a mistake I would

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.600 
they may be making a mistake I would
have<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.470> assume<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> reason<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.310> Tendo

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
have to assume that the reason in Tendo

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.860 
have to assume that the reason in Tendo
did<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.000> was<00:01:13.150> because<00:01:13.420> they<00:01:13.600> weren't<00:01:13.750> going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
did that was because they weren't going

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.360 
did that was because they weren't going
to<00:01:13.990> repeat<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.380> same<00:01:14.500> actions<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.070> they<00:01:15.190> did

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
to repeat the same actions as they did

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.190 
to repeat the same actions as they did
last<00:01:15.400> June<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.030> making<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.510> console<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:16.960> as

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
last June of making a console that as

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.540 
last June of making a console that as
most<00:01:17.380> people<00:01:17.650> know<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:17.950> more<00:01:18.130> powerful<00:01:18.430> than

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
most people know was more powerful than

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.310 
most people know was more powerful than
the<00:01:18.670> huge<00:01:18.910> success<00:01:19.120> that<00:01:19.330> was<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.660> ps2<00:01:20.110> yet

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
the huge success that was the ps2 yet

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.140 
the huge success that was the ps2 yet
still<00:01:20.620> not<00:01:20.830> being<00:01:21.040> all<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.370> successful<00:01:21.790> and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
still not being all that successful and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.820 
still not being all that successful and
the<00:01:22.540> reason<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.870> say<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.350> mistake<00:01:23.650> is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
the reason I say this is a mistake is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.860 
the reason I say this is a mistake is
because<00:01:24.100> unlike<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.520> Gamecube<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.060> Xbox<00:01:25.390> 360

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
because unlike the Gamecube the Xbox 360

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.960 
because unlike the Gamecube the Xbox 360
was<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.020> big<00:01:26.230> success<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.370> Microsoft<00:01:27.580> is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
was a big success so if Microsoft is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.670 
was a big success so if Microsoft is
trying<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.300> follow<00:01:28.480> in<00:01:28.720> Nintendo's<00:01:28.870> footsteps

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
the hell they were talking about but I

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.640 
the hell they were talking about but I
think<00:02:55.659> a<00:02:55.720> lot<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.930> people<00:02:56.139> should<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.409> seen

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.699 
actions especially since as we can see
it<00:03:31.389> looks<00:03:31.510> like<00:03:31.629> Nintendo<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.229> gonna<00:03:32.409> once

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.150 
then the outcome for Nintendo may have
had<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> better<00:04:37.990> chance<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.440> being<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.800> exact
