00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.920 

I<00:00:58.600> mean<00:00:59.010> the<00:01:00.010> object<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.579> exercise<00:01:00.930> should

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
I mean the object of the exercise should

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.299 
I mean the object of the exercise should
be<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.170> get<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.380> right<00:01:02.530> this<00:01:02.739> is<00:01:02.920> actually<00:01:03.250> a

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
be to get it right this is actually a

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.840 
be to get it right this is actually a
very<00:01:03.550> significant<00:01:04.449> point<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.250> looks<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:06.820> if

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
very significant point it looks as if

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.610 
very significant point it looks as if
they<00:01:07.180> going<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.479> ask<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.080> there's<00:01:08.260> been<00:01:08.410> no

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
they going to ask for it there's been no

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.210 
they going to ask for it there's been no
signal<00:01:09.220> here<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:11.110> may<00:01:11.380> well<00:01:11.590> be<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
signal here so it may well be that the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.310 
signal here so it may well be that the
we<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.580> television<00:01:13.000> company<00:01:13.630> will<00:01:13.840> be<00:01:13.869> asked

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
we as a television company will be asked

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.940 
we as a television company will be asked

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
to supply some replays as possible here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.980 
to supply some replays as possible here
there<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.759> mind<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.300> we<00:01:19.420> haven't<00:01:19.720> got<00:01:19.810> any

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
there in mind that we haven't got any

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.350 
there in mind that we haven't got any
pictures<00:01:20.229> or<00:01:20.680> any<00:01:20.920> cameras<00:01:21.400> exactly<00:01:21.970> square

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
pictures or any cameras exactly square

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.090 
pictures or any cameras exactly square
we've<00:01:22.720> got<00:01:22.960> them<00:01:23.140> in<00:01:23.320> line<00:01:23.560> with<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.800> stumps

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
we've got them in line with the stumps

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100 
we've got them in line with the stumps
for<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> run<00:01:24.490> outs<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:25.660> is<00:01:25.750> where<00:01:25.869> sometimes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
for the run outs this is where sometimes

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.020 
for the run outs this is where sometimes
it's<00:01:26.530> just<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.710> little<00:01:26.890> bit<00:01:27.009> unfair<00:01:27.369> where<00:01:27.700> am

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
it's just a little bit unfair where am

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.090 
it's just a little bit unfair where am
we're<00:01:28.570> expected<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.140> be<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.440> adjudicator

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
we're expected to be the adjudicator

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.770 
we're expected to be the adjudicator
yeah<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:30.550> could<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.789> significant<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:31.450> David

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
yeah this could be significant as David

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.400 
yeah this could be significant as David
hooks<00:01:31.930> pointed<00:01:32.289> out<00:01:33.000> he<00:01:34.000> did<00:01:34.210> say<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.720> if

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
hooks pointed out he did say that if

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.920 
hooks pointed out he did say that if
Lehman<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.460> joined<00:01:36.759> by<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.970> new<00:01:37.240> batsman<00:01:37.630> or

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
Lehman was joined by a new batsman or

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.240 
Lehman was joined by a new batsman or
then<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.200> could<00:01:38.350> make<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> bit<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.890> difference

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
then it could make a bit of a difference

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.290 
then it could make a bit of a difference
in<00:01:39.430> mock<00:01:39.610> war<00:01:39.880> however<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.570> still<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:41.050> there

in mock war however is still out there

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.330 
in mock war however is still out there
now<00:01:43.300> then<00:01:43.539> did<00:01:43.840> they<00:01:44.050> cross<00:01:44.410> now<00:01:45.009> you've<00:01:45.220> got

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
now then did they cross now you've got

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.160 
now then did they cross now you've got

things in mind here where were the

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.590 
things in mind here where were the

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
third umpire to make a definitive with

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.750 
third umpire to make a definitive with
the<00:03:50.040> angle<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.400> parallax<00:03:51.290> law<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.769> guess<00:03:53.459> he<00:03:53.669> had

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the angle of parallax law I guess he had

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.969 
the angle of parallax law I guess he had
to<00:03:53.849> make<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.030> decision<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.629> it<00:03:55.470> looked<00:03:55.799> as

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
to make that decision but it looked as

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.160 
to make that decision but it looked as
though<00:03:56.010> Don<00:03:56.459> past<00:03:56.729> and<00:03:57.349> well<00:03:58.349> down

we should mention also that the umpires
the<00:04:08.920> middle<00:04:09.160> didn't<00:04:09.970> make<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.270> third<00:04:10.690> umpire

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840

well<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.060> mean<00:04:23.330> sure<00:04:24.169> they<00:04:24.350> didn't<00:04:24.590> make<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
well I mean sure they didn't make the

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.010 
well I mean sure they didn't make the
single<00:04:25.310> signal<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.030> they<00:04:26.180> did<00:04:26.360> ask<00:04:26.509> the<00:04:26.780> third

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
umpire there's no doubt about that and

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.850 
umpire there's no doubt about that and
we<00:04:28.850> know<00:04:29.090> from<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:30.020> television<00:04:30.410> point<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.770> view

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
we know from a television point of view

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.420 
we know from a television point of view
there<00:04:30.949> what<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.070> Serie<00:04:31.460> place<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.979> may<00:04:34.280> well

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
there what a Serie place so it may well

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.430 
there what a Serie place so it may well
have<00:04:34.580> been<00:04:34.699> that<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:35.600> third<00:04:35.810> umpire<00:04:35.960> thought

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440

it was too close to call benefit of the
doubt<00:04:38.270> goes<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.110> umpire<00:04:39.410> in<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.740> case
