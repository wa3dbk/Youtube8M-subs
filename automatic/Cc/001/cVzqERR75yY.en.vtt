00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just does wonders and these have a nice

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
just does wonders and these have a nice
combination<00:01:17.250> sole<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.390> call

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
combination sole is what I would call

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.130 
combination sole is what I would call
that<00:01:18.600> sole<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:20.009> far<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> tread<00:01:20.700> pattern

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
that sole of as far as the tread pattern

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
that sole of as far as the tread pattern
very<00:01:22.140> comfortable<00:01:22.830> these<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:23.520> eyelets

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
very comfortable these are two eyelets

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
very comfortable these are two eyelets
and<00:01:24.270> again<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> believe<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> brass

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and again I believe they have brass

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.200 
and again I believe they have brass
hardware<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:27.890> these<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> moccasin<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hardware there these have a moccasin a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080 
hardware there these have a moccasin a
double<00:01:30.630> sole<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.770> how<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> extra

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
double sole see how they see that extra

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.780 
double sole see how they see that extra
row<00:01:33.270> are<00:01:33.390> stitching<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.400> extra

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
row are stitching there the the extra

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
row are stitching there the the extra
leather<00:01:36.119> wraps<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
leather wraps around and then is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.440 
leather wraps around and then is
stitched<00:01:37.890> partway<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
stitched partway up there and you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.690 
stitched partway up there and you can
see<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> stitching<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> inside<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
see the stitching on the inside that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.490 
see the stitching on the inside that
that's<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.180> an<00:01:42.299> extra<00:01:42.659> piece<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> leather
