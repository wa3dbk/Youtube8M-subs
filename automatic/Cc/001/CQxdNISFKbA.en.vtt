00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.000
 good morning today we would practice cleaning 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.650
 aspiration correct aspirations 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.760
 of this golf with the stripes product 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:58.440
 trani clear from this tank 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.040
 use to insert the long straw 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.040
 inside the shelter 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 ok the tank clearly works too 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.180
 upside down ok so with machines so 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.250
 we're going to run this police 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 we have prepared a tank with the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 straw inserted in while you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.810
 we also succeed 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.520
 a little the dirt inside 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.920
 we keep in mind that it cleans in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.920
 this car is made every 10,000 km 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.990
 now we will start the car 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.340
 we see the gas at about 1,500 rpm 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.520
 as expected we recommend when 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.920
 let this police do a 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.840
 small revenue and leave 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.030
 rest the engine as you have heard 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.250
 we hear the morning and then yes 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.130
 it lowers means that the product is 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.620
 state 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.780
 clearly burned this product 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.610
 would have used the coupon is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.520
 clearly when we have a collector 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.640
 that to many Roma is very clogged 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.230
 certainly 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.930
 the best effect would be to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.840
 however disassemble it as maintenance like 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.940
 help in the police and cutting off at 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.490
 this truly fundamental product 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.840
 I would now kindly show you 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.000
 what we managed to do that us 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.310
 we give the butterfly completely devoid of 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.480
 every every so definitely the tribute 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:21.049
 gave excellent help to the police of 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.730
 light and everything is very important and not 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.660
 design also clean the lights of 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.580
 intake is clearly with the valves 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.360
 and yours was clearly more 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.970
 elasticity the machine power 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.200
 the important thing as I see long shirt 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.500
 be careful that it does not go into the 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.230
 collector always come 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.140
 two fingers the bomb works upside down 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.870
 so do a little disagreement and stop 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.760
 very calmly clearly if we send 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.650
 much produced within the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.630
 tonal machine because we increase 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.690
 clearly the carburetion of the 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.970
 machine so very cautiously there 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.710
 are no problems whatsoever 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.810
 we have the engine as we hear something 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.100
 that is wrong we are the finger and it stops 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.540
 all 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.460
 we also want to point out that this 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.960
 what we keep in maintenance and the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.880
 new then being careful is it 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.620
 amplifying oil washer e 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.320
 we want to point out that this is a 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.880
 vehicle at 120,000 kilometers that 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.880
 we can note 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:32.830
 121 thousand kilometers and with one 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.940
 proper maintenance and each coupon 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.680
 every 15,000 km bit of cleaning fault 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.540
 these products we have managed to reach 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 to a collector in these conditions 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.550
 without 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.830
 great grandis incrustations and therefore 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.070
 surely we have helped the life of the 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.670
 world 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.670
 thank you
