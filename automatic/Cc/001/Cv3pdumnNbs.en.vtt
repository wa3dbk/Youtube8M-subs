nursery<00:00:02.250> in<00:00:02.370> Boynton<00:00:03.210> Beach<00:00:03.240> that's<00:00:05.089> will<00:00:06.089> say

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
nursery in Boynton Beach that's will say

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.660 
nursery in Boynton Beach that's will say
lowly<00:00:06.540> nursery<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> guess<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.280> name<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
lowly nursery so I guess the name of the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.299 
lowly nursery so I guess the name of the
nursery<00:00:09.030> really<00:00:09.300> isn't<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.540> important<00:00:10.309> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
nursery really isn't that important the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.770 
nursery really isn't that important the
reason<00:00:11.550> I'm<00:00:11.639> making<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.120> though<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
reason I'm making the video though is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.499 
reason I'm making the video though is
that<00:00:12.990> they're<00:00:13.200> probably<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.639> number<00:00:15.299> one

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
that they're probably the number one

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.109 
that they're probably the number one
mango<00:00:16.440> production<00:00:17.070> slash<00:00:17.430> grafting

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
mango production slash grafting
facilities<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> United<00:00:19.410> States<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:20.460> just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
facilities in the United States I'm just

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.599 
facilities in the United States I'm just
making<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.380> assumption<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.890> think

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
making that a assumption but I think

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.830 
making that a assumption but I think
they're<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> principal<00:00:24.859> mango<00:00:25.859> producers

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
they're the principal mango producers

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.910 
they're the principal mango producers
certainly<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> state<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> Florida<00:00:28.769> which

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
certainly in the state of Florida which

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
certainly in the state of Florida which
kind<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> means<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.689> u.s.<00:00:30.689> anyway<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> wanted

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
ornamentals too they probably have about
