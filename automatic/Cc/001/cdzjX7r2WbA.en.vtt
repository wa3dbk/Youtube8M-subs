00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.680 

so<00:01:04.530> quality<00:01:05.530> packaging<00:01:06.360> probably<00:01:07.360> won't<00:01:07.540> get

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
so quality packaging probably won't get

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.120 
so quality packaging probably won't get
damaged<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:11.680> just<00:01:11.860> look<00:01:11.950> at<00:01:12.010> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
damaged so let's just look at the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.760 
damaged so let's just look at the

died<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> was<00:03:01.019> saying<00:03:01.260> before<00:03:01.319> there<00:03:01.980> are

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
died so as I was saying before there are

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.479 
died so as I was saying before there are
heat<00:03:02.400> sinks<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.120> cover<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.489> voltage

regulators and the RAM and that the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.819 
regulators and the RAM and that the
point<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.659> these<00:03:09.810> he<00:03:10.049> thinks<00:03:10.409> in<00:03:10.500> all<00:03:10.650> these

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
point of these he thinks in all these

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.430 
point of these he thinks in all these
elaborate<00:03:11.370> cooling<00:03:11.879> designs<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.200> they<00:03:13.290> can

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
elaborate cooling designs so they can

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
elaborate cooling designs so they can
get<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> most<00:03:13.890> out<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.129> overclock<00:03:14.819> that's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
get the most out of overclock that's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.699 
get the most out of overclock that's
what<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.659> suits<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.049> wants<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.620> do

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
what the suits really wants you to do

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.740 
what the suits really wants you to do
with<00:03:16.829> these<00:03:16.950> cards<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.609> they're<00:03:18.180> really<00:03:18.510> good

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
with these cards and they're really good

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.199 
with these cards and they're really good
at<00:03:18.810> doing<00:03:19.170> them<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.470> also<00:03:20.370> they<00:03:20.790> give<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
at doing them and also they give you

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.009 
at doing them and also they give you
their<00:03:21.390> software<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.079> doing<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.280> back

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.400 
their software for doing so on the back
you<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:25.190> two<00:03:26.190> DVI<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.909> display<00:03:27.750> ports<00:03:28.079> which

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you see two DVI to display ports which

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.819 
you see two DVI to display ports which
will<00:03:28.650> come<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.280> handy<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.700> affinity<00:03:30.829> for

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
will come in handy for I affinity for

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.839 
will come in handy for I affinity for
supplementary<00:03:32.430> power<00:03:33.500> there<00:03:34.500> are<00:03:34.530> two<00:03:35.310> 6-pin

power another thing I really like about
this<00:03:39.510> card<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.019> backplate<00:03:40.859> this

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
this card is the backplate this

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.030 
this card is the backplate this
backplate<00:03:42.269> will<00:03:42.419> keep<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.260> PCB<00:03:43.799> from

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
backplate will keep it the PCB from

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.000 
backplate will keep it the PCB from
flexing<00:03:44.519> it'll<00:03:45.329> also<00:03:45.480> reduce<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> PCBs

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
flexing it'll also reduce the PCBs

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.170 
flexing it'll also reduce the PCBs
temperature<00:03:47.430> by<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:47.910> two<00:03:47.940> degrees

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
temperature by one or two degrees

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150 
temperature by one or two degrees
Celsius<00:03:48.540> which<00:03:49.049> will<00:03:49.260> give<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.650> even<00:03:49.739> more<00:03:50.040> of

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
Celsius which will give you even more of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.979 
Celsius which will give you even more of
your<00:03:50.340> overclock<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.329> course<00:03:51.419> is<00:03:51.840> what

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
your overclock which of course is what

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.080 
your overclock which of course is what
we're<00:03:52.109> trying<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.379> do<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:53.280> these<00:03:53.459> cards<00:03:53.760> so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.250 

we'll<00:03:57.090> look<00:03:57.209> at<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.419> length<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:57.959> card

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
we'll look at the length of this card

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.309 
we'll look at the length of this card
and<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.790> full<00:04:00.329> tower<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.810> NZXT

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
and this is a full tower and NZXT

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.080 
and this is a full tower and NZXT
phantom<00:04:01.440> which<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.220> really<00:04:02.400> nice<00:04:02.549> case<00:04:02.910> by

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
phantom which is a really nice case by

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.849 
phantom which is a really nice case by
the<00:04:03.150> way<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:03.480> you're<00:04:03.660> willing<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.470> spend<00:04:04.650> a

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
the way if you're willing to spend a

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.520 
the way if you're willing to spend a
hundred<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.280> $120<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.540> definitely<00:04:07.440> would

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
hundred to $120 on it definitely would

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.680 
hundred to $120 on it definitely would
recommend<00:04:07.590> lots<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.190> cooling<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.669> stuff<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.980> I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
recommend lots of cooling and stuff so I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.909 
recommend lots of cooling and stuff so I
already<00:04:12.690> screwed<00:04:13.049> in<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.199> standoffs<00:04:13.680> for<00:04:13.829> the

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
already screwed in the standoffs for the

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.229 
already screwed in the standoffs for the
motherboard<00:04:14.160> which<00:04:14.430> will<00:04:14.609> be<00:04:14.699> receiving<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
motherboard which will be receiving a

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.710 
motherboard which will be receiving a
couple<00:04:15.419> days<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.910> it'll<00:04:17.910> end<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.239> right<00:04:18.570> around

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
couple days so it'll end up right around

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.069 
couple days so it'll end up right around
there<00:04:19.340> so

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
there so

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.790 
there so
right<00:04:22.650> there<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.129> as<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.789> can<00:04:23.879> see<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.620> back

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
right there and as you can see the back

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.260 
right there and as you can see the back
plate<00:04:26.069> stops<00:04:26.400> at<00:04:26.610> where<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.849> motherboard

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
plate stops at where the motherboard

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.210 
plate stops at where the motherboard
will<00:04:27.360> stop<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:28.050> PCB<00:04:28.500> keeps<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.099> then

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
will stop the PCB keeps going and then

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.610 
will stop the PCB keeps going and then
there's<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.460> secondary<00:04:30.120> heat<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:31.080> shroud

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
there's a secondary heat the shroud

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.939 
there's a secondary heat the shroud
keeps<00:04:32.490> going<00:04:32.789> on<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.110> pretty<00:04:34.319> long

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
keeps going on so this is a pretty long

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.899 
keeps going on so this is a pretty long
card<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.759> mean<00:04:36.419> you'll<00:04:37.199> need<00:04:37.349> lots<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.740> space

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
card I mean you'll need lots of space

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:44.360 
card I mean you'll need lots of space
you'll<00:04:38.909> need<00:04:41.750> probably<00:04:42.750> at<00:04:43.349> least<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.190> mid

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
you'll need probably at least the mid

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.730 
you'll need probably at least the mid
Tower<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:44.909> you<00:04:45.120> could<00:04:45.300> find<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.690> micro<00:04:46.650> ATX

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
Tower but you could find a micro ATX

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.760 
Tower but you could find a micro ATX
case<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.610> can<00:04:47.819> fit<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.259> also<00:04:49.259> another

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
case that can fit this also another

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.010 
case that can fit this also another
thing<00:04:49.949> about<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:51.060> exhausts<00:04:51.780> heat

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
thing about it is that it exhausts heat

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.559 
thing about it is that it exhausts heat
into<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> case<00:04:52.830> rather<00:04:53.220> than<00:04:53.639> completely<00:04:54.300> out

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
into the case rather than completely out

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.200 
into the case rather than completely out
like<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> reference<00:04:55.469> design<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.550> if<00:04:56.879> you're

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
like the reference design so if you're

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.080 
like the reference design so if you're
using<00:04:57.479> a<00:04:57.690> cramped<00:04:58.259> pretty<00:04:59.190> crappy<00:04:59.490> case<00:04:59.849> then

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
using a cramped pretty crappy case then

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.369 
using a cramped pretty crappy case then
I<00:05:00.180> would<00:05:00.240> definitely<00:05:00.659> want<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.840> recommend<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
I would definitely want to recommend a

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.180 
I would definitely want to recommend a
card<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.949> but<00:05:02.599> yeah<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:05.009> is<00:05:05.069> my
