dynasty and it's a salt-free shampoo and
to<00:02:01.470> be<00:02:01.560> honest<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.100> trusted<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> person

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to be honest I just trusted the person

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
to be honest I just trusted the person
that<00:02:03.090> recommended<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> meat<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.289> not<00:02:04.619> sure

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that recommended this meat I'm not sure

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.070 
that recommended this meat I'm not sure
exactly<00:02:05.369> why<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.179> good<00:02:06.330> thing<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:06.720> use<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
exactly why it's a good thing to use a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.199 
exactly why it's a good thing to use a
salt-free<00:02:07.440> shampoo<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> keratin

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
salt-free shampoo for a keratin

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.120 
salt-free shampoo for a keratin
treatment<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:10.380> guessing<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
treatment but I'm guessing that the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.949 
treatment but I'm guessing that the
keratin<00:02:11.549> treatment<00:02:11.940> works<00:02:12.180> better<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
keratin treatment works better if you

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.229 
keratin treatment works better if you
use<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.230> salt-free<00:02:13.680> shampoo<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.880> lasts

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
use a salt-free shampoo or that it lasts

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.590 
use a salt-free shampoo or that it lasts
longer<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.780> something<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.319> pretty<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.340> just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
longer or something I pretty much just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720 
longer or something I pretty much just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
strand without touching the south and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.130 
strand without touching the south and
while<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.639> my<00:03:11.670> hair

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
while I had this in my hair

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.820 
while I had this in my hair
who<00:03:12.500> know<00:03:12.650> there's<00:03:12.860> thermal<00:03:13.130> caps<00:03:13.580> on<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.910> and

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
who know there's thermal caps on it and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.680 
who know there's thermal caps on it and
throw<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.100> on<00:03:16.160> for<00:03:16.370> ten<00:03:16.580> minutes<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.150> then<00:03:17.210> I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
throw that on for ten minutes and then I

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.780 
throw that on for ten minutes and then I
chose<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.200> rinse<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.710> but<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.310> could<00:03:19.550> also

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
chose to rinse it but you could also

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.460 
chose to rinse it but you could also
just<00:03:19.910> leave<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.630> product<00:03:20.960> in<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.320> blow

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
just leave the product in and blow

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.150 
just leave the product in and blow
drying<00:03:21.740> but<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.460> felt<00:03:23.290> another<00:03:24.290> why<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.010> felt

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
drying but I felt another why but I felt

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.400 
drying but I felt another why but I felt
it's<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:25.970> bit<00:03:26.090> strange<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.870> just<00:03:27.110> keep

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
it's a little bit strange to just keep

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.470 
it's a little bit strange to just keep
this<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.890> when<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.280> blow<00:03:28.430> dry<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.030> chose

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
this in when you blow dry it so I chose

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.750 
this in when you blow dry it so I chose
to<00:03:29.690> rinse<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:31.480> then<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.510> blow<00:03:32.810> dried<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
to rinse it and then I blow dried it and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.120 
to rinse it and then I blow dried it and
after<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.820> had<00:03:35.240> blow-dried<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.260> left<00:03:36.710> it<00:03:36.980> for

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
after I had blow-dried it I left it for

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.580 
after I had blow-dried it I left it for
