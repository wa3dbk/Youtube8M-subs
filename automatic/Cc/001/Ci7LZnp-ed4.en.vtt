00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 the rails have been thrown 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200

 at that time perceive all indications 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.120
 so they can sign the lease today 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 for 4000 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.260

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.810
 that is a result 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.910

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.140
 the big four hours Cape Town and those to the 4 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.540

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.650
 if someone is constantly changing
