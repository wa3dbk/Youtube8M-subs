00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.360
 hello all the guys are the to whom 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.040
 give today we are here in this new 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.840
 useful videos and a little different than usual 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.840
 in fact it is a love video 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.460
 however I am standing so let's say that 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.949
 I can move a picture I want but 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.960
 try to sit still I decided to do 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.430
 this so just to change that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 I also wanted maximum to find new 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.260
 sticks that I bought camera 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.800
 now I'll show you this is this 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.800
 I have an idea is what work then me 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.249
 I ask how suggestive everything is because 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.559
 probably kind on occasions they were 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.319
 various we should register with this 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.030
 little thing ok guys so I would say that now 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.980
 we can switch to the globe software 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.719
 then the games week for those who don't 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.550
 knew dancing that a fair 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.460
 Italian video game and technology in 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.979
 general and is held in Milan every year 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.710
 this one does not already have the fourth edition e 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.820
 will be from 24th to 26th October then Friday 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.010
 Saturday and Sunday 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.960
 rightly understood we say more or 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.549
 less close to Milan there is an hour of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 land more or less so I decided to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.390
 go there with many of my friends 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.790
 so we are a group too 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.400
 great and therefore if you will be the in 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.110
 fair if you are around it is not worth the 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.180
 worth meeting we can meet 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 we can chat and e 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.560
 I don't know if you have any questions 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.820
 you can easily do that with me 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.830
 day I will go to games week 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.530
 I will go on Saturday when it happens to us 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.120
 all the major youtubers of the world 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.160
 will go and Saturday that is from what 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.190
 I have seen many many youtubers 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.080
 will go on Saturday then 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 intense even a very active stuff 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 so it's better to be nobody around 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.970
 VIP pass of any kind because I am a 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.700
 normal plebeian like all of you so me 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.990
 you will simply find yourself as a tourist 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.820
 obviously guys I can't do a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.090
 videos now to upload it directly to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.560

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.690
 arrived when he didn't arrive if I'm in 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 late if I'm not late but this 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.200
 I will of course write it on the page 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.770
 facebook so if you haven't yet 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.850
 go below in the description found 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.200
 the link on the facebook page 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.030
 go put a nice like us 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.770
 already more than a thousand I liked derivatives 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 a great pleasure and of course there 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.090
 morning to evening to afternoon e 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 all when you'll be en suite maybe 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.950
 I will post formentera images of the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.900
 states to write where they are where you can 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 find me where I eat where I do 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.550
 breakfast and as I know he will go there there 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.460
 Saturday morning then arrive at i 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.490
 more or less at 9 because I start from here l 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.830
 83 in an hour of which I will tell you then 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.600
 there is a more or less opening fair I will be there 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.760
 and only there more or less all day 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.130
 so you will find me all Saturday 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.720
 he has already said it but I repeat the concept 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.580
 so guys I would say we can now 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 pass arguments a moment on 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.720
 first of all channel in general 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.790
 thousands of 15,000 subscribers do not have 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.680
 could make a special because this 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.989
 weekend in the mountains and I didn't have time 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.180
 so as soon as I can maybe I'll do one 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.770
 special for 15 thousand not there 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.780
 I guarantee nothing anyway because these 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.640
 days I don't have much time to do 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
 a special video a video of pour 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.730
 jump a nice video a video voice 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
 we said with more commitment 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.440
 I honestly don't have kids yet 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.110
 a precise idea on how many videos will do 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.540
 week on how to handle very well the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.340
 channel is therefore always the rule if 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.720
 you have any advice write them below 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.670
 if you have new series 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.140
 if you have new and if you have things for 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.420

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.739
 below that makes me absolutely happy 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.019
 so guys say we can 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.760
 conclude here hurts me hugging 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.400
 for this thing in the end it is heavy 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.319
 thorn memories fixed and hurts me a dog 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.299
