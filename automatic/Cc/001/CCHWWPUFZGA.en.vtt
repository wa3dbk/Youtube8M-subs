there's<00:00:59.309> no<00:00:59.399> scruples<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.120> design<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.260> all

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there's no scruples and design it's all

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.899 
there's no scruples and design it's all
completely<00:01:01.769> smooth<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.210> can't<00:01:03.449> even
