opening your way for the top lane

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.340 
opening your way for the top lane
because<00:01:17.160> usually<00:01:18.120> junglers<00:01:18.690> like<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> focus

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because usually junglers like to focus

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
because usually junglers like to focus
early<00:01:20.130> game<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.460> top<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.510> snowballs

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
really hard and they don't have words so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
really hard and they don't have words so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.490 
then you can just start a red buff even
on<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.060> side<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.630> got<00:02:20.780> bottom<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.350> game

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
on this side and got bottom of the game

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.340 
on this side and got bottom of the game
or<00:02:22.220> something<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:22.670> that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
or something like that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.130 
or something like that
bottom<00:02:24.350> tends<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.160> more<00:02:25.600> water<00:02:26.600> controls

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
bottom tends to have more water controls

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.940 
bottom tends to have more water controls
and<00:02:27.500> complain<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.670> bit<00:02:28.790> trickier

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.560 

aatrox<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.160> really<00:02:34.550> strong<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> game<00:02:35.270> and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
aatrox is really strong on the game and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.030 
aatrox is really strong on the game and
you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.870> even<00:02:36.050> take<00:02:36.230> dorrance<00:02:36.590> play<00:02:36.800> that's

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you can even take dorrance play that's

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.100 
you can even take dorrance play that's
the<00:02:37.130> first<00:02:37.310> item<00:02:37.670> rather<00:02:37.880> than<00:02:38.120> under<00:02:38.900> smash

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
the first item rather than under smash

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.170 
the first item rather than under smash
at<00:02:39.290> em<00:02:39.410> because<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.430> have<00:02:40.580> enough<00:02:40.790> sustain

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
at em because you have enough sustain

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.800 
at em because you have enough sustain
with<00:02:41.360> your<00:02:41.570> W<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:43.280> works<00:02:43.520> is<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.239> bit<00:02:44.450> tricky

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
with your W it works is a bit tricky

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.540 
with your W it works is a bit tricky
compared<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> other<00:02:45.470> junglers<00:02:45.890> because<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
compared to other junglers because you

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.660 
compared to other junglers because you
can<00:02:46.760> never<00:02:46.880> be<00:02:47.000> full<00:02:47.510> HP<00:02:47.799> since<00:02:48.799> your<00:02:49.040> W<00:02:49.370> only

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
can never be full HP since your W only

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.970 
can never be full HP since your W only
heal<00:02:49.850> see<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.090> lot<00:02:50.299> when<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.720> are<00:02:50.840> under<00:02:51.049> 50%<00:02:51.500> HP

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
heal see a lot when you are under 50% HP

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.220 
heal see a lot when you are under 50% HP
but<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.180> your<00:02:53.269> passive<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.780> make<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:54.049> for

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
but you have your passive to make up for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.979 
but you have your passive to make up for
that<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.910> yeah<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.420> remember<00:02:56.660> that

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
that so yeah you have to remember that

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.740 
that so yeah you have to remember that
when<00:02:57.799> you<00:02:57.830> face<00:02:58.070> people<00:02:58.519> they<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:59.269> be<00:02:59.420> full<00:02:59.600> HP

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
when you face people they can be full HP

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.770 
when you face people they can be full HP
and<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:00.380> not<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.040> makes<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.790> like

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and you're not so that makes you like

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.930 
and you're not so that makes you like
you<00:03:02.930> are<00:03:03.019> at<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> disadvantage<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.160> most<00:03:04.880> of

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
you are at a disadvantage but most of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.460 
you are at a disadvantage but most of
the<00:03:05.030> time<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.299> fine<00:03:05.510> because<00:03:05.690> you'd<00:03:06.110> hurt<00:03:06.290> so

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
the time is fine because you'd hurt so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.000 
the time is fine because you'd hurt so
much<00:03:06.590> anyway

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
much anyway

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.570 
much anyway
that<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.489> beat<00:03:07.610> them<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.470> at<00:03:09.650> first<00:03:09.950> you

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
that you can beat them and at first you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.870 
that you can beat them and at first you
should<00:03:10.670> use<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.090> W<00:03:12.459> damage-dealing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
should use the W damage-dealing

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.539 
should use the W damage-dealing
thing<00:03:14.540> what<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.110> blade<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.320> called<00:03:15.739> blood

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
thing what if the blade is called blood

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.390 
thing what if the blade is called blood
price<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:18.410> some<00:03:18.590> extra<00:03:18.769> damage<00:03:19.010> and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
price and you get some extra damage and

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.460

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
after that when you go under half HP you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.790 
after that when you go under half HP you
should<00:03:23.690> use<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.989> healing<00:03:24.230> one

needs to be tricky the one who plays

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.990 
needs to be tricky the one who plays
better<00:04:04.440> will<00:04:04.800> most<00:04:04.980> likely<00:04:05.100> win<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:05.670> against

clean chowder's really no color play so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.670 
clean chowder's really no color play so
you<00:04:08.610> should<00:04:08.760> avoid<00:04:09.000> fighting<00:04:09.750> sin<00:04:10.080> chess<00:04:10.380> or

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you should avoid fighting sin chess or
