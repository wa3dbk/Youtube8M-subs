00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.420
 hello how about youtube friends this time 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 is I bring a video is where I'm going to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 teach two pages to download 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 apps videos background themes for 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.220
 your mobile devices whether android 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.129
 java and symbian windows ok 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.809
 well first we started that we 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.260
 we would go to a page that is very 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.550
 known that is area 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.409
 well we have here a first one that is the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 portal since we are here and we will choose 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.580
 for example what we want to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 professions games ringtones whatever 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.600
 themes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 for example games 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 Now what we are going to do here is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.780
 select the action category at each 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.980
 adventure what we want 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.790
 and we will choose the platform 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.690
 for example android 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.970
 java without good windows phone but in this 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.760
 part I give you a recommendation of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.300
 that if you are going to choose android you do not know 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.430
 I recommend so much because because if they choose 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.500
 a game for example not to appear by 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.360
 here what you are going to do is send them to the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.690
 igoogle play to download 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.060
 and then it is not recommended, therefore, better 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.800
 that case goals to good day downloading from 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.290
 there but on the other hand what is java if 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.440
 well and I think windows phone can be 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.810
 directly download files to your 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.959
 computer key and for example we 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.990
 we will take java 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.870
 and good to load the page 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.830
 to whom we will choose what are the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.760
 dispositives 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.680
 alcatel de q blackberry htc and motorola 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.650
 Nokia Samsung are good ends here 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.980
 we say what we want and for example from 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.980
 here 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.330
 and here we open that are the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 Applications 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.510
 good for example here we get what 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.360
 is fifa 14 here comes what is the game 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.630
 what is java game platform 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.290
 how much weighs 514 kilobytes for 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.740
 samsung this dimension category 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.540
 sports and we will only be in the name or 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.019
 whether they are in magic to be able to download 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.060
 and I will not give this page this page and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:16.050
 we will download now we will click 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.240
 we hope and we will give you in download 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.790
 and we waited by law for 211 seconds 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.720
 to be able to download it an existence 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 account you 're not going to expect anything explained that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.520
 there is also someone for your mobile 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.010
 but it is in an account and it is better and 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.170
 here they will give you save files but this one 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.210
 since canceled as you could see the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.310
 archive 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.160
 and good as it is selection what they are 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.250
 funds in the funds select the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.920
 dimensions of your part is motionless and so 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.390
 they do not know their functions of their mobile they 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.520
 they put in google they look for 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.520
 features of your mobile and it 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.920
 they install this their dimensions themes 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.490
 animations and videos 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.240
 we go to the next page that is 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.240
 my cellphone 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.330
 this feeling 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.520
 the inscription I will leave you in the 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.549
 link for these two pages so you do not 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.440
 they are looking for what we are going to do here 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.380
 We will search our device for 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.860
 example we look high here I am using 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.710
 a package when here in addition to the united 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 devices for example we made him 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.729
 but he's hungry of course that I 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.240
 like this person more because 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.409
 here the games apps do not 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.229
 they are necessarily going to send you to google 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.180
 but if there is a pressure for this that is 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.270
 google play download your apps 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.409
 likes and with the device that has been 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.849
 registered but passing by example 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.159
 here are these that you can look for 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.229
 themes thrones where there are applications of 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.270
 your play videos do not write stickers in 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.469
 cartoon drawings recipes us 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.469
 we will put applications 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.000
 and for example that here is 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.860
 these applications would come and they do not 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.090
 they are going to send you to google 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.760
 if you're not going to have 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.040
 for example this scheme of leigh ex jon 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.820
 brÃ¼ning 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.930
 well we give it to you and we click and you 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.050
 we will download 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.199
 it's like someone has some 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.840
 page you put in save file but 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.129
 here you wait 30 seconds three days in 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.330
 One account 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.550
 you will not have this 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.810
 the time here and other actions like 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.810
 send the device 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.610
 with the qr code and so you have in 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.009
 production an application for 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.639
 reading these codes and from there what 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.280
 You can change 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:05.950
 here we wait for the 7 seconds ok 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.950
 but we do not wait we hope we wait 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.419
 as you can see it is downloaded as 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.520
 downloaded gives us the option to open or 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:18.479
 good as you can see is a file 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:23.039
 applies weighs 16.1 megabytes and we 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:29.669
 we were in save accept to lose and that 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:33.110
 it would be everything since you the case 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.110
 device all 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.670
 if you liked the pages all this 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:42.280
 little hand up this 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:47.870
 comment if you have a problem I do not know 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:51.520
 and see you in the next and goodbye 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.520
 if not
