00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
oh yeah no matter whether we're

oh yeah no matter whether we're
meat-eaters<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.750> vegetarians<00:00:28.439> everything<00:00:29.160> at

meat-eaters or vegetarians everything at

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.859 
meat-eaters or vegetarians everything at
the<00:00:29.400> base<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.910> food<00:00:30.060> chain<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.689> eat

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the base of the food chain that we eat

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.850 
the base of the food chain that we eat
comes<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> plants<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> closer<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
comes from the plants the closer you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.049 
comes from the plants the closer you
look<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.940> magical<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:38.059> magnificent

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
look the more magical and magnificent

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.450 
look the more magical and magnificent
and<00:00:39.270> mysterious<00:00:40.110> something<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.250> our

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and mysterious something is it's our

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.690 
and mysterious something is it's our
problem<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.870> close<00:00:43.140> enough

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
problem that we don't look close enough

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
problem that we don't look close enough
not<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> problem<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> universe<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.500> not

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
not the problem of the universe it's not

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
not the problem of the universe it's not
the<00:00:46.829> problem<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> science<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> chemistry

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the problem of science and chemistry

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
the problem of science and chemistry
that<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:51.120> close<00:00:51.390> enough<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> when

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that we don't look close enough but when

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.279 
that we don't look close enough but when
we<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.160> close<00:00:53.430> enough<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.930> come<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
we do look close enough and we come to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.090 
we do look close enough and we come to
appreciate<00:00:56.449> what<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> chemistry<00:00:58.100> symbolizes

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
appreciate what the chemistry symbolizes

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
appreciate what the chemistry symbolizes
what<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.489> fact<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.350> always

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
what in fact it is then we are always

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.070 
what in fact it is then we are always
brought<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.870> into<00:01:03.870> mystery<00:01:06.080> and

brought down into mystery and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.420 
brought down into mystery and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
when we face climate change which is by

no means the first time in human history
that<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.260> has<00:01:13.409> happened<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:14.460> relationship

medicine during the 20th century has not
been<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.720> wholeness<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:39.250> been<00:02:39.580> about

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
been about wholeness it's been about

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.580 
been about wholeness it's been about
parts<00:02:42.239> it's<00:02:43.239> been<00:02:43.510> about<00:02:43.690> splitting<00:02:44.200> human

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
parts it's been about splitting human

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.400 
parts it's been about splitting human
beings<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:45.100> into<00:02:45.580> atoms<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> molecules<00:02:46.510> and
