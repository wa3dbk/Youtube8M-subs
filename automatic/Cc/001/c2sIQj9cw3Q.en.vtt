00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.350
 she 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.819
 she 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.699
 hello to all and welcome to several teams that will end up 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.020
 as the first step is from bandits cam 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.210
 in e who target the test for me a very good alternative in France 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.240
 so for those who do not know France while a software sound 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.469
 that allows you to make money 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.829
 the capture of video games on pc is more known 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.010
 the kiwi 6% very very resource intensive including e cpu and gpu 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 so success is also that we could do on horticulture 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.690
 so I looked for alternatives 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.110
 much lighter 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.870
 that would allow the help to capture similarly recent games without too much of 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.800
 troubles 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.770
 so we can not see that on the presentation 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.650
 before moving on 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.370
 to small sequences where was preparing on drops that have flows or 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.530
 it's a revolution 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.049
 it's quite similar in the presentation in France 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.670
 you have too long and general allows you to send the video logo will see 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.480
 finally docile defined 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.460
 so as for France it is better to select for his second hard drive 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 little bit their system on which you will do you install 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 yet good reason except and still win 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.750
 still quite enough 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 of premiums mostly favors a hard drive or assume fast writing 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.410
 a second video tab 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.930
 so there gold to and you set 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 a key to restart stopped there the capture 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.990
 some additional modules 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 a pause when capturing the cursor dosages on the screen 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.149
 choose the audio track so to polish lesson 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.500
 the main track to the high school track 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.440
 nice little detail compared to typing knows that you can add a logo 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.420
 directly on the video that was recorded 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 uncompromising in its opacity position 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.129
 the right setting so allow you 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.719
 to define a resolution 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.189
 up to the maximum size of your screen 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.430
 then define the sps so we offer you my services only 60 million a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.299
 problem if you click here and you change from 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.850
 teheran - 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.499
 you can go 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.569
 you just have to judge 150 places as you wish 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.119
 and if 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.919
 interesting this official compared to France is that we allow to 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.599
 sectioning a compression codec on the fly 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.980
 I was different to what the best for me is a chain 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.600
 shippagan 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.920
 and also thanks to that the team a quality of time compression for the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.759
 original photo video so there 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.729
 managed by for software or games 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.709
 basic can be put on his account keep there was no no 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.619
 compression 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.279
 you simply trust before being connected 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.739
 she is helped 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.209
 I believe that needs at home proposes to put 80% 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.039
 in me I tested without 80 years or 50 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.239
 here are fifty gigs a little difference 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.059
 gerra 80 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.619
 but it's not at all along 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.779
 the difference in quality 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.219
 compared to the second its% 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.540
 contest without a license in addition to this data people still a little bit there 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.919
 the software when capturing 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.919
 and then you have the finer sectioning transfers 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.219
 the type of audio format recorded 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.809
 so as I would say this is a sequence that makes the difference by 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:38.629
 three strikes 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.319
 it is this quality 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.679
 in this quality 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:43.859
 customizable 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.859
 with a little with a compression codec to fly 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.849
 so images are luxury and already seen 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.169
 the format what do you want 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.729
 to illustrate your image 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:59.099
 a key to be set could have repeated the screenshot 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.900
 with a certain timing so a second 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.939
 the safest 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.259
 event 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.659
 the spyder not to put the cursor on them on the image and the language to 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.659
 about it gives you the version of the cam 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.529
 so let's keep it but we do not see here what I'm doing has listed a caste 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:15.910
 here on target 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.200
 you can choose direct x open gl es which is sectioned by default which you 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.329
 allows you to record your games 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.889
 but you can just as selected stay on a screen that 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.039
 have closed 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.240
 so like you and doing what I'm doing right now inscribed does not break so 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.939
 by cutting night in quarters and on the screen what I did for you 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.999
 can see the software better 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.999
 the foal all of your screen 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.350
 say there is a tab that pops up because I feel that a caste is a 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.680
 angle fps so like to hit you can view the creation of your 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.259
 videos or save them 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.949
 and possibly blocked 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.020
 the fps so if you record a video 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.479
 at 60 fps you can not deny it 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.020
 the business is in the game 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.580
 surprise 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.840
 the speed of capture 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.569
 here we were listening we will go right away 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.569
 percent or her leave from where you're dressed to show that the 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.580
 catch quality 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.110
 and especially for the stability 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.139
 when you're at stake including four years of huge losses of fps 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.330
 the directory will propose tomorrow 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.279
 scorpa files saved for 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.719
 around two minutes of play that's about 800 100 megabytes in 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.270
 being 720p 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.620
 and% and the decrease in the time and order of 20% to 25% and for the 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.819
 quality% and type of material you own 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.819
 to top it off right away and the game cance accesses 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.589
 3 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.889
 she 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.110
 symbol of this label 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.110
 do 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.979
 indeed 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.599
 faure 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.430
 woerth 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.050
 3 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.430
 Why 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.430
 ap 

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.619
 but 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:49.949
 true
