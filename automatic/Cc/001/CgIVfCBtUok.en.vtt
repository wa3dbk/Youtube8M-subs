 only in the municipality of são 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 Paul has a very large relationship 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.010
 between the river cover and the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.010
 coverage of our perception 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.510

 tamanduateí river 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.890
 so we left there from São Paulo 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 entered the black creek mall 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 identified a street form that was her 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.470
 coming down after she spent one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.680
 flat part rise again that can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 means a shape of relief is a lap 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 where normally the water shall be 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 people went there to look at the mall 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.700
 meadows and blood and we doctor edge 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 managed to find the grotto of the bixiga 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.799
 the signs of the springs and saracura 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
 we see the luminosity of the place 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.610
 the exuberance of the forest to the volume of 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 kills that we encounter is an exception 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.829
 in this landscape the presence of an alley 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 people in place of permanent source is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.479
 easy to find the taioba for example who 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:58.530
 form and signaled at the source of the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.689
 saracura here is the end of river history 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.000
 that we started to notice there in 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.549
 up on that little girl on that line or 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.930
 either the same river is the same water as the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.910

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 under a way that nobody likes 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.710
 tamandaré and goes a little further for the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.240
 state avenue 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.700
 a lot of people go through this girl or 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.220
 You know there's a river in the middle of it. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.420
