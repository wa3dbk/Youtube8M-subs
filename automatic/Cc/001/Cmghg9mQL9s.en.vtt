00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.770
 good with aldo de nigris aldo tell us 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.149
 which represents for you to be called 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 again to the selection one 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.930
 important call and a 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.139
 important opportunity for you to be 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.340
 headline to the absence of oribe peralta 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.450
 obviously first very motivated is not 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.490
 very happy to be here again 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.310
 it hurts a lot when you're not called 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.070
 when you come to be considered 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.740
 you know that sometimes there are potholes 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.090
 but what he proposed was to continue 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.150
 working hard on my team 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.650
 get back to a good level and achieve things with 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.739
 my team to be able to take into account and 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.980
 well I was very happy to be summoned 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.780
 again and there is nothing left but to stay all 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.540
 here not to give the best for my team 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.020
 and give results what they are looking for 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.210
 and if you see it as an opportunity I do not 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.489
 you do not wish evil to anyone not be 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.080
 talking about oribe but the reality is 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.120
 that had been part of the picture 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.100
 owner of the chepo and then it does not count 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.860
 with if I tell you, I had to be 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.869
 always against the change has 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.330
 played play up on the bench and always 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.030
 2000 100% on and off the court 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.860
 supporting the group and I tell you opportunity 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 I do not think that when it's your turn 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.240
 you have to be a hundred and show that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.100
 that you're fine or then that's what 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.750
 I'm going to look for and well obviously like 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.289
 they say not regrettable the situation of 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.300
 uribe but but one always tries to 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.780
 be one hundred percent for any 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.490
 situation 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 greece you can get these three 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 elimination matches nine points 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.039
 that 's what we're going to look for not what 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.119
 let's look is what is being 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.200
 looking for the results have not been given 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.670
 but 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 the team has remained with good 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.619
 intense attitude and the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.079
 results and well very very brief but 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.030
 because they are eliminated by the champion team that 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.550
 feel after seeing the final 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 obviously sad not sad because 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 we wanted to be in another final more 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.830
 look for another championship but well I think 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.090
 that in front we had as saying the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.160
 champion team that did very well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.620
 things and I think it's well deserved the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.110
 championship they got to tell 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.120
 the hobby so that you have confidence what 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.030
 that we are going to deliver 100% 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.070
 always for our country for our 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 family our classmates and we're going to 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.610
 try to always give the best have not been 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.740
 given the results but I think this 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 It's a very coarse team that will take 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.310
 early healthy
