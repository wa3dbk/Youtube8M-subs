00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
 Produced by NOWNESS 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.420
 Ryan Hopkinson works 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720
 Kitchen magic 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.760
 We believe in oriental culture 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 The existence of ghosts 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.260
 Soul in the spiritual world 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.980
 Wandering around 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.860
 I call myself a kitchen chef 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.200
 Because I believe that I am from the spiritual world. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.020
 so so 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.120
 No difference with others 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.940
 I am just from there 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.860
 When I saw something like a flash of light 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760
 Creativity comes to mind 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520
 So I have to look for an angle 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.080
 Unique and unique 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.550
 Only in this way can we be unique 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.270
 Innovate 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 I try not to pick raw materials. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 Otherwise my thoughts and feelings will be suppressed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.630
 Imagination will be limited 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.800
 I try to use every dish. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 Vocabulary from Chinese dictionaries 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660
 The taste is very important in Chinese culture. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.760
 We value this very much. We will say how the food tastes. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760
 Not how it tastes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.130
 We have too many words to describe different degrees of brittleness. 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.970
 There is no corresponding vocabulary in English. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.140
 I make every dish 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.400
 All trying to produce stimuli are remembered 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.220
 I hope before putting food on 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.720
 Can inspire your imagination 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.680
 I want to take you away from safety. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.780
 Push to the edge of the cliff 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.080
 This is the meaning of "extreme" 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.300
 Push you to the edge of life and death 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.030
 Pushing to the edge of reason and madness 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.270
 Take you infinitely close to this edge but not let you fall 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 What an exciting experience this is.
