00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.840 
make around 1.5 to maybe one point two
ish<00:01:50.700> million<00:01:51.240> per<00:01:51.780> 100<00:01:52.229> keys<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.159> usually<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
ish million per 100 keys so usually and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.420 
ish million per 100 keys so usually and
I<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.450> mean<00:01:54.810> usually<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.799> walk<00:01:56.009> away<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I do mean usually you can walk away with

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.730 
I do mean usually you can walk away with
around<00:01:56.700> nine<00:01:57.149> million<00:01:57.450> profit<00:01:57.780> from<00:01:58.380> flipping

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
around nine million profit from flipping

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
around nine million profit from flipping
a<00:01:59.130> hundred<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.729> each<00:01:59.880> key<00:02:00.210> every<00:02:01.020> four<00:02:01.229> hours

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
a hundred of each key every four hours

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130 
a hundred of each key every four hours
so<00:02:02.070> making<00:02:02.729> nine<00:02:03.299> million<00:02:03.570> every<00:02:03.930> four<00:02:04.110> hours

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so making nine million every four hours

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
so making nine million every four hours
it's<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.040> decent<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.719> be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it's actually pretty decent and to be

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
it's actually pretty decent and to be
able<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> flip<00:02:07.259> all<00:02:07.439> six<00:02:07.799> hundred<00:02:08.069> keys<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
able to flip all six hundred keys it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.070 
able to flip all six hundred keys it
usually<00:02:09.300> takes<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:10.110> 30<00:02:11.099> minutes

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
usually takes around 30 minutes

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.920 
usually takes around 30 minutes
maybe<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.710> an<00:02:12.800> hour<00:02:12.890> also<00:02:13.430> keys<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.720> very

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
maybe in an hour also keys are very very

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.600 
maybe in an hour also keys are very very
common<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.820> they<00:02:16.820> do<00:02:17.290> become<00:02:18.290> overly<00:02:19.220> flipped

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
common and they do become overly flipped

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.640 
common and they do become overly flipped
at<00:02:19.850> some<00:02:20.150> point<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.960> some<00:02:21.140> points<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.530> might

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
at some point so some points you might

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.380 
at some point so some points you might
just<00:02:21.860> find<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.160> as<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> very<00:02:22.670> very<00:02:23.000> little

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
just find that as a very very little

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.900 
just find that as a very very little
margin<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.960> made<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> average<00:02:25.250> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
margin to be made but on the average you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.530 
margin to be made but on the average you
can<00:02:26.090> make<00:02:26.300> around<00:02:26.600> 1.2<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.350> run<00:02:27.470> 1.5<00:02:28.540> million

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
can make around 1.2 to run 1.5 million

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.090 
can make around 1.2 to run 1.5 million
profit<00:02:29.750> per<00:02:30.110> hundred<00:02:30.530> keys<00:02:30.740> which<00:02:30.980> is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
profit per hundred keys which is

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.670 
profit per hundred keys which is
actually<00:02:31.250> not<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.490> bad<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:31.910> all<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:33.320> this

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
actually not that bad at all in this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.340 
actually not that bad at all in this
video<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.100> actually<00:02:34.490> managed<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> make<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
video I actually managed to make on a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.890 
video I actually managed to make on a
hundred<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.950> keys<00:02:37.130> three<00:02:37.940> million<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.780> it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
hundred of keys three million so it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840 
hundred of keys three million so it
wasn't<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.200> bad<00:02:39.350> at<00:02:39.500> all<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.790> know

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
wasn't that bad at all just so you know

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.450 
wasn't that bad at all just so you know
in<00:02:41.180> total<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.810> made<00:02:42.020> five<00:02:42.350> million<00:02:42.650> from<00:02:42.950> just

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
in total I made five million from just

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.370 
in total I made five million from just
making<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:43.910> video<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.480> guys<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.930> I'm

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
making this video for you guys and I'm

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.050 
making this video for you guys and I'm
actually<00:02:45.500> pretty<00:02:45.710> happy<00:02:45.830> about<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
actually pretty happy about that it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.080 
actually pretty happy about that it
might<00:02:48.020> seem<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.770> lot<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.670> didn't

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
might seem like a lot but I didn't

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.250 
might seem like a lot but I didn't
invest<00:02:50.330> quite<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> bit<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.840> money<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.140> this

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
invest quite a bit of money in this

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.680 
invest quite a bit of money in this
flipping<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.090> invested<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.540> total

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
flipping I think I invested a total

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.410 
flipping I think I invested a total
around<00:02:54.080> 200<00:02:54.590> million<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.910> be<00:02:56.000> able<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> flip<00:02:56.390> it

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
around 200 million to be able to flip it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.120 
around 200 million to be able to flip it
so<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:57.020> can<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.170> we<00:02:57.320> were<00:02:57.410> 5<00:02:57.680> million<00:02:57.950> profit

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
so what can you we were 5 million profit

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.090 
so what can you we were 5 million profit
is<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.670> bad<00:02:58.880> at<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.380> but<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.620> able<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.890> flip

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
is not bad at all but to be able to flip

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.640 
is not bad at all but to be able to flip
or<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.390> able<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:02.840> these<00:03:03.020> Keystone's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
or to be able to do these Keystone's

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.949 
or to be able to do these Keystone's
effectively<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.610> strongly<00:03:05.330> recommend<00:03:05.420> you

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
effectively I strongly recommend you

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.750 
effectively I strongly recommend you
have<00:03:06.200> around<00:03:06.470> 50<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.980> maybe<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.580> hundred

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
have around 50 to maybe a hundred

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.330 
have around 50 to maybe a hundred
million<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.320> with<00:03:09.620> less<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.130> course

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
million you can do with less of course

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.620 
million you can do with less of course
but<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.610> strongly<00:03:10.910> recommend<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.480> have<00:03:11.600> a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
but I strongly recommend if you have a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.949 
but I strongly recommend if you have a
hundred<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.200> maybe<00:03:12.610> fifty<00:03:13.610> million<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.630> can

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
hundred to maybe fifty million you can

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.830 
hundred to maybe fifty million you can
do<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.350> effectively<00:03:15.740> flip<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> hundred<00:03:17.000> keys

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
do this effectively flip a hundred keys

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.140 
do this effectively flip a hundred keys
takes<00:03:18.320> no<00:03:18.709> time<00:03:18.890> at<00:03:18.950> all<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.880> be<00:03:19.970> able<00:03:20.030> to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
takes no time at all and to be able to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.030 
takes no time at all and to be able to
do<00:03:20.269> or<00:03:20.540> six<00:03:20.900> different<00:03:21.050> keys<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.739> might<00:03:21.860> take

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
do or six different keys it might take

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.430 
do or six different keys it might take
you<00:03:22.190> around<00:03:22.370> an<00:03:22.790> hour<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.260> got

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
you around an hour so if you have got

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.720 
you around an hour so if you have got
enough<00:03:24.590> money<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.950> do<00:03:25.070> them<00:03:25.220> all<00:03:25.340> at<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.580> same

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
enough money to do them all at the same

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.790 
enough money to do them all at the same
time<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.840> perfect<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.350> there<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.560> six

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
time and it's perfect that there is six

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.470 
time and it's perfect that there is six
keys<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.370> have<00:03:28.519> six<00:03:28.850> grand<00:03:29.269> exchange

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
keys and you have six grand exchange

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.290 
keys and you have six grand exchange
slots<00:03:30.050> it's<00:03:30.530> perfect<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.850> there's<00:03:31.970> no<00:03:32.030> reason

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
slots it's perfect so there's no reason

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.350 
slots it's perfect so there's no reason
for<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.660> not<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.930> do<00:03:33.140> this<00:03:33.170> item<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.090> as<00:03:35.090> usual

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
for you not to do this item and as usual

much need to know about these keys at
some<00:03:41.390> point<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.260> find<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.739> they

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
some point so you will find that they

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.630 
some point so you will find that they
will<00:03:44.030> by<00:03:44.390> faster<00:03:45.140> than<00:03:45.320> they<00:03:45.440> sell<00:03:45.800> if<00:03:46.100> that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
will by faster than they sell if that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.810 
will by faster than they sell if that
happens<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.300> wait<00:03:47.989> patiently<00:03:48.820> sometimes

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
happens just wait patiently sometimes

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.810 
happens just wait patiently sometimes
and<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.480> do<00:03:50.540> mean<00:03:50.810> quite<00:03:51.410> often<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.340> find<00:03:52.580> that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
and I do mean quite often you find that

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.300 
and I do mean quite often you find that
your<00:03:53.360> items<00:03:53.780> sell<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.440> lot<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.709> faster<00:03:55.160> than

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
your items sell a lot of faster than

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
your items sell a lot of faster than
they<00:03:55.430> buy<00:03:55.670> don't<00:03:56.510> ask<00:03:56.690> me<00:03:56.750> why<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.200> happens

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
they buy don't ask me why that happens

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.500 
they buy don't ask me why that happens
but<00:03:57.709> sometimes<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.250> does<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.850> if<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.360> does

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
but sometimes it does and if it does

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.080 
but sometimes it does and if it does
happen<00:03:59.690> just<00:04:00.110> take<00:04:00.530> advantage<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.100> it<00:04:01.310> buy

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
happen just take advantage of it buy

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.790 
happen just take advantage of it buy
them<00:04:02.420> as<00:04:02.570> fast<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:02.959> possible<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.500> try<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
them as fast as possible and try and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.780 
them as fast as possible and try and
sell<00:04:04.010> them<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.850> biggest<00:04:05.180> profit<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.690> can

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.490 
sell them for the biggest profit you can
so<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.000> question<00:04:08.209> still<00:04:08.720> stands<00:04:09.049> like<00:04:09.260> what

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
so the question still stands like what

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.160 
so the question still stands like what
happens<00:04:09.950> if<00:04:10.330> they<00:04:11.330> don't<00:04:11.360> sale<00:04:11.840> or<00:04:12.049> what

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
happens if they don't sale or what

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.440 
happens if they don't sale or what
happens<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.650> buy<00:04:12.799> up<00:04:13.010> 50<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.030> them<00:04:14.180> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
happens if you buy up 50 of them and

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.690 
happens if you buy up 50 of them and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
only half of them sell if that happens

it<00:05:17.229> you<00:05:17.680> would<00:05:17.770> lose<00:05:17.979> a<00:05:18.010> bit<00:05:18.220> of<00:05:18.280> money<00:05:18.490> from

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
it you would lose a bit of money from

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.700 
it you would lose a bit of money from
that<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:19.600> might<00:05:19.780> not<00:05:19.870> lose<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.080> lot<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:20.590> you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
that you might not lose a lot but you

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.290 
that you might not lose a lot but you
will<00:05:20.860> lose<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.070> bit<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.250> money<00:05:21.460> so<00:05:22.090> what<00:05:22.270> I

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
will lose a bit of money so what I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.909 
will lose a bit of money so what I
strongly<00:05:22.540> recommend<00:05:22.630> is<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.500> put<00:05:23.680> it<00:05:23.800> at

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
strongly recommend is you just put it at

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.890 
strongly recommend is you just put it at
the<00:05:23.950> price<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.250> bought<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.120> wait<00:05:25.630> for<00:05:25.840> it

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
the price you bought it and wait for it

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.350 
the price you bought it and wait for it
to<00:05:25.960> sell<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.530> should<00:05:27.520> take<00:05:27.729> about<00:05:27.880> 10-15

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
to sell it should take about 10-15

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360 
to sell it should take about 10-15
minutes<00:05:28.870> for<00:05:29.050> your<00:05:29.229> whole<00:05:29.380> lot<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.800> sell<00:05:30.070> and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
minutes for your whole lot to sell and

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.010 
minutes for your whole lot to sell and
then<00:05:30.460> to<00:05:30.580> buy<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.630> wouldn't<00:05:31.870> take<00:05:31.990> that

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
then to buy and so it wouldn't take that

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.490 
then to buy and so it wouldn't take that
