of thing we are doing the Seattle
obesity<00:04:40.889> study<00:04:41.130> which<00:04:41.729> has<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.120> do<00:04:42.270> with

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
obesity study which has to do with

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.830 
obesity study which has to do with
disparities<00:04:43.979> in<00:04:44.340> health<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.000> body<00:04:45.510> weight

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.710 
disparities in health and body weight
among<00:04:46.590> Seattle<00:04:47.099> communities<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.419> this<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.690> a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
among Seattle communities so this is a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.360 
among Seattle communities so this is a
project<00:04:49.020> where<00:04:49.740> we<00:04:49.770> look<00:04:50.010> at<00:04:50.130> where<00:04:50.340> people

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
project where we look at where people

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.420 
project where we look at where people
live<00:04:50.820> where<00:04:51.599> they<00:04:51.750> shop<00:04:52.020> what<00:04:52.800> foods<00:04:53.099> they<00:04:53.160> buy

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430

how<00:04:54.120> much<00:04:54.270> they<00:04:54.449> spend<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.139> what<00:04:55.710> their

how much they spend and what their

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
health and weight are as a result of

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.589 
health and weight are as a result of
that<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:59.280> it's<00:04:59.430> all<00:04:59.610> about<00:04:59.639> social

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
that so it's all about social

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.750 
that so it's all about social
disparities<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.560> making<00:05:02.370> sure<00:05:02.580> that

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
disparities and making sure that
