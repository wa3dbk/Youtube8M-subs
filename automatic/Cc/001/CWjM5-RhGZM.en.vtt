00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.890 
to look at your beam and start on the
left<00:03:11.889> hand<00:03:12.190> side<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.790> would<00:03:12.910> say<00:03:13.180> eight<00:03:13.450> is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
left hand side you would say eight is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.309 
left hand side you would say eight is
less<00:03:14.709> than<00:03:15.160> ten<00:03:15.730> or<00:03:16.359> eight<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.870> lighter<00:03:17.170> than

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
less than ten or eight is lighter than

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.720 
less than ten or eight is lighter than
ten<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.160> tell<00:03:18.370> because<00:03:18.489> why<00:03:20.730> it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
ten and you can tell because why it's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.370 
ten and you can tell because why it's
higher<00:03:22.030> right<00:03:22.480> it's<00:03:22.720> up<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:22.989> air<00:03:23.109> it's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
higher right it's up in the air it's

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.849 
higher right it's up in the air it's
lighter<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.370> 8<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.579> less<00:03:24.790> than<00:03:25.329> 10<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.989> 10<00:03:26.470> is

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
lighter so 8 is less than 10 and 10 is

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.670 
lighter so 8 is less than 10 and 10 is
greater<00:03:27.519> than<00:03:27.880> eight<00:03:28.209> it's<00:03:28.510> heavier<00:03:29.109> or<00:03:29.260> big

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
greater than eight it's heavier or big

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.080 
greater than eight it's heavier or big
