then from there we can launch
Thunderbird<00:01:30.070> one<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.120> thought<00:01:31.630> about

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
Thunderbird one so I thought about

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.660 
Thunderbird one so I thought about
emojis<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.290> little<00:01:32.590> bit<00:01:32.710> different<00:01:33.100> than<00:01:33.490> a

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
emojis a little bit different than a

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.340 
emojis a little bit different than a
Thunderbird<00:01:34.150> 3<00:01:34.300> but<00:01:34.660> it's<00:01:34.780> still<00:01:34.900> really<00:01:35.080> cool

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
Thunderbird 3 but it's still really cool

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.530 
Thunderbird 3 but it's still really cool
so<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.800> take<00:01:36.490> Thunderbird<00:01:36.940> one<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.330> you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
so you take Thunderbird one and you

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.590 
so you take Thunderbird one and you
slide<00:01:37.840> them<00:01:38.020> forward<00:01:38.050> into<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.070> launch<00:01:39.600> silo

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600
