good morning I'm mark Freeman with
Daniels<00:00:08.040> plant<00:00:08.250> food<00:00:08.490> I'd<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.389> tell<00:00:09.570> you

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
Daniels plant food I'd like to tell you

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.780 
Daniels plant food I'd like to tell you
a<00:00:09.719> little<00:00:09.840> bit<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.830> basis<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> Daniels

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
a little bit about the basis of Daniels

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
a little bit about the basis of Daniels
plant<00:00:12.030> food<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.929> based<00:00:13.200> upon<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.620> seed

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
plant food it's based upon a seed

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.720 
plant food it's based upon a seed
extract<00:00:14.639> which<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.949> backbone<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
extract which is the backbone of the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
extract which is the backbone of the
nutritional<00:00:18.390> source<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.260> plants<00:00:19.680> since<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
nutritional source for plants since it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
nutritional source for plants since it
came<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.490> plants<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.300> recognized<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
came from plants they recognized the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
came from plants they recognized the
seed<00:00:22.470> extract<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.670> their<00:00:24.060> own<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.420> found<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.840> way

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
seed extract as their own we found a way

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
seed extract as their own we found a way
to<00:00:25.050> pull<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> sea<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.430> give<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> back

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to pull it from the sea and give it back

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.859 
to pull it from the sea and give it back
to<00:00:27.570> them<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.400> gives<00:00:29.400> us<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.970> background<00:00:30.570> for

comparable and nitrogen to a 20%
nitrogen<00:00:43.260> fertilizer<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> very

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
nitrogen fertilizer because it's a very

per<00:00:49.140> gallon<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.910> means<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> 10%<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:52.020> volume

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.250 
per gallon that means that 10% by volume
by<00:00:53.190> weight<00:00:53.489> gives<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.719> pound<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
by weight gives you one pound of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.119 
by weight gives you one pound of
nitrogen<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:56.699> gallon<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.870> Daniel's<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
nitrogen for every gallon of Daniel's so

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
nitrogen for every gallon of Daniel's so
5<00:00:59.820> gallons<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> annuals<00:01:01.050> relates<00:01:01.710> directly

5 gallons and annuals relates directly

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.060 
5 gallons and annuals relates directly
to<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.460> 25<00:01:03.030> pound<00:01:03.390> bag<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.690> 20%<00:01:04.439> nitrogen

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to a 25 pound bag of 20% nitrogen

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
to a 25 pound bag of 20% nitrogen
because<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.479> 5<00:01:07.260> pounds<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> nitrogen

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
because it also has 5 pounds of nitrogen

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.030 
because it also has 5 pounds of nitrogen
so<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> compare<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.720> economics<00:01:10.380> with

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so as you compare your economics with

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
so as you compare your economics with
Daniels<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.270> first<00:01:12.479> check<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.080> cross
