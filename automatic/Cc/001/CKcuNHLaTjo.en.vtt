00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.240
 video I used this 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.230
 pupil enamel x 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.280

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.320
 with the base underneath and a pass 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.350
 and instead they are used for the nails of the little collection of pupa 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.680
 this loutato rose seems with the base under a pass the number 309 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.970
 then labyrinth university color I like it because in the other motorcycle hours used 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.940
 a color 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.570
 because from the eye that in phenomenal summer 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.160
 and instead on the Middle Ages used or a softer moment 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.420
 products that after the cocktail will be more extravagant and much more colorful 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 then as a color plan to outline my glass 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700
 with a florence brush 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.149
 if you want to see the movies you can use a dolphin or a pencil tip 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.689
 now I go to 15 and 29 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.890

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089

 directly from the brush of the opaque enamel dab the upper part 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
 the orange themes start of the glass 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.359
 to create a kind of sculpture 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.359
 film like that 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.289
 instead of using the sponge 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.009
 samp 1 slightly 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
 with the brush 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.959
