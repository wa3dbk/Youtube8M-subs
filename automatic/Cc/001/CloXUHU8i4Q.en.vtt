 victims is not exactly the same when 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.610
 we started the ritual there are three points 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.409

 First is to revitalize your hair 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.649
 second is to nourish and the third is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 repair is at the end once with 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.850
 dry hair when we finish each 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.680
 once with the treatment we will put the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 elixir last to give you that big dose 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.050
 of brightness that worries you so much about your 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 curled

 that is all you are going to solve what 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.220
 been but the last dose is going to be 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.220
 absolutely important 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.430
 I stand at this early stage what 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 let's do is remove with a big 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.250
 brushing all the impurities that you can 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.160
 have based on lacquer type products 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.990
 styling and obviously once 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 Brushing very brushing the hair you 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.080
 gives another clean view 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.520
 when you brush and start to stay 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.530

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.350
 symptom of 100% that you have removed 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.360
