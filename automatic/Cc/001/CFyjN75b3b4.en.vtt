plugs directly into the fan like so this

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.440 
plugs directly into the fan like so this
Pogues<00:01:23.110> directly<00:01:23.530> into<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.830> sensor<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.580> have

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
Pogues directly into the sensor and have

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.289 
Pogues directly into the sensor and have
sensor<00:01:28.840> written<00:01:29.080> on<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.610> then<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.119> have<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
sensor written on it and then you have a

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.990 
sensor written on it and then you have a
fuse<00:01:31.659> holder<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:33.070> then<00:01:33.340> goes<00:01:33.549> directly

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
fuse holder which then goes directly

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
fuse holder which then goes directly
onto<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.450> battery<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.670> will<00:01:36.909> switch

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
onto the battery now this will switch

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.950 
onto the battery now this will switch
the<00:01:38.470> thermo<00:01:39.040> fan<00:01:39.400> on<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.790> off<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:40.689> air
