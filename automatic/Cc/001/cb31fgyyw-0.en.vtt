a point like human players are with for
Titan<00:01:55.860> kills<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.219> worth<00:01:56.340> five<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> these

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Titan kills are worth five and these

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
Titan kills are worth five and these

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
grunts are worth in one so it definitely

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.330 
grunts are worth in one so it definitely
does<00:01:59.399> impact<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.390> score<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.829> not<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
does impact your score and but not in a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
does impact your score and but not in a
significant<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.960> way<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
significant way it's more of a way to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.210 
significant way it's more of a way to
keep<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.590> engaged

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
keep you engaged

having something to shoot at there

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.859 
having something to shoot at there
aren't<00:02:08.790> very<00:02:08.820> many<00:02:09.000> moments<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.600> titanfall

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
aren't very many moments in titanfall

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.260 
aren't very many moments in titanfall
where<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.770> running<00:02:11.070> around<00:02:11.340> without<00:02:11.970> a

purpose or just doing nothing I feel

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
purpose or just doing nothing I feel
like<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.990> also<00:02:16.140> eliminates<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.850> desire<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
like it also eliminates the desire to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.840 
like it also eliminates the desire to

another<00:02:35.220> remarkable<00:02:36.030> piece<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.080> video<00:02:38.040> game

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
another remarkable piece of video game

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.400 
another remarkable piece of video game
awesomeness<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:39.959> Titans<00:02:40.260> they

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
awesomeness right here these Titans they

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.550 
awesomeness right here these Titans they
move<00:02:40.590> fast<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.850> move<00:02:42.180> smooth<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:43.410> have

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
move fast they move smooth they have

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.290 
move fast they move smooth they have
multiple<00:02:44.190> things<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.270> be

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
multiple things going on and it would be

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.660 
multiple things going on and it would be
impossible<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.990> detail<00:02:46.860> everything<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.490> one

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
impossible to detail everything in one

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
impossible to detail everything in one
video<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.270> basically<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:49.560> Titan<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
video so basically your Titan as a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
video so basically your Titan as a
primary<00:02:50.160> weapon<00:02:50.580> which<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.060> my<00:02:51.180> chain<00:02:51.450> gun<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
primary weapon which is my chain gun and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
primary weapon which is my chain gun and
your<00:02:52.410> Titan<00:02:52.650> has<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> secondary<00:02:53.160> fire<00:02:53.430> which<00:02:53.640> I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
your Titan has a secondary fire which I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
your Titan has a secondary fire which I
have<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> rockets<00:02:54.390> on<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.780> right<00:02:55.020> bumper<00:02:55.230> right

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
have a rockets on on right bumper right

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.060 
have a rockets on on right bumper right
now<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.160> sort<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.820> tactical

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
now and you have sort of a a tactical

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.170 
now and you have sort of a a tactical
secondary<00:02:59.070> type<00:02:59.490> thing<00:02:59.700> which<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.880> this

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
secondary type thing which is this

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.090 
secondary type thing which is this
shield<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.350> vortex<00:03:01.740> shield<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
shield and it's a vortex shield that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100 
shield and it's a vortex shield that
absorbs<00:03:02.190> bullets<00:03:02.880> then<00:03:03.030> fires<00:03:03.420> them<00:03:03.750> back

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
absorbs bullets then fires them back

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.710 
absorbs bullets then fires them back
Titans<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.709> also<00:03:04.920> dash<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.240> mail<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
Titans can also dash they can mail a

Titans can also dash they can mail a
they<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.050> sprint<00:03:07.500> they're<00:03:08.300> basically<00:03:09.300> an

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
sense of awkward clumsy controls in some

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.160 
sense of awkward clumsy controls in some
ways<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.450> super<00:03:27.810> sized<00:03:27.989> to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
ways it's like you just super sized to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.900 
ways it's like you just super sized to
yourself<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.680> now<00:03:29.100> are<00:03:29.280> moving<00:03:29.580> around<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
yourself and now are moving around the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.790 
yourself and now are moving around the
battle<00:03:30.209> film<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.480> flow<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.080> game<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.560> very

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
battle film the flow of the game is very

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.320 
battle film the flow of the game is very
interesting<00:03:32.400> because<00:03:32.519> what<00:03:32.790> seems<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.180> happen

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
interesting because what seems to happen

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.240 
interesting because what seems to happen
is<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:34.019> people<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> couple<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.040> foot

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
is that people go for a couple of foot

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.460 
is that people go for a couple of foot
kills<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.019> Titan<00:03:37.380> is

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
kills because how you get your Titan is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.920 
kills because how you get your Titan is
based<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.190> how<00:03:38.370> many<00:03:38.430> pills<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:39.120> not

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
based on and how many pills you get not

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.210 
based on and how many pills you get not
in<00:03:40.019> terms<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.350> kill<00:03:40.530> streak<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:40.890> rather<00:03:41.070> a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
in terms of a kill streak but rather a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.890 
in terms of a kill streak but rather a
timer<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.180> your<00:03:42.330> timer<00:03:42.540> starts<00:03:42.900> off

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
timer and so your timer starts off

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.229 
timer and so your timer starts off
hi<00:03:44.530> number<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.519> three<00:03:45.849> minutes<00:03:46.030> or

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
hi number like three minutes or

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.490 
hi number like three minutes or
something<00:03:46.450> like<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.750> every<00:03:47.140> kill<00:03:47.349> you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
something like that and every kill you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.580 
something like that and every kill you
get<00:03:47.680> every<00:03:48.579> damage<00:03:49.150> point<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.319> deal

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
get every damage point that you deal

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.330 
get every damage point that you deal
lowers<00:03:51.280> your<00:03:51.549> countdown<00:03:52.510> timer<00:03:53.099> at<00:03:54.099> some

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
lowers your countdown timer at some

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.710 
lowers your countdown timer at some
level<00:03:54.579> maybe<00:03:54.700> it's<00:03:54.849> 12<00:03:55.090> seconds<00:03:55.450> maybe<00:03:55.569> it's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
level maybe it's 12 seconds maybe it's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.360 
level maybe it's 12 seconds maybe it's
30<00:03:56.019> for<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> full<00:03:56.560> kill<00:03:56.799> maybe<00:03:57.010> it's<00:03:57.189> two

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
30 for a full kill maybe it's two

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.039 
30 for a full kill maybe it's two
seconds<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.269> you're<00:03:58.360> dropping<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.810> timer

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
seconds but you're dropping that timer

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.110 
seconds but you're dropping that timer
down<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.560> then<00:03:59.680> titanfall<00:04:00.159> happens<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.879> drop

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
down and then titanfall happens you drop

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.759 
down and then titanfall happens you drop
your<00:04:01.269> Titan<00:04:01.569> in<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.049> then<00:04:02.170> everyone<00:04:02.500> kind<00:04:02.709> of

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
your Titan in and then everyone kind of

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.270 
your Titan in and then everyone kind of
just<00:04:02.950> smashes<00:04:03.700> at<00:04:04.329> each<00:04:04.540> other<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.079> this

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
just smashes at each other so it's this

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.949 
just smashes at each other so it's this
opening<00:04:06.280> moment<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.790> quiet<00:04:07.239> where<00:04:07.599> people<00:04:07.870> are

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.939 
Titan another one falls in two more drop
in<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.180> you've<00:04:19.299> got<00:04:19.479> this<00:04:19.930> massive<00:04:20.380> battle

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
in and you've got this massive battle

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.420 
in and you've got this massive battle
region<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.389> me<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:23.440> me<00:04:23.680> takes<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
region and that to me to me takes the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.640 
region and that to me to me takes the
parts<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.910> people<00:04:25.240> like<00:04:25.479> from<00:04:26.350> something

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
parts that people like from something

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.320 
parts that people like from something
like<00:04:26.680> battlefield<00:04:27.370> where<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.639> has<00:04:27.760> more<00:04:27.970> epic

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
like battlefield where it has more epic

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.050 
like battlefield where it has more epic
vehicle<00:04:28.750> combat<00:04:29.430> along<00:04:30.430> with<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.760> parts

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
vehicle combat along with the parts

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.810 
vehicle combat along with the parts
people<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.510> about<00:04:31.720> call<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.960> duty<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.320> more

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
people like about call of duty a more

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.029 
people like about call of duty a more
contained<00:04:33.820> map<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.510> sort<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.590> faster

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
contained map and sort of that faster

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.010 
contained map and sort of that faster
feel<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.729> think<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.630> creates<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
feel and I think just creates a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.320 
feel and I think just creates a
beautiful<00:04:38.470> mixture<00:04:39.160> because<00:04:39.550> at<00:04:39.669> no<00:04:39.910> point<00:04:40.150> do

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
beautiful mixture because at no point do

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.480 
beautiful mixture because at no point do
you<00:04:40.389> feel<00:04:40.599> like<00:04:41.229> you're<00:04:41.380> totally<00:04:41.680> useless<00:04:42.130> as

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
you feel like you're totally useless as

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.490 
you feel like you're totally useless as
a<00:04:42.550> pilot<00:04:43.240> which<00:04:43.630> is<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.930> human<00:04:44.199> control

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
a pilot which is the human control

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.279 
a pilot which is the human control
character<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.889> am<00:04:45.099> now<00:04:45.280> or<00:04:45.639> as<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.479> Titan<00:04:47.169> they

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
character I am now or as a Titan they

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.710 
character I am now or as a Titan they
both<00:04:47.530> seem<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.949> serve<00:04:48.160> equally<00:04:49.090> good<00:04:49.240> purposes

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
both seem to serve equally good purposes

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.529 
both seem to serve equally good purposes
and<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:49.960> think<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.260> game<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:51.370> as<00:04:51.520> fun<00:04:51.550> in

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
and I think the game is just as fun in

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.830 
and I think the game is just as fun in
the<00:04:53.320> role<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.889> human<00:04:54.430> soldier<00:04:54.849> as<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.360> in

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
the role of a human soldier as it is in

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.450 
the role of a human soldier as it is in
the<00:04:55.990> role<00:04:56.169> of<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.380> Titan<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:56.830> some<00:04:56.979> ways<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.220> like

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
the role of a Titan in some ways I like

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.860 
the role of a Titan in some ways I like
being<00:04:57.699> on<00:04:57.940> foot<00:04:58.270> better<00:04:58.419> because<00:04:58.720> that

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
being on foot better because that

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.629 
being on foot better because that
movement<00:04:59.229> is<00:04:59.320> so<00:04:59.500> speedy<00:04:59.830> you<00:05:00.099> can<00:05:00.400> jump

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
movement is so speedy you can jump

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
a Call of Duty or battlefield but

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.800 
a Call of Duty or battlefield but
anyways<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:42.639> battle<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.090> Titans<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.599> very

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
anyways the battle the Titans is very

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.909 
anyways the battle the Titans is very
interesting<00:05:44.199> because<00:05:44.289> it<00:05:44.500> becomes<00:05:44.800> very

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
interesting because it becomes very

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.320 
interesting because it becomes very
tactful

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
tactful

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.839 
tactful
it's<00:05:46.599> not<00:05:46.750> just<00:05:46.840> going<00:05:47.229> there<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.830> go<00:05:48.310> ham<00:05:48.610> I

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
it's not just going there and go ham I

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.390 
it's not just going there and go ham I
almost<00:05:49.389> thought<00:05:49.569> it<00:05:49.689> would<00:05:49.780> be<00:05:49.840> more<00:05:49.990> like<00:05:50.199> a

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
almost thought it would be more like a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.589 
almost thought it would be more like a
supercharged<00:05:51.400> kill<00:05:51.669> street<00:05:51.939> where<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.270> get

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
supercharged kill street where you get

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.450 
supercharged kill street where you get
the<00:05:52.720> Titan<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.139> then<00:05:53.259> just<00:05:53.439> go<00:05:53.620> get<00:05:53.770> 15<00:05:54.220> kills

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
the Titan and then just go get 15 kills

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.920 
the Titan and then just go get 15 kills
you<00:05:54.610> know<00:05:54.699> it's<00:05:54.879> actually<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.539> lot<00:05:56.169> more<00:05:56.530> um<00:05:57.930> you

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
you know it's actually a lot more um you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.300 
you know it's actually a lot more um you
have<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.080> be<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.169> lot<00:05:59.319> more<00:05:59.349> well<00:05:59.770> planned<00:06:00.129> and

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
have to be a lot more well planned and

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.619 
have to be a lot more well planned and
well<00:06:00.490> thought-out<00:06:00.729> than<00:06:00.879> that<00:06:01.240> because<00:06:01.419> your

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
well thought-out than that because your

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.659 
well thought-out than that because your
Titan<00:06:01.960> if<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.409> loses<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.919> shield<00:06:03.310> it's<00:06:03.520> gonna

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
Titan if it loses that shield it's gonna

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.640 
Titan if it loses that shield it's gonna
drop<00:06:04.090> its<00:06:04.330> help<00:06:04.569> very<00:06:04.870> quickly<00:06:05.169> so<00:06:05.409> you<00:06:05.439> may

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
drop its help very quickly so you may

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.869 
drop its help very quickly so you may
need<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.889> dash<00:06:06.129> out<00:06:06.310> of<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.520> way<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:06.789> they

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
need to dash out of the way and they

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.059 
need to dash out of the way and they
smartly<00:06:07.270> integrated<00:06:07.780> cooldown<00:06:08.620> timers<00:06:09.039> for

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
smartly integrated cooldown timers for

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.550 
smartly integrated cooldown timers for
your<00:06:09.400> secondary<00:06:09.759> tag<00:06:10.060> for<00:06:10.689> your<00:06:10.930> dash<00:06:11.229> isn't

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
your secondary tag for your dash isn't

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.709 
your secondary tag for your dash isn't
it<00:06:11.740> all<00:06:11.919> feels<00:06:12.340> like<00:06:12.610> it's<00:06:12.909> been<00:06:13.180> balanced

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
it all feels like it's been balanced

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.719 
it all feels like it's been balanced
really<00:06:14.169> good<00:06:14.409> i<00:06:14.439> know<00:06:14.590> this<00:06:14.800> is<00:06:14.860> technically<00:06:15.639> a

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
really good i know this is technically a

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.309 
really good i know this is technically a
beta<00:06:16.030> for<00:06:16.300> the<00:06:16.389> most<00:06:16.569> part<00:06:16.719> i'd<00:06:16.870> assume<00:06:17.169> they

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
beta for the most part i'd assume they

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.740 
beta for the most part i'd assume they
have<00:06:17.469> the<00:06:17.620> game<00:06:17.849> pretty<00:06:18.849> locked<00:06:19.300> down<00:06:19.569> and<00:06:19.690> i

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
have the game pretty locked down and i

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.570 
have the game pretty locked down and i
think<00:06:20.020> they<00:06:20.440> have<00:06:20.590> done<00:06:20.919> a<00:06:20.949> great<00:06:21.129> job<00:06:21.280> of

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
think they have done a great job of

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.899 
think they have done a great job of
keeping<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.479> titan<00:06:22.900> verse<00:06:23.379> pilot<00:06:24.009> action

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
keeping the titan verse pilot action

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.330 
keeping the titan verse pilot action
pretty<00:06:25.539> fair<00:06:26.259> of<00:06:26.500> course<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.800> Titans<00:06:27.069> have<00:06:27.190> an

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
pretty fair of course the Titans have an

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.219 
pretty fair of course the Titans have an
advantage<00:06:27.610> but<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.360> still<00:06:28.569> can<00:06:28.690> do<00:06:28.780> damage<00:06:29.110> as

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
advantage but you still can do damage as

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.980 
advantage but you still can do damage as
a<00:06:29.680> pilot<00:06:30.340> because<00:06:30.849> you<00:06:31.090> have<00:06:31.240> other<00:06:31.419> things<00:06:31.659> at

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
a pilot because you have other things at
