Hi, this is Norma for Splitcoaststampers.
In this video I'm going to show you how to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
make a Pop-Up Book Card. This is the finished
card. When you open it there is a pop-up features

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that looks like a book, created by all these
valley and mountain folds. For this card I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
colored 2 images from Magnolia stamps. The
sentiments were computer-generated. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The papers I've used are from a Pink Paislee paper pad called Noel. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120
Embellishments were created using various dies and punches,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 except for the pinecones - those are real tiny pinecones. Let's get started.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.979
You need two pieces of paper, a plain cardstock of 6" x 12"

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.880
 and a designer or patterned cardstock
of 5 7/8" x 12". 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.000
This needs to be of cardstock quality, about the same weight as your plain one. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.039
Place your cardstock on your score board.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.501
Score at 6", fold, and then put aside.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.120
On the patterned cardstock, we want to make

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.200
a cut line at the top and bottom of the paper, 1" from the edge and from 2" to 10". 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.000
You can do this with a paper trimmer, but I'm going to use my ruler and a pencil and craft knife.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:09.280
We're going to create the score lines for
the valley folds first. Place your paper upside

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:22.080
down on the score board. On the 1" strips at the top and bottom, score at 4" and 8" from the edge to the cut line.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.800
 In the middle section, score at 2", 6", and 10", between the cut lines.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
For your mountain folds, turn the paper
right side up and on the 1" strips, at the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.040
top and bottom, score this time at 6" and
in the middle section score between the cut

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.240
lines again, this time at 2 3/4" and 9 1/4".

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.000
If you place your patterned cardstock onto the plain cardstock and center it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 you can see that there is a thin border at the top and bottom 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but because both papers are 12"
wide, there is no border at the sides. 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.880
What we want to do is create a similar border there
by slicing off 1/16" on both ends.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.000
Now we can go ahead and fold along the score lines.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now apply glue to the left and right panels.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.880
Cut out a piece of designer paper 5 7/8" square,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.680
and adhere it to the card front. 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.160
Now you can
finish decorating the rest of the card.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.080
Here is the finished card.
