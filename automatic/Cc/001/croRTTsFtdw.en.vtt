 Hello, I want to show decor Chick 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.580
 salon on the VAZ 2110 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 Here is such a equipment we can 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 stop review in more detail 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 what is included here 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 especially pay attention to this one 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 the element will understand the approach or 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 don't fit solo changed several times 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 so pay attention to match 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.989
 keep the instruction true in Polish 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.050
 language air is nothing complicated no more 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 describe in detail the comments light we have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.090
 under carbon 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.149
 now open let's see worn here 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.750
 such here it is already but it's time for the oil fox 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.329
 that is, on the gyrfalso hide layer 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.460
 need to remove and stick you on the car 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:04.949
 flyer 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:08.090
 one carbon color 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.090
 millimeter 3 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.280
 the casino is not just an imitation plenochka 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.280
 pretty and beautiful 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.430
 Here is this element about which he said 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.049
 there is a look at the number of separation 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 at least we are here all beard in general 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.289
 compare with what you have in the car 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.039
 glues pretty easy war in this 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.429
 nothing looks very beautiful here 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.880
 in these elements the window is transparent here 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.649
 seen what that is on the substrate which there 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.649
 numbers or whatever you have there to be everything 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.399
 seen by the handles go with us where we have 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.149
 no buttons 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.549
 if I donâ€™t have them in general, I think everything is clear 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:04.179
 thank you all to look further on our 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.179
