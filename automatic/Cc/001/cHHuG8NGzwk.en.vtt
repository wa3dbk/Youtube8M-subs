00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.360
 the company telefonica again 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.590

 we are close to that soon e plus and base 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.140
 Also, it will be even available 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.150
 the rumors rum that it could be 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.489
 that you do not book extra postponed 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 must to lte to receive but that 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.740
 directly admitted to all contracts 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.360
 is reported several times 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.820
 about the possible merger of e 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.620
 however, plus and o2 still stands 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.120
 to the debate whether this merger 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.340
 non-competitive problems 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.290
 The Federal Cartel Office could pay 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.760

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.710
 Review of this merger 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.400
 not left to the eu commission 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.590

 unlikely, however, you know 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.920
 really not what is going to happen 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.990
 The two should merge together 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.070
 it could be that they are frequencies 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.900
 have to cede 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.240
 and that would mean that it would be 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.190
 could that be a new mobile service provider 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.960
