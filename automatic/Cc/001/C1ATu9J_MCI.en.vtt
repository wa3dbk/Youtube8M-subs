00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.580
 twice a week sometimes with the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.509
 The quota is field class but in most 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.090
 Sometimes you look there it was morning and 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.680
 meat thing what were the days of the week 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.820
 who loves and fifth and because he did not have 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 every day 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 claimed that because it is not the whole line 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 workload of the teacher could stand aa 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.160
 that they were 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 integral and to the right and these bathrooms 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.579
 that they did not have is because you will have a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.579
 place to take a shower 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 the right place in the right place in the bathroom 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 Children What has changed for you with 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 this integral 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.650
 we have more knowledge of things 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 but when someone who goes to want 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.009
 practically does not have much because 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.799
 has now as it is because we have the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.380
 things never able to use it 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.270
 do not know how to use then you have 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.259
 Sometimes we know but was not being 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.670
 well done and this stuff so he 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.850
 It was as saved time these 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.850
 integral boxes in the past 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.299
 I did not have the theory of how 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.840
 use the laboratory and this year of 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:54.850
 2009 started because you started to 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 use when exactly now May 10 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:04.829
 This week at home 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:08.799
 and you have been used in some projects 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.599
 it was not as often and even 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 because the laboratory could not handle the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.330
 people always stay there because they do not have 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.730
 employee stay inside 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:29.709
 how was this process started? 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 finally she left with materials but 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.060
 but the school did not provide any that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 You could complain to take it to 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.750
 assemble the laboratories because the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:46.200
 provided the laboratory does not 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.130
 it was more that we decided to mobilize 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:57.459
 to help the teacher use the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.790
 laboratory has things can not 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:16.750
 to use because this is in the box people 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:19.120
 is afraid to fiddle with cheerful things 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:31.299
 It's Alexis Sanchez 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:35.560
 we are also complicated because 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.530
 You need someone research price 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.840
 will search them right alex alex the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.329
 the ropes that were going to arrive have some promise 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.319
 What are they going to say says they lack the 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:52.049
 money to buy but few are 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.209
 integrals must be passed to 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.939
 lack money 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.310
 how do you understand the integral of 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.959
 morning and afternoon 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.900
 without being able to use all the possibilities 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.239
 that this whole class and would do well 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.209
 tired does not have student who gives pro chile 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.319
 does not get too tiring theoretical 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:17.489
 morning in theory believed in you think 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.009
 that for example is the people who listen 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.430
 Talk like that, noronha has a full class. 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.650
 the students do not have integral work and you 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:33.060
 knowing that you spend every day without 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:40.650
 Consent that you have great 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:43.500
 The school has been doing school here on the island. 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.669
 should be the mobilization of 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.669
 teachers and community 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:05:00.509
 complained about the album missing any of the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.370
 people can if you can talk about is 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.490
 governor who are very far from 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.860
 distance image 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.349
 if you could take advantage of this 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.099
 opportunity to speak with the governor 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:15.120
 which is the largest output manager that could 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.409
 tell him 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.020
 in relation to the reality that you are 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:24.659
 telling in school that you study what 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.210
 it is not the perfect role to send the 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.210
 continent with many things
