00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.989

 that what they bring is just a smooth silky 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.309

 tangerine on the lips and turquoises 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.049
 eyeliner looks very well practically 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.369
 is in the models the inspiration was 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.369
 call of eagle when 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.510
 It is very futuristic and I am very emotional 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.300
 for this light because we are using a 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.400
 iron instead of a golden laugh this is 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.100
 very exciting because it's about making 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.160
 a drying showed using products 13 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.110
 months we are using the same 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.119
 luminescent that gives you the volume and 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.550
 prevents any damage and at the tips 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.619
 We are using free mud is a new 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.600
 line that the ladies and is a strange and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.850
 protected from the heat then when we 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.130
 we were t2 today passing an iron on 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.960
 small sections with the tractor for 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is more graphic and daring 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 simply 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.670
 you can not say what trend comes with 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.799
 hair and not spring this spring 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.659
 actually what comes is the hair 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.640
 natural I feel that with all the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.920
 trends that we see with so many details 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.789
 lots of patterns and patterns 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.130
 color blocking 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.469
 I think the hair will take a second 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.179
 flat with all this is about no 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.159
 compete with all the trends that 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.929
 we are looking at clothes so just use 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.129
 products that help your texture 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:12.049
 natural and only see movement without 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.049
 have it too 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.590
 stylized solense the 3m product that 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:21.140
 personally you use every day 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.510
 24 hours bollywood is amazing I use it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.700
 in photo shoots every day 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.310
 It is the most incredible product because 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.440
 there is the perfect amount of texture and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 bolognesi you can put more layers of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.940
 product you can use the fragile one and that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.890
 over and you still have that volume so 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.260
