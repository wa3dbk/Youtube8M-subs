00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.440
 we have 300 of flour and flour 300 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.440
 corn 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.869
 Four. Five 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 789 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.380
 everything is corn flour common flour 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.880
 Salt oil and water in sufficient quantity 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.670
 cornmeal is blamed for 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.370
 move forward is taking with the hand up 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.140
 and we are going as we are taking 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.809
 we are adding more water that has to be 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.700
 warm if it is good effective of the mass not 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.670
 you have a mass neither very chewing gum nor very 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.460
 lasts a dough that can be dough but 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.500
 that is complete if you do not go to a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 hand that is detached so like this type 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.750
 that is pledge we give the patter 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.540
 nothing else 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:23.040
 I like the mass is the idea that we make 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.390
 well about this size 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.810
 the little balls 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.380
 Y 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380
 this size 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.910
 I put vegetable spray 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.260
 from both sides crushes the more to a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.110
 side of the other and I try to encompass 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.240
 the whole tortilla 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.240
 and I do what I do in the mountains 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.650
 and the thing 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.109
 since they are duties 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.930
 there is a very important secret that that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.790
 just where I have to take the 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.270
 helmet you saw that simple that always 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.800
 simple but if they do not leave much eye is that 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.380
 still did not fish it negotiated and what 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.890
 they leave a lot gets crispy and leaves 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.660
 little remains half soft says he is 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.660
 realizing what wave 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.739
 Y 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.840
 the idea is that this bending already 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.840
 that I do not put the whole route 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.599
 Y 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.030
