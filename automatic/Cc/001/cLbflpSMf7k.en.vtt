freehand vector graphics use geometrical

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.690 
freehand vector graphics use geometrical
shapes<00:00:32.360> like<00:00:32.750> squares<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.350> circles<00:00:33.700> they

click undo and try that I again that's a
little<00:01:25.220> better<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.740> Spile<00:01:28.070> will<00:01:28.280> be<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> little

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
little better the Spile will be a little

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.270 
little better the Spile will be a little
harder<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.660> can<00:01:29.870> use<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> polygon<00:01:30.350> tool<00:01:30.980> to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
harder but I can use the polygon tool to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.890 
harder but I can use the polygon tool to
click<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.670> drag<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:31.970> create<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.690> shape<00:01:32.840> that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.270 

you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.270 
you
I<00:01:48.630> could<00:01:49.630> shape<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.900> smile<00:01:50.320> further<00:01:50.770> by

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
I could shape the smile further by

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.130 
I could shape the smile further by
clicking<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.790> dragging<00:01:51.850> along<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.570> top<00:01:52.810> line

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
clicking and dragging along the top line

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.770 
clicking and dragging along the top line
and<00:01:53.380> creating<00:01:53.920> more<00:01:54.040> points<00:01:57.509> looks<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.630> little

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and creating more points looks a little

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.930 
and creating more points looks a little
simple<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.710> I'll<00:01:59.799> add<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.220> couple<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.580> stars

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
simple so I'll add in a couple of stars

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:11.400 
simple so I'll add in a couple of stars
to<00:02:01.979> start<00:02:02.979> with<00:02:03.159> blue<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.380> maybe<00:02:08.860> purple<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
to start with blue and maybe purple and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.400 
to start with blue and maybe purple and
red<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:19.030> add<00:02:19.150> more<00:02:19.360> detail<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.020> stars

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
red I could add more detail to the stars

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.650 
red I could add more detail to the stars
too<00:02:20.800> if<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.280> were<00:02:21.430> creating<00:02:21.940> artwork<00:02:22.239> for<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
too if I were creating artwork for a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.930 
too if I were creating artwork for a
profile<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> wouldn't<00:02:24.280> show<00:02:24.459> up<00:02:24.489> on<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
profile but it wouldn't show up on the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.290 
profile but it wouldn't show up on the
very<00:02:25.150> tiny<00:02:25.420> rump<00:02:25.750> paintings<00:02:27.090> looks<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.269> a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
very tiny rump paintings looks like a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.250 
very tiny rump paintings looks like a
masterpiece<00:02:28.930> I'll<00:02:29.260> save<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:34.260> go

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
masterpiece I'll save it and then go

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.840 
masterpiece I'll save it and then go
back<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.470> my<00:02:35.769> art<00:02:35.950> kit<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.370> submit<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.819> for

back to my art kit to submit it for

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.509 
back to my art kit to submit it for
moderator<00:02:37.480> approval<00:02:37.980> it'll<00:02:38.980> take<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.220> little

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
moderator approval it'll take a little

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.850 
moderator approval it'll take a little
bit<00:02:39.640> for<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.450> approved<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.440> once<00:02:41.650> it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
bit for it to be approved but once it's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.940 
bit for it to be approved but once it's
done<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.940> use<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.480> my<00:02:43.959> horses<00:02:44.440> my
