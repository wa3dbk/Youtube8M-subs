00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
pena or also the aura oracle right here

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.939 
pena or also the aura oracle right here
next<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.060> will<00:00:24.150> follow<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.630> down<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.580> area

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
also called the eardrum next that will

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.049 
also called the eardrum next that will
separate<00:00:59.280> us<00:00:59.340> from<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> middle<00:01:00.120> ear<00:01:00.480> portion

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
separate us from the middle ear portion

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
separate us from the middle ear portion
here<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.210> can't<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.769> mail<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.220> the
