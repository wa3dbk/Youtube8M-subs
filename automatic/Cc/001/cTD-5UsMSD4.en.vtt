00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.730
 Nine people I'm the voice gets 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
 his new video channel today to one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 more weapons cards though to the pharma 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.219
 Yes, I've got it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.780
 say last days ran battlefield 4 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.189
 actually quite good and had 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 quite fun gave this gameplay 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.410
 but now continue to the weapon 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 the damage is 25 to 18 so the city 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 damage the storm rifles 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.660
 that means we need two to three 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 hits in the head four to six 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.900
 hits in the chest and five to seven 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.000
 hit the legs 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 the job is to start the meter bach 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.949
 means to damage up to eight meters 25 damage 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 From then the damage falls to 18 82 bis 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.180
 55 meters and then we do this too 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 minimal damage the fire rate amounts to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 1000 shot per minute and it with it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 really the highest value of all 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 storm rifles and that's what it will do 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.869
 magazine sometimes very fast 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.519
 empty because the gun shoots so fast 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.680
 and these balls fly with one 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.570
 speed of 6 30 meters as well 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.890
 one of the higher values ​​that is if 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 your goal a little further 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.769
 is removed and her weapon actually 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 have to hold because the balls yes 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.400
 not immediately there then it would have to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 do not go that far because the balls has 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.689
 have a high tempo on it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.000
 there we still have a reach of 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.619
 945 meters is a value to be with 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 the landlord not even approach 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.960
 to reach 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 The capacity is unfortunately a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.249
 negative because this only has 25 plus 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.320
 a shot and that's what she is with 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:24.600
 the high rate of fire incredibly fast 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.789
 empty you really have to be very good 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.799
 his balls take care of them after a long time 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.630
 time is one of the longest are 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 in battlefield 4, two assault rifles 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.060
 and it is in the short reload 2.8 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.560
 in seconds and in the long reload 355 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.039
 seconds to recoil and this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 band is really clean so again 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.149
 incredibly high up 04 after 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 right 0.6 to the left 04 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.060
 that is , incredibly high values 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.639
 hiding mainly to the top right 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 from very strong and has it too 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.429
 very strong fluctuations to the left 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.100
 over 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.829
 we have multiplier at the first 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.990
 shot of 25 that means in the first shot 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.880
 have again the 25-fold recoil and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.290
 then the weapon goes off right 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.180
 to control and since this is about 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.020
 a burka weapon means that is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.940
 magazines 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.220
 seen further back is the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 Scattering the visor if you stand something 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.510
 higher than other hours will be where 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620
 that does not have the case, this is 025 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.390
 So a little higher 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.210
 for it is when the visor, the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.410
 thereby moving slightly lower the 208 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.380
 means we can also move 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.210
 but you should shoot but overall 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.100
 rather avoid it because you stop in the stand 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.560
 but still a piece is more accurate 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.210
 the bold ob design is the driver of something 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 more accurate than weapons that are not 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.660
 design are built 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.710
 she is about a quarter more precise 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.270
 in most 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.830
 And that makes itself in the melee 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.420
 already clearly noticeable because you look 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.160
 should be able to shoot something more accurate 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.990
 now we come to the essays and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.330
 to a topic where I am not 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.800
 I'm sure I had to be so 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.530
 Search a little bit at times 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.180
 the ranking list what you are the players 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.720
 Use a lot with the fans 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.520
 to have 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.790
 and they finally came along too 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.620
 my chosen setup already over 1 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.450
 that would be for example the visor again 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 a loan there is really that 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.610
 melee is small with little edge off 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.200
 point perfect for aiming a laser 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.970
 You can choose which ones you want 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 We the three emitters takes the green 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.270
 or the normal I have the though 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.580
 normal taken completely enough 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.840
 after that I have the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.090
 commentator taken as in 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 Educational brake the condenser lower 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.170
 residue left and right and the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 muzzle brake the up and then 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.530
 I have to compare where is it more 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.150
 it's just left and right 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.690
 but altogether of value 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
 much higher up there by 0.1 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.190
 it is always lowered to the side 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.380
 it is lowered to the left by 0.1 and after 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.840
 right number 0 15 so the value there 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.240
 is a bit higher now 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.620
 talked teds vegas and then it is 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.520
 actually very important because 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.130
 Ultimately, it's about how you are 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.930
 playful fabric gets along or yourself 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.910
 Finally came with the capacitor 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.170
 handle better and last than handle 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.780
 I have to go back then 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.209
 wrapped handle grasped what a 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.310
 example human that is of course one 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.810
 handle the recoil lowers and 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 actually therefore you're there 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.250
 has the driver of the high rebound 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.040
 the ergonomic grip and also the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.950
 reason grip two ways the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.229
 Precision to hear something but are from 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.760
 Unfortunately, the effect is rather weak 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.480
 unfortunately only minimal I would too 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.390
 say the trouble 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 funny is the still clear but the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.750
 Wrapped up if you want the burst very much 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.120
 the lack of it keeps up small 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.190
 precision boost is not that noticeable 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.900
 ultimately driving would even say it 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.760
 is a weapon with very high recoil 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.890
 and unfortunately also little succession that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.480
 you also have mini burston though 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.220
 Overall , she is not so bad 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.990
 since they really are the highest 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.760
 or rather with the lowest 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.740
 köhler shared she can easily 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.110
 incredibly fast a player 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.430
 shoot it down is just easy 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.740
 the problem as soon as we go easy 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.440
 continues or is more 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.940
 unfortunately, do not perform this weapon 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.040
 more so good and maybe there is 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.260
 even better alternatives in the arcade 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.400
 lampards shot has more and sometimes 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.350
 a little easier to control 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.330
 is or are accessed equal to or ac 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.580
 1180 because it was me anyway that the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.380
 currently very easy to control 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.000
 are 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.620
 Once again pharma is such a thing 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.210
 single opponent for one person in the 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.920
 melee is the then the then then 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.600
 Absolutely awesome that 's it with these 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.580
 arms money i have top right again 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.460
 the weapons apply playlist linked and 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.380
 bottom right my last video and that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.030
 with five tips for the sniper 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.740
 if you want to support me 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.880
 still under high I own this 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.880
 video how three people
