know the status of the headset this is
the<00:00:27.630> microphone<00:00:28.199> basically<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the microphone basically you get a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600 
the microphone basically you get a
variety<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.650> earbuds<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.859> use<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.309> also<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.579> a

exactly<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.510> favorite<00:00:42.540> implementation<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
exactly my favorite implementation of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.020 
exactly my favorite implementation of
volume<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> press<00:00:44.850> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
volume because you have to press this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930 
volume because you have to press this
one<00:00:45.390> button<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.800> through<00:00:47.039> three<00:00:47.250> power

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
one button to go through three power

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540 
one button to go through three power
setting<00:00:48.300> volume<00:00:48.989> settings<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.160> favorite

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
setting volume settings not my favorite

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
setting volume settings not my favorite
implementation<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> get

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
implementation but that's what you get

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
implementation but that's what you get
for<00:00:53.250> style<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.670> guess<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
for style I guess and you have this

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260 
for style I guess and you have this
multifunction<00:00:56.160> button<00:00:56.399> over<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.610> which

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
multifunction button over here which

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990 
multifunction button over here which
kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.920> similar<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
kind of looks very similar to the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.689 
kind of looks very similar to the
iPhones<00:01:01.070> menu<00:01:02.070> button

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
iPhones menu button

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.240 
iPhones menu button
as<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> might<00:01:03.329> notice<00:01:03.619> that's<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.860> some

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
as you might notice that's what some

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
as you might notice that's what some
iPhone<00:01:05.519> owners<00:01:05.970> might<00:01:06.150> actually<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
iPhone owners might actually like this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
iPhone owners might actually like this
because<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> comes<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.799> black<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> white<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
because it comes in black and white and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
because it comes in black and white and
it<00:01:08.610> suits<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> iPhone<00:01:09.720> variable<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.979> yeah<00:01:12.920> at

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it suits the iPhone variable so yeah at

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.450 
it suits the iPhone variable so yeah at
the<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> power<00:01:15.119> charging

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
the back you have the power charging

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.380 
the back you have the power charging
micro<00:01:17.460> USB<00:01:19.070> adapter<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
micro USB adapter and that's about it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.620 
micro USB adapter and that's about it
yeah<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
yeah so what do we think of this now I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
yeah so what do we think of this now I
posted<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> review<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.880> website<00:01:26.909> already

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
