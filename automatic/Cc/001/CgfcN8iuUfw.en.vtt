00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.680
 welcome 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.480
 history of the tribe of the cording today 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 let's take step 3 finally 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 export so let's talk about 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.800
 export of movies and frank degree o 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.340
 export of individual frames 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.439
 see here the 2.0 study is in a group 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.830
 I have already imported and converted a clip 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.010
 I imported it into my timeline e 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.989
 I will use this single clip as 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.550
 simulator of a possible assembly that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.129
 could that you might have 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 realized for which we did everything 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.850
 what we had to do imagine 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.040
 having done the editing have reached i 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.470
 the music comes to the headlines 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.519
 export the movie we can do it in 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.949
 two ways the first and click on step 3 e 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.710
 will open the export window or 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.939
 otherwise we can click share e 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.189
 do export dot.com the share ci function 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.760
 will serve later when we talk about 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:12.590
 export style ie single frames 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 images now by clicking on export appears 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.450
 the screen that allows us 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.460
 basically to see the management 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.560
 of resources then say where we would like 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.990
 exported our movie but the one up 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 to which we must concentrate item 37 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.359
 we have this series of presets and there 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.159
 we will concentrate substantially on 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.499
 differences between them in this first 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.689
 part of the video before talking about the 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:37.340
 export presets I would like to talk a 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.850
 moment of speech more generally 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.530
 intended to hold resolutions I cover 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.319
 at the present moment I am able to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.909
 record in numerous resolutions 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.189
 the gopro hero iii stop then hero iii is 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.590
 able to record up to 30 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.609
 frames per second up to 2.7 hood 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.950
 resolution for which 7 twenty thousand 82.7 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.600
 15 frames per second for the 4K instead 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 the hero 3 class 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.670
 it reaches 30 frames per second 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.289
 at 4k you see the various resolutions 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.280
 explained 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.349
 these are the resolutions of 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 registration when the time comes 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.720
 to export to share your own 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.430
 video normally reasons in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.060
 lower resolutions 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.890
 except for special exceptions the objective 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.769
 especially when it comes to exporting 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.340
 on youtube or on vimeo is that of 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.500
 go down to at least 1080p keep in mind 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.090
 this 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.030
 also remember that it is a good rule 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 never go up resolution if you have 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.480
 worked at 720p 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 you should never export to for 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.790
 example 1080p the voices we can 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.780
 choose from the various presets are youtube 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.599
 mobile vimeo 720p and 1080p and one last 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.510
 item that archive we won't look at 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.610
 now why our intention 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.760
 export do not archive the format 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.890
 archive export a fu files inform that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.260
 is a gopro studio owner and file 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.660
 in proprietary format and serves precisely 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 to manage archive projects not 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.340
 to share them we see now 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.840
 what are the differences between the various 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.180
 resolve the first difference 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.910
 obviously that catches the eye are the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.079
 different megabits per second 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.850
 then for youtube and 8 vimeo and 15 mo 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.639
 weil two ways thus talking about what it is 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.470
 this unit of measurement is what it is 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.670
 substance what the estimate stands for 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.709
 itself that is how many megabits constitute 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.010
 a second so you take these 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.100
 put 25 frames together 25 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.790
 frames will occupy 8 of average 8 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
 megabit 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.040
 because 25 frames in europe are a 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.239
 second and therefore is an estimate of the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.590
 compression 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.380
 let's say that even a system for 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.750
 calculate more or less how big it will be 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.090
 your movie in terms of space 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.940
 on the hard disk and possibly 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.370
 then once the first three are loaded 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.250
 resolutions the first neglected presets 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.829
 what they have characteristic of work 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.890
 based on the resolution of the project 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.100
 there is the resolution 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.500
 which you worked if you in step 1 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.330
 you converted the clips to resolution 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.880
 1080 and then choose to export to 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.670
 example through three sets youtube the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.340
 Your video will be an 8 megabit video 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.260
 according to media has a resolution of 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.660
 1080 because you have always worked 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.280
 worked on that resolution is like this 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.900
 net shopping 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.360
 if instead you choose the last two items 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.870
 therefore 720p and 1080p are defining not 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.070
 only the bitrate but also the resolution 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.130
 of the image you filmed at 2.7k 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.810
 choose to export at 720p state 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.870
 changing the pit lane 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.240
 then the 8 megapixels with and 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.220
 resolution 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.900
 so these are the two main ones 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.740
 what differences would I choose 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.500
 normally it happens to me 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.600
 export movies at 720p except 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.370
 particular requests because how 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.750
 resolution on youtube is the best 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.250
 compromise between connections maybe not 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.470
 always performing and excellence in 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.710
 in the image so 720p at 8 megabits 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.720
 second is a great second compromise 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.060
 me to export share a movie 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.050
 but just know that you have 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.560
 these various possible alternatives 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.810
 as regards instead 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.830
 therefore the export of frames is 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.500
 welcome share export steel we have 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.650
 four possible small resolutions 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.990
 medium large and current resolutions 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.210
 see listed you will recognize 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.890
 probably medium and large because they are 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.410
 the resolution of 720p and 1080p 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:11.260
 respectively while act wall is the 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.820
 original size you have 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.919
 worked for which you worked with 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.380
 4k resolution and you did too 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.890
 any montange you want to export a 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.770
 single frame 4k lari just three sets 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.110
 to choose 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.210
 in this specific case it is obviously a 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.069
 having said that I would say that 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.039
 basically we concluded that 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.720
 that was the speech about the voice 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.300
 exports 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.370
 I hope the video was clear if there 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.590
 were doubts feel free to 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.409
 write in the comments if there were 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.270
 liked the tutorial let us a like 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.849
 I like it on youtube which it always does 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.190
 well and if you want to see when they come out 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.440
 our next tutorials sign up 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.720
 the channel has nothing to do but greet you 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.440
 wish you good shooting in the case 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.060
 he could make them and then goodbye 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.060
 at the next tutorial hello
