00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:26.000
My name is Evgenniy Sinelnikov, and along with the team from Andoran: Prologue, we are glad to welcome you to the second episode of our special podcast, in which we will continue to introduce the voiceover crew

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Suthay-raht is a breed of cunning and agile Khajiit,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Andrey: [purrs] Moon sugar...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.000
And are voiced by Andrey ‘Rhymer’ Sherman

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Andrey: If you have a tail and whiskers, everyone considers you an unscrupulous brigand. Blame is always heaped on Khajiit shoulders. Is that really fair?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Andrey: 	Oh, too bad, too bad...it appears that either rats or some filthy zombie will gnaw your head off!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Andrey: May you always walk on warm sands

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Female Khajiit are voiced by Ellen ‘Ajira’ Kulakova

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Ellen: Some sugar for you, friend?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:36.000
Ellen: Dakhlanna trades rice. Dakhlanna sells it cheaper than Old Verus. So Dakhlanna’s business runs well

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.000
Ellen: May your path always be easy

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.000
As well as Khajiit, Ellen also performs other roles, for example the females of the militant Orc race:

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.500
Ellen: Mum got killed. Watch out, I'm on the warpath and you don’t want to get in my way

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Ellen: I don't give a damn about those elves!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the dark-skinned Redguards, the mighty warriors and brave seafarers:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Vyacheslav: The more you know the easier it is to cope with difficult situations.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
…are acted by Vyacheslav “Mystic” Pasmannik

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Vyacheslav: 	Hey, citizen, would you take a copy of ‘Empire's Voice’? Only eighty coins!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Vyacheslav: Treat your equipment well and it will treat you well

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
Vyacheslav: You will find only the best goods in here

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And all too soon we find ourselves at the end of today’s podcast, so we’d like to tell you a bit about how Adroran: Prologue’s voiceover is conceived

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We don’t simply assign voiceovers to races, as in all the other Elder Scrolls games. Each character has his or her own distinct nature and temperament, and is voiced individually

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Some races have several age categories, and each one is assigned to a different person

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Moreover, as well as race-specific voice actors, there are also voice actors who voice only one NPC…and we’ll surely introduce some of them to you in the following podcasts

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Anyway, that’s all for now—thanks for listening and goodbye!
