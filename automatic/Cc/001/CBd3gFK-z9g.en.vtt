an<00:05:36.430> entry-level<00:05:36.990> Symbian<00:05:37.990> 3<00:05:38.169> phone<00:05:38.469> without

an entry-level Symbian 3 phone without

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.390 
an entry-level Symbian 3 phone without
the<00:05:39.070> GPU<00:05:39.669> would<00:05:40.120> be<00:05:40.979> something<00:05:41.979> like<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:44.400> 5230

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
the GPU would be something like the 5230

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.379 
the GPU would be something like the 5230
was<00:05:45.820> in<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.180> feeling<00:05:46.599> in<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.259> best<00:05:47.469> last<00:05:47.919> year

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.200 
but I guess I got a premium handset here
and<00:05:53.560> then<00:05:53.710> two<00:05:53.919> level<00:05:54.250> premium<00:05:54.639> hands<00:05:55.469> ok
