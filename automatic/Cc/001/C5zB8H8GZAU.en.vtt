00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 so hello now flying in mocha it was 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.930
 the beginning of the crash course from the author 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.300
 shall happen I have a bit there 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
 that's why I only have that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 I do not have to take my car 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
 Wear all leather protective clothing and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 It also brings us straight to the introduction 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 from the whole course here addressed to whom 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.140
 the course 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 it would of course be beneficial if you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 already have the car license if 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 have them then you have what namely 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 a clutch is and how to switch 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's just about where is that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.430
 Coupling where the circuit and how 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 then it looks exactly 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.780
 from the optics but otherwise know 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 you like it works but it works 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.859
 even if you have the A1 driver's license 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 do and you are 16 and obvious 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.680
 I do not have a car driver's license 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.930
 It is not bad then 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 the next video the playlist will be you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.229
 so very rudimentary and short 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.430
 teach what ever that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.070
 Clutch is why it is a clutch 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.740
 should be or should the car when 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.570
 petrol engines and diesel engines and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 then that would be dealt with from all over 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 nice way in here around the window 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 listened 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.729
 Climate protection clothing is already a good one 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 point then what do I need for protection 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.030
 smaller and so I ever motorcycle 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.689
 driving laws may be prescribed 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.610
 only the helmet 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.930
 I would highly recommend you 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.360
 Show me my middle finger now times 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.330
 Hope you can see it there 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.940
 the limb is a scar and indeed 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.060
 I had a ride had 120 km h 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560
 not fast on the expressway and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.939
 he is in the stone raising against the hand me 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.080
 I did not notice it and almost 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.490
 that's just really down 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.049
 bled like this I do not have 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 thought that the stinking finger bleed so 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.479
 I would advise you to wear each one 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.759
 case a helmet and gloves carry one 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.679
 solid jacket best hold leather jacket 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 or something and of course a long pants 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.310
 and firm footwear as not with high 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.049
 heels flip flops or as far as or with 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.679
 short pants or something like that at the beginning 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.539
 driving school 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.250
 It is important and it does not cost 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.319
 like money and you have to look like that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.940
 you give 800 900 euro of motorcycle 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.280
 driver's license then they can too 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 times with security of used 50 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.790
 or lay down 100 euros 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 for used gloves 10 euro it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 really does not cost much 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 it is your safety and it does not have to be 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.970
 high end helmet are better than even 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.530
 nothing and you need everything for the second 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.019
 what I explain here refers to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.190
 relatively modern motorcycles in cars 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.570
 the differences are not quite so 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.570
 serious as with motorcycles end 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.240
 cobbler in basket 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.590
 not noticed because she is on the phone 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.630
 the bike supernova hybrid 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.340
 stayed with cars for example 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.140
 the clutch is always left in the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.550
 middle is the brake and right the gas 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.280
 the circuit is located between 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.780
 driver and passenger side and also of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 the controls where the blinker sets 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 and so on, everything is quite similar 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 with motorcycles for example the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.040
 circuit that can go down the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.600
 can be directed upwards 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.250
 the neutral gear can be between the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.980
 first and second page at most 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.340
 It can also be below the first gear 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.330
 his 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.760
 So there are different ones 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 possibilities the most common is what 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.660
 My machine has that too 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.069
 reasonably solid basis for tutorial 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.130
 That's why I did it 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.750
 but otherwise you just have to stop 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.850
 the machine so on what your 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.890
 best buddy the machine unfortunately too 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.440
 say or we have your driving instructor 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.410
 the motorcycle introduces I already have 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.330
 a few things anticipated namely 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.739
 switch everything, and so on 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.480
 separate video but before we 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.730
 I want to continue a thing 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.230
 emphasize and that is so important to me 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.150
 I claim planners for that 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.280
 machine clicks that I already have you 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.680
 would like to mention if all 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.030
 if you panic if you do not 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.600
 oh god I realize I have no control 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.040
 more 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.320
 You notice that burn here now 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.660
 through the new brain you pull the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.200
 Clutch and brakes very gently 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.990
 so left hand of you looked as 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.850
 the left hand clutch completely through 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.990
 and with the right light on the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.730
 brake it will always be normal 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.890
 if he does not have a checkout 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.660
 curve vaart or something then you come 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.830
 with it to a standstill and it can you 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.040
 nothing happens so plum goal quite easily 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.110
 Brake this safety instruction carries 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.930
 then release your protective clothing 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.550
 get your first drive video now 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.190
 two explains just as said the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.690
 a1 what a clutch is like that 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.910
 otherwise you can do the same 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.010
 with video number three carry on the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.150
 controls of a motorcycle I am 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.200
 the flying motto i wish you 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.200
 have fun with the playlist
