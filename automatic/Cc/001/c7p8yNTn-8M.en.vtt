00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.310
 delve into those native foods 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.619
 Peruvians who are known as the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.100
 inka food and have come here 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.470

 we have here the xanthi truth that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.960
 property without being in sank and that takes away 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.850
 hungry apart is considered to be a 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.650
 natural moisturizer for example has 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.270
 five times more potassium than banana 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.340
 in natural Peru with the university and 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.960
 we have done a study that practically 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.850
 It also has a cleaning effect of 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.519
 colon you know is very important 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.019
 be able to evacuate easily and then this 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.000
 has a form that also helps us 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.040
 fight gastritis then it's a 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.629
 very important source there are more than 100 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.360
 natural tons in huancavelica 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.830
 ayacucho and arequipa and currently good 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.810
 several products are already being made 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.700
 like the extract and the sangin shampoo 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.490
 good but the streak is one of the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.170
 most important foods of South America 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.270
 has nine times more calcium than the potato 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.219
 has twice as much iron 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 has one thousand milligrams of magnesium per 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.020
 every 100 grams of racacha 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.969
 for example osteoporosis also anemia 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.149
 for people with depression and even 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.490
 for the amount of magnesium then so 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.929
 is is a fruit or is a root that for 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.020
 example in Brazil, the 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.090
 arracacha and use it for the elderly or 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.520
 young children who have problems for 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.170
 digest other foods they throw 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.209
 very fine starch we also have the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.860
 Black Quinoa here but what has 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.209
 you explain to me is like the one that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.250
 eat because this looks like a kind of 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.890
 Yucca looks just like we already have 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.989
 parboiled and how all that went to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420
 they won if it was a papa Maria or 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:55.429
 a yellow yucca all you can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.069
 cooking with potatoes we can do it with 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.450
 racacha you have to remember maric the one that the 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.310
 Racacha name is the Quechua name 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.829
 Peruvian not because there are other names 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.950
 also in South America where also 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.250
 is used because I ask it maybe 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.200
 to clear them 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 should be clear look to do the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 lemonade the sun that we need 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.360
 only half fruit of sank and here 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.360
 let's prepare this and we need 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.570

 that for example in the area of ayacucho 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.550
 they mix it with medicinal plants to 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.770
 the cold then serves us for example 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.440
 to fight asthma helps us 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.880

 as if it were a rubber that refreshing 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.630
 because there is just inflammation in the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.650
 case of gastritis and that is going to 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.440
