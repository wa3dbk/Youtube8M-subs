00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.430

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.070
 custom of short forest 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:35.690
 as also a net person of the place 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.109
 with its custom also for cheeses 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.500
 are the challenges that will always cover in 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:45.280
 layers has been identified with this 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 our important products 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200
 to nobody 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 intimately 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 I believe that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.310
 His name of the Lord is also Julian 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 We have here to do to use 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.170
 costadito marcha and palma was great 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.830
 the blame 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 from me this will be in the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.869
 hills 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.960
 and I think that way they are 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.960
 using 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.630

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 What are you doing 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.740
 the swollen ones 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.549
 to the molds that sense now let's 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.940
 select already cut to select 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.690
 be able to take the mountain to use it in 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690
