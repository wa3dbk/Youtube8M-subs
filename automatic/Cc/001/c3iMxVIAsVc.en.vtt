00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
of money and I was fairly observant and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.830 
of money and I was fairly observant and
picked<00:01:39.520> up<00:01:39.670> some<00:01:39.880> things<00:01:39.910> read<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.570> lot<00:01:40.690> of

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
picked up some things read a lot of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.740 
picked up some things read a lot of
magazines<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.500> shooting<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.360> still<00:01:43.570> it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
magazines on shooting and it still it

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.480 
magazines on shooting and it still it
took<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.960> long<00:01:44.200> time<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.710> get<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.920> where<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.190> was

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
took a long time to get to where I was

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.980 
took a long time to get to where I was
and<00:01:45.819> I<00:01:45.910> think<00:01:45.970> if<00:01:46.240> I'd<00:01:46.360> have<00:01:46.479> taken<00:01:46.780> lessons

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
and I think if I'd have taken lessons

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.109 
and I think if I'd have taken lessons
and<00:01:47.440> had<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> gun<00:01:47.830> fitted<00:01:48.160> early<00:01:48.550> on<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:49.000> would

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
and had a gun fitted early on it would

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.570 
and had a gun fitted early on it would
have<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:50.560> have<00:01:50.649> worked<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.890> little<00:01:51.100> faster

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
have would have worked a little faster

family just they they made me go and it
was<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:35.739> say<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.920> least<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.520> quite

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
was to say the least it was quite

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.190 
was to say the least it was quite
emotional<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> didn't<00:02:37.690> shoot<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:38.020> that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
emotional and I didn't shoot all that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.309 
emotional and I didn't shoot all that
well<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.340> shot<00:02:40.180> well<00:02:40.390> enough<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.810> win<00:02:40.989> and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.320 
well but I shot well enough to win and
so<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.099> think<00:02:42.310> somebody<00:02:42.520> was<00:02:42.880> looking

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330 
so I have to think somebody was looking
out<00:02:43.480> for<00:02:43.690> me<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.739> trophy<00:02:45.160> meant

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
out for me but I that one trophy meant

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.949

more<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.550> me<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> take<00:02:46.150> back<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.599> give<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.840> my

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
more to me to take back and give to my

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.610 
more to me to take back and give to my

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
on station number five what I would look

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.400 
on station number five what I would look
for<00:03:00.849> on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> first<00:03:01.450> target<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.050> was<00:03:02.170> thrown

and just from shooting a lot most of the
targets<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.430> will<00:03:12.640> try<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:12.940> shoot<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.330> before

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450

your breakpoint is what you want to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.940 
your breakpoint is what you want to
figure<00:03:28.640> out<00:03:28.820> first<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:29.990> where<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.680> want

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
figure out first and then where you want

to put your gun you know where you want

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.080 
to put your gun you know where you want
to<00:03:33.290> hold<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:34.400> then<00:03:34.580> where<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.850> want<00:03:35.030> to

to hold it and then where you want to

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.000 
to hold it and then where you want to
pick<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.450> target<00:03:35.870> up<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.590> those<00:03:36.740> are<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
pick the target up so those are the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.070 
pick the target up so those are the
three<00:03:37.220> most<00:03:37.370> important<00:03:37.970> things<00:03:38.030> what<00:03:38.840> what

target they can throw a bat to target
which<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.360> about<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.750> third<00:03:48.020> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.320> thickness

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680
