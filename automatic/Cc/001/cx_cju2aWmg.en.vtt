 him on a wooden board thanks bob what 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.220
 will do the fat that stayed us 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.880
 short merge it in the sink then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.880
 put sorrowfully strong fire and bad and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.000
 and cleaned you saw how much 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 left at the bottom you need to remove it in no 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.819
 in which case is it 40 so this liquid 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.400
 which the meat produces when it 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.239
 fry from this make gravy for 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.170
 roast 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.269
 I probably know clear 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.540
 this is called dissolve in 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:55.860
 caramelized juice 100 milliliters 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 more than enough water 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.180
 three minutes and then pour juice into a bowl 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.180
 through a fine sieve 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.220
 now heat the oven to 270 degrees 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:17.520
 stand thermostat on 9 mice seems 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.520
 the meat is already cold then you can cut it 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.500
 we cut 11 identical pieces and set 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.820
 them one after another very well guys 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.820
 You know, if you just put all these 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.450
 pieces next will usually hot but 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.530
 we want to cook a hot surprise I 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:54.489
 I know I need to put a surprise between 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:58.000
 just thats and a surprise to be 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.390
 even more we say runner and this is work 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.300
 for fergana beam 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.340
 red idea right cooks us now 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.970
 need foil to wrap 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.519
 roast 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.160
 we need two big sheets that we 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.970
 put each other on them we put 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.970
 roast 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.940
 you can fly and Darko batter two 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.400
 sheet of foil please bob put them 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.060
 top claire will help you gently 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.060
 tuck the edges 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 think pretty i 'm pretty open 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.800
 seems like a huge candy 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.210
 god you could not be on whether the 300 milliliters 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:02.030
 water in this form we put it hot 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:06.470
 and so that water straight into the water would have missions 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.900
 this is zine floating island don't worry 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:15.979
 the water in the oven will evaporate quickly and the steam 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:18.610
 speeding up cooking roast will 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.610
 get ready 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:30.770
 Do not forget about the mitten when you put 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:33.759
 roast in the oven and by whom would we 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.759
 to do 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.789
 so still in mittens we take out 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.949
 the form is very careful not to wait 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:04.610
 see if everything is there as you say 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:07.550
 Michelle cut'll go on top of and lay 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.039
 roast veal on a plate and then you need to 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:15.379
 a lot of sleep follows this for sauce not 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.619
 at first we will add liquid cream 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:25.759
 and juice and pour it all into the pan and 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:28.339
 heat up and sow starts to boil 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.919
 very good this is my secret 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:36.430
 gravy turns out to be thicker if we 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:41.029
 bring it to a boil smells delicious 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.370
 rains bob almost everything is left 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.509
 boil for 4 minutes to make the sauce 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.830
 half as much 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.830
 in the meantime, we'll cut an onion there 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.240
 I think the sauce 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.530
 from a great thought yes well now something 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.229
 can eat 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:10.530

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.000

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.159
