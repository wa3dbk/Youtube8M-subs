00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.109
 is so friends now let's fine tune 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 unesco model 97 the first thing we have 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.009
 what to do as the car comes hot 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 to wash injectors now since the 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.299
 liquid was the liquid injectors 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.580
 contains acids is not combustible 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 the car must be hot and I 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 I always recommend because being 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 hot and with old cheeks 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 because then pieces of coal come out like that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.700
 that we're going to wash injectors with the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.350
 injectors put because because it's more 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.110
 cheap because the other one to remove 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.180
 injectors change tips and other challenges 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.150
 remember in fort we always go to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 get our line switch in 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.500
 this spot car is in the part 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.730
 back if you realize here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.150
 he says was the function 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.830
 switch 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.960
 It is fuel pump switch 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.790
 Here is what we are going to do 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.830
 go down a little bit that has remove the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.920
 things so they can see how the switch is 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.810
 If you can not see, it's the same as 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.900
 kart that is what we should do to him 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 give it a little blow so that it 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 disconnect you are going to see how the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.900
 red piece and there already added 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 disconnect our fuel pump 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 when we finish washing injectors 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 we're just going 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.450
 to go down truth but again it's not a 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 hit this one for what it's worth when 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.180
 the car shock we flipped any 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.180
 thing this one is going to disconnect like this 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.860
 to prevent the carriage can 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 set on fire at the time of taking us away 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.070
 true fuel pressure friends 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 then remember everything so they have 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.319
 the dry and in different parts 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.539
 our pump disconnected 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.000
 fuel now let's proceed to the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.000
 front to wash our injectors
