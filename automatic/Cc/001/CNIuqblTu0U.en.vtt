stuff like that you've got lots of room
to<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.579> anything<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.939> this

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to do anything you want so and this

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.819 
to do anything you want so and this
thing<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.270> flipping<00:01:45.840> over<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
thing is not flipping over it's just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.760 
thing is not flipping over it's just
like<00:01:47.159> having<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.640> hockey<00:01:48.119> puck<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.509> ice<00:01:48.770> it's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
like having a hockey puck on ice it's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030 
like having a hockey puck on ice it's
the<00:01:50.399> closest<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.000> I'd<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.829> it's<00:01:52.829> very

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the closest thing I'd say and it's very

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
the closest thing I'd say and it's very
similar<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> having<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.180> hockey<00:01:54.509> shooting

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
similar to having this hockey shooting

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.370 
similar to having this hockey shooting
pad<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.299> nicer<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> lot

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pad but it's a lot nicer it's a lot

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
pad but it's a lot nicer it's a lot
bigger<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.340> nice<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.790> can

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
bigger so it's really nice like you can

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.429 
bigger so it's really nice like you can
practice<00:02:00.360> putting<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> puck<00:02:01.229> through<00:02:01.380> your

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
practice putting the puck through your

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
practice putting the puck through your
leg<00:02:01.710> stuff<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
leg stuff like that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
leg stuff like that
and<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.080> sort<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.440> walk<00:02:04.650> around

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and you can actually sort of walk around

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
and you can actually sort of walk around
on<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.430> pack<00:02:05.580> his<00:02:05.790> stuff<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
on it and pack his stuff it's like you

thick but it's a really durable sort of
bendy<00:03:23.640> plastic<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.630> doesn't<00:03:24.870> shatter

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
bendy plastic so it doesn't shatter

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.080 
bendy plastic so it doesn't shatter
anything<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.739> when<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:25.980> hit<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.220> I'm

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
yet to test it in the winter time but

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.680 
yet to test it in the winter time but
we'll<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:29.970> stay<00:03:30.150> tuned<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.600> we'll

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
we'll do that so stay tuned and we'll

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.180 
we'll do that so stay tuned and we'll
see<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:31.200> it'll<00:03:31.380> break<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.829> winter<00:03:32.040> time

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
see if it'll break in the winter time

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
see if it'll break in the winter time
but<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.030> far<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.540> here<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.900> summer<00:03:34.110> I've

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
but so far and here in the summer I've

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.110 
but so far and here in the summer I've
been<00:03:34.380> taking<00:03:34.620> lots<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.860> shots<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.640> a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
bunch of slap shots before I shot the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.340 
bunch of slap shots before I shot the
video<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.519> works<00:03:39.329> perfectly<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:40.200> nice
