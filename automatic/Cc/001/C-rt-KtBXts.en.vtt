 female is also they have the same function 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 only it is used for baby serial port 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:46.030
 and 25 and another used serial port bbb9 is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.820
 loop around pin 2 and think three 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.329
 teachers look using a solder but 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.489

 this is the intention of the board where the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 people have connections of 25 here behind 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 computer 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 we can observe and here we have 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.450
 a 232 gps card and here we have 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.159
 more upon it another board dij rs 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.010
 422 is the extension is connected on the board 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.790
 of low 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.400

 very good tool that we use a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.160
 field and this serial port is essential 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.460
 that our job is I'm going to put another 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.460
 bequeathed 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.670
 the vec is already connected to a port 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.789
 serial bertÃ³ we are going to use the program 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.789

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.859
 this means that the door is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.989
 running and that the loopback is 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:59.730
