really like about it though is this is
the<00:01:48.640> best<00:01:48.790> expression<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.540> Android<00:01:49.869> wear<00:01:50.110> it

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
the best expression of Android wear it

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.190 
the best expression of Android wear it
does<00:01:51.070> where<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.549> does<00:01:51.790> run<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.600> exact<00:01:52.960> same

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200
