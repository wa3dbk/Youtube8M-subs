00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.380
 I started at the institute summits after 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.820
 I went to a government kindergarten and now 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.860
 I'm in two government schools in two 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.930
 secondary since next I started in 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.060
 the summits this twelve years ago 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.800
 and I really enjoy being with children I 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.810
 I really like teaching, so that's what 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.790
 made me decide to take the race and 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.380
 do it well and I was already doing it or 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.689
 be you are going to teach them but it ends 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.840
 being this the one you learn from them 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.400
 because the boys are lost not 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.830
 they know where they go they want me not to 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.900
 they want families are the same in 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.879
 actually the boys suffer a lot this 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 that the parents separated that the dads 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.960
 they do not want them that dads are not in 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.390
 home then if I practice like 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 teacher is fundamental I think that to me 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.220
 daily there is a story that they tell me 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.989
 girls raped this 12 year old boy 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.520
 taking care of siblings of three four and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.100
 five is all afternoon getting 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.960
 completely responsible in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.059
 drug addiction good I think that in the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.219
 late 80% of the boys have 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.739
 those problems yes yes yes they are 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.600
 very strong problems I tell you that 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.160
 daily there is something daily apart from that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.920
 you have to teach a class and you have to 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.600
 teaching something is very heavy but also 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.600
 it's very motivating look 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.689
 I do not run, I just wanted to 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.340
 back to school because the 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.920
 big boys were in the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.950
 university they were already there by the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.850
 world and pedrito and nothing else I had left 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.899
 the boy who was in the lux but he 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.719
 He was very devoted to his courses and 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.200
 sports and I've given you all the saint 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.509
 come then then I get bored of 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.799
 be alone that I find them in the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.709
 master street and I myself was his student 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.560
 they do not remember then, not who you are 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.959
 popularity although already when they smile and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.229
 I remember all of that with 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:03.009
 a lot of love they find me and I 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.310
 they greet as that child is not the Lord 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.160
 the one who greets me is the child who 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.829
 He was with me with that confidence and with 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.450
 that love because one of my 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.780
 children and a mini-grandson that was almost like 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.720
 he told me then 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.640
 I fell like a stone in the face and it turns out 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.650
 I got sick and I was almost ready 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.740
 to die and all that and right now I'm 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.280
 taking care of my health to be able to come and give 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.280
 lessons
