all eight disciplines it is to be noted
that<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.290> cost<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.709> changing<00:03:33.859> disciplines

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
that the cost of changing disciplines

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
discipline so if you are changing back

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.539

to a former to skill discipline it'll be
more<00:03:40.790> expensive<00:03:41.060> than<00:03:41.359> changing<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.840> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
more expensive than changing to a
