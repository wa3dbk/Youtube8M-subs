 adopting 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.100
 4 the of the ones cave is now with the will 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.100
 of prison 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:34.879
 Careful as the gods are crazy 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.920
 and bounce all we pringamos but for 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.059
 luck we will remedy this very 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.890
 important to the gods nicandro the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.199
 history of Greek mythology has been 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.570
 tackled in a multitude of games to pose or 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.250
 it is different very different what 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.559
 we may have seen in the games as 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.140
 ghost of war to quote the most 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.360
 representative of this era 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.250
 this free downloadable title for 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.489
 the users of playstation plus is 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.650
 available in ps 4 and I started with zeus a 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.479
 the head the gods have abandoned their 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 people and therefore the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.030
 problems like mushrooms good more than mushrooms 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.430
 there are deaths everywhere and these are 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.360
 they accumulate the val expands throughout the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.520
 territory 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.490
 Nicandro is the last champion of the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.140
 humanity that is, we must pass 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.270
 the land of the dead will arrive 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.610
 until Mount Olympus infiltrate and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 put an end to the gods is chupao 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.450
 true put this company will be all 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 less easy 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 gods that show off those tricks and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 powers to kill us though 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.179
 to get to them we have to go 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.640
 eliminating a lot of soldiers by 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.259
 the way someone after the study 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.539
 responsible for this game has acquired 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.250
 offer a known story but with 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.920
 an entirely different approach to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.799
 usual and this is part of the charm of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.780
 This product is highly recommended on 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.579
 artistic and technical aspect are based on 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.770
 animate the typical drawings that we have 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.840
 seen from that era flat in 2d with 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.970
 sudden movements as if they were 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.789
 of cardboard characters to whom they 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 missing transitions this symbology and 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.959
 these traces that move us to the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.510
 epoch now take form in a set 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.060
 suitable for the story that we are 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.819
 account the characters move 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.400
 twist they bend and die as could 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.260
 make it an articulated paper doll the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970
 also flat environment offers us 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.829
 different roads and heights routes 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.319
 hidden and blocked as well as 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.299
 different ambience is all this are 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.790
 a very limited color palette but 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.630
 that is enough to evoke that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.090
 time 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.550
 if in the visual apofenia we like the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 playable because we are also not facing a 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.320
 simple action platform game is 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.060
 something richer in options make us with 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.910
 weapons with which to attack jazz on swords 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.350
 axes spears or bow and arrows 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 equip them with better and better shields 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.180
 and have thrown weapons is only the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.220
 principle and that is that we should look 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 too many elements with 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.960
 what to create or crafter in order to equip us 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.120
 with health potions or elements with the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.300
 to rebuild weapons 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.950
 since these are destroyed with the use by 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.170
 it is important to destroy all the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.790
 elements of the environment as we can like this 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 how to eliminate all the enemies that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.560
 get ahead to get us 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.000
 different utensils in the part 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.770
 bottom of the screen we have good 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 account of the different weapons that 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.090
 we have at our disposal as well as 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.880
 from the life bar the shield and the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.560
 potions available human enemies 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.630
 Great soldiers traps and gods 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.000
 pissed off they will make use of all their 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.380
 deployment to finish with us 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.270
 the attacks have to be done with a 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.910
 correct timing if we want to have more 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.200
 life expectancy that go to the fool or the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.110
 attack without rhyme or reason 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.610
 is to die almost always use the shield 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.920
 dodge attacks and attack when the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.930
 enemy is more vulnerable is a thousand times 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.879
 more effective but sometimes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.190
 we will be cornered and we have to 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.780
 look for a better strategy like 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.840
 make us invisible to pass 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.010
 unnoticed for example the Olympus is 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.660
 so big and vast that we can 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.700
 transport us to the place where we want 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.920
 we always know two points of travel 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.150
 fast the game area is opening up to 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.730
 our feet providing the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.250
 different objectives at the same time is 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.569
 our choice to go towards one or the other and 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.819
 that is, opening the door 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.160
 corresponding and select our 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.579
 most suitable strategy to fulfill said 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.859
 mission 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.989
 this adventure ends up trapping for its 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.940
 aesthetic and for its gameplay showing its 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.460
 game depth according to more 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.169
 We delve into your proposal for those 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.270
 who like to complete 100% 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.550
 Game indicate that manuscripts and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.010
 information to be collected distributed by 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.380
 the whole game to potions a downloadable 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.639
 that should not go unnoticed and that you 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.580
 makes enjoy from the first moment 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.530
 that tests it also offers 4 sands 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.090
 those that challenge us against another player in 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.790
 local 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.910
 an addition to the original chicha that is 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.610
 the individual adventure pity that this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.160
 product is completely in English and 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.870
 This can stop more than one despite 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.380
 that the language of the sword is 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.380
 universal
