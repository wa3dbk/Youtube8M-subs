actually I played this game called
SpiderMonkey<00:01:18.979> we<00:01:19.670> had<00:01:19.819> this<00:01:19.970> really<00:01:20.210> huge

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
SpiderMonkey we had this really huge

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.440 
SpiderMonkey we had this really huge
like<00:01:21.799> web<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.369> was<00:01:22.490> basically<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.819> metal<00:01:23.090> web

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
like web it was basically a metal web

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.300 
like web it was basically a metal web
that<00:01:23.899> went<00:01:24.049> out<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.350> dome<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.069> climb

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
that went out like a dome and you climb

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.279 
that went out like a dome and you climb

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289
