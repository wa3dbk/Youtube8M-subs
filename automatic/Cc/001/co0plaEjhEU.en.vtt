00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 one month after leaving office 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.880
 paulo ney franco's Overview 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 to defuse the environment in morumbi 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 in an interview to the newspaper the globe the ex 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
 saulo coach said rogério 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.500
 Ceni boss in the dressing room and club 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 said more said goose is being 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 fried by the captain are Pauline 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.390
 fernando faro covers são paulo and can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.190
 have some details of this information 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 of the former technician of são paulo morelli 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 monkey in the west of são paulo the environment 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.129
 do são paulo knows that rogério ceni has 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 a very great ancestry over the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.149
 cast on the technical committee on the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.489
 This is no secret to anyone. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.129
 the goalkeeper really has a political weight 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.680
 important everyone knows this much 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 that the political currents of different 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 do são paulo always try to join the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 player and what the hell did he say 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 may have a little overdone 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.829
 suddenly in the way with it said 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.629
 but he's not talking nonsense 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.729
 rogério ceni has a very large weight 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.619
 They are not paulo now with regard to frying 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.540
 the player paulo henrique goose is worth 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.740
 remember that the goose had numerous 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.659
 opportunities during the year 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 especially in this season when he 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 was in better physical conditions than 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.479
 has yielded the expected but we know how 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.369
 already has a history although it is a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 winner by São Paulo nobody tested the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.369
 This no one doubts your love for 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.170
 club 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.420
 He has his moments when he thinks 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.890
 there is one especially for having too much 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.479
 São Paulo time to try this 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930
 history of being singled out as the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
 São Paulo idol then the rogério has 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.229
 yes one side a little different the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.850
 fan is not accustomed to the sale of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.119
 chicken may have exaggerated a bit 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.950
 in dose but did not say any nonsense to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.649
 who knows the backstage knows as well as 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.079
 already a difficult person to deal with 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.380
 and as it has only the whole cheer your 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.369
 Please, it is very easy to 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.810
 to reconcile things the way he 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.590
 find morumbi more suitable but it is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.579
 possible a team captain is to judge a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.399
 player 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.450
 the sooner or the later it is his to join the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.580
 casting approve or disapprove is allowed 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.770
 this from the environment 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.290
 do são paulo and if rogério really does 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.090
 does this he must do this with the endorsement 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.150
 how do you see this 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.150
 situation 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 Everyone knows in Morumbi that who 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.740
 hit the front with rogério ceni vai 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.300
 lose the independence of a president 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.890
 be the coach with the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.420
 we saw in the case of French or be a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.670
 good player rogério ceni has one 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.810
 Fantastic story with Sao Paulo I think 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.660
 This has to be clear to everyone. 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.000
 here is questioning that rogério did 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.650
 and will still do for São Paulo by 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.360
 love he has the são paulo point is not 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.820
 this now just for having you 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.220
 fool backing the history it ends 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.660
 This type of force has the directors 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.160
 You know it's no good for you to hit 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 with the player he is the idol of the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.820
 Largest crooked idol the player has more 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.950
 a thousand games for the club and scored more than 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.170
 100 goals for the club has won countless 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.510
 he is the personification of the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.910
 Paul then we talk about passion 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.740
 You do not want to be rational in 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.940
 works if someone criticizes rogério ceni 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.890
 have you seen what happened to adalberto 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.870
 Baptist was the president's strongman 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.520
 juvenile juvêncio criticized rogério ceni 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.400
 spoke of the creation of a 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.780
 ball and was fired by the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.730
 Youth President Juvêncio then this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.560
 more or less an idea of ​​the strength of the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.019
 rangers entered the locker room is the scenario 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.250
 ideal is not the player should not have 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.989
 this type of assignment 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.360
 But Sao Paulo, we know that 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.680
 happens a bit differently from what we 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.810
 when, precisely because of this 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.209
 ancestry of the rogério he does have this 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.250
 political weight then usually the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.650
 coaches just was not just ney franc 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.200
 muricy ramon adilson batista lion 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.630
 several had suggestions from the goalkeeper 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.310
 rogério ceni and accepted as a matter of 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.260
 policy also now also worth saying 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.600
 ney frank he left when he 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.760
 left sao paulo and was very thoughtful 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.530
 in his settings thanked and praised 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.880
 the whole cast but he started to take 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 fucking everything that was there in the rogério 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.200
 even gave the strongest 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.790
 statements saying that the legacy of the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.070
 last 12 months period that coincided 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.410
 with Frank Ney's stay in the club was 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.040
 zero and I'm going to excuse another new oil 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.750
 technician 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.060
 now yes the paulo will have command then 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.310
 every action causes a reaction then 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.019
 Maybe I exaggerated a bit, but I 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.519
 I find particularly he did not invent 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.680
 nothing that he said that love is of 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.750
 do you think it can not be a 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.269
 retaliation of the ney franc to those of 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.730
 prayers and rogério ceni how to have left 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.480
 a legacy 0 in morumbi 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.910
 ney franco coy ney franco sao paulo 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.000
 this period always seemed a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.790
 calm weighted coach is that I 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.700
 A lot of day the words at the time of speaking are 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.670
 and he gave this interview I mean is the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.010
 ney franc is very safe and is at your 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.900
 see all that he said so I 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.550
 know the backstage of são paulo 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.310
 worked a year knows well how things 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.590
 unfold in the locker room and ney franc 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.540
 It is what I remember from memory. 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.180
 first and only coach who beat 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.640
 effectively with rogério this in the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.750
 counterpart of honor match 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.090
 I'm not morumbi by the South American Cup. 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.340
 that episode rogério ceni wanted 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.960
 the cícero were pro team sat in 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.210
 bank of reserves that player of more 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.210
 presence of ney area and opted for the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.100
 inem josé rogério gesticulou 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.630
 arbitrarily until it receives a little and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.580
 ney franco at the press conference said 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.410
 who did not like and publicly criticized the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.240
 rogério is from there the thing 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.850
 has degradoolou enough the relationship 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.680
 sour and then the rogério with all the force 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.210
 that he has behind the scenes he is a 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.830
 player who has a lot of influence over 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.020
 the younger ones about the other leaders 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.240
 the cast is very difficult to beat 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.810
 with rogério and end up leading to 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.820
 best 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.340
 so frank ney now waited a month 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.020
 slaughter quite caught you have to 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.250
 Remembering that, he also said some 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.900
 things and I believe he will 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.400
 collect and leave the dust a little 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.050
 download I think he gave the message that he 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.700
 I wanted to now let's see how things 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.050
 unfold if the rogério will speak 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.030
 Something this board is going to 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.320
 position I particularly believe 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.030
 which directors will also try 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.740
 let the dust settle down because 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.120
 Paulo is very upset 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.940
 will have another controversy especially 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.860
 now that são paulo won the 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.960
 benfica managed to interrupt this series 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.880
 of 14 games without victory all that the club 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.919
 need not now is a new crisis 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.280
 especially with the greatest idol of his 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.280
 story
