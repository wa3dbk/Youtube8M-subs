00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all these blabla maxims and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 welcome to a new short video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 so so today bah I'm going to talk 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 of a small subject to which I am 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.700
 confronted quite seldom it happens 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.910
 maybe once both or 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 three without comment but from time to time 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 time it happens that there are people who 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 do not ask that they tell me but you 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.730
 do not you think you 're not a real guy 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
 so every time I see that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.900
 makes me smile and I ask myself 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.939
 question finally it's all stupid but 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 what is it to be a real guy because 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.800
 i can not get the jrc not really she 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 will define except maybe the fact that I 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 think the people who say that is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.469
 compared to my cut the fact that I 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.390
 do not be one of the most muscular of my life 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 and that I do not know I wear who 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.180
 t-shirt sees kids from 14 to 15 years old 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.800
 I do not know and that's it but what is it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 what is good without being a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.670
 real man it would be so well that's 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 the inverted a priori it is done to have 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.359
 hair short hair and a beard 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 lumberjack muscles at home 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.129
 how are we going in street fighter and was 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.490
 not shirt 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.950
 here we are finally here but but that's what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.570
 that it's being a lawyer is a real guy 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.920
 or am I a fake but blow 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.560
 what is it that makes the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900
 difference between a real and a fake game 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.040
 I do not know French that which because he 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.509
 a moment ago I find that this kind of 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 notice it's always part of 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 same people these people there are 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.759
 make 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290
 finally there is always one side I tell you 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.759
 that but at the same time I 'm proving badly 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 that I am a real dude because I 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.590
 I am with because and so that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 that's it when I swear to you that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 looking at my own life the people 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.079
 that we use that is people who 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.640
 bat are a bit closed homophobic etc and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.350
 who are constantly trying to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.970
 prove a manhood that ultimately 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 maybe not I even you maybe a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.729
 sexual problem I do not know because he 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 a moment ago me what I have in the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.409
 underpants 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 well I 'm nothing his game does tak 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.380
 tak 30 left there is a trick that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 gigote here it is finally I know it's 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.070
 a boy that goes no further than that and 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 That's why 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.000
 by my my life we ​​are things I 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.710
 could have hair three or 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.110
 four times longer makeup 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 Spread full mouth I do not know 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.420
 even to be dressed as a woman with 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.009
 high heels 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.720
 as long as there is what is what I have 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.510
 in the slip ben that makes me a 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.130
 boy is time that if I had not and 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.330
 if you are a girl 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.620
 finally it's a girl I'm going to avoid 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.150
 you see, we may not be 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.340
 still morals but if you are a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 girl and that good there is a moment where everything 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.870
 nothing in the pants and you have I do not 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.000
 know you shave the hair you put 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.459
 to a football shirt you make arms of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 of two by a physical try to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.950
 bring things closer yes you 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.680
 would look a little bit more like a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.380
 woman so here's a girl a girl that 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 the chocolates etc of lacoste and 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.519
 lesbians that's because after there is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.769
 other than our criterion of sexuality 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.170
 who comes in if you are not a real guy 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.680

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 that I found it interesting 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.070
 finally because that's what it is 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.140
 it's a real guy, knowing that 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.970
 century in the water after with opening 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.030
 as we count we are supposed to have 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.610
 Thursday is still at school we have 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.250

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.330
 of documentation is what we are still 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 at this point you read is going to be a real 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.590
 dude that's it while while the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.840
 society we are still looking for a threshold 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.100
 of equality between the two sexes even if 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.480
 good after all this is a question of 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.810
 point of view and what what after 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.280
 everyone has to keep his place or not 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.950
