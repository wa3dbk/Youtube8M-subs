the hobby and why I'm so passionate
about<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.570> as<00:01:44.750> well<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:45.410> not<00:01:45.440> only<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
about it as well so it's not only the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:58.750 
about it as well so it's not only the
cars<00:01:46.220> for<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.640> people<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:47.090> well

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.400 

be<00:01:59.360> 10<00:01:59.630> is<00:02:00.040> number<00:02:01.040> 36<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.640> 44<00:02:02.180> built<00:02:02.810> there's

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
be 10 is number 36 of 44 built there's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.050 
be 10 is number 36 of 44 built there's
not<00:02:03.620> another<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.460> North<00:02:04.880> or<00:02:05.030> South

not another one in in North or South

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.160 
not another one in in North or South
America<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.840> know<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.640> b7s<00:02:08.690> is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
America that I know of and the b7s is

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.970 
America that I know of and the b7s is
number<00:02:09.470> 26<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.240> 33<00:02:11.240> built<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.690> believe<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.230> if

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
number 26 of 33 built I believe and if

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.410 
number 26 of 33 built I believe and if
there's<00:02:13.340> only<00:02:13.400> two<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.910> United<00:02:14.210> States

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
there's only two in the United States

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120 
there's only two in the United States
today<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.020> think<00:02:15.410> there's<00:02:15.530> only<00:02:15.590> 9<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
today I think there's only 9 in the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.720 
today I think there's only 9 in the
world<00:02:16.340> left<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.660> b10<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.470> believe<00:02:18.980> there's<00:02:19.220> 14

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
world left the b10 I believe there's 14

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.150 
world left the b10 I believe there's 14
left<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> world<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:21.590> are<00:02:21.710> registered

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
left in the world that are registered

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.820 
left in the world that are registered
today<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:22.690> they're<00:02:23.690> pretty<00:02:23.930> rare<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.590> pretty

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
today so they're pretty rare it's pretty

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.059 
today so they're pretty rare it's pretty
rare<00:02:25.010> car
