00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 the body is growing 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.340
 and to the soul of moment 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.170
 a lot of people have played with this mix between my apple 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.119
 Dad is going to happen 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.299
 on Monday to microsoft that after being medicated 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.910
 but computing the battle beyond the area extends to all markets 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.020
 are millions in investments to reach even more users. 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.520
 advertising campaigns were created based on this rivalry 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.900
 it would be impossible to imagine these technological powers within the same 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 environment right well no more knew the crac fifth post what has been 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.559
 modified to work with the apple operating system some users 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.860
 have managed through many modifications to do what works 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.760
 the face of a little more with the body of another 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.409
 the proposal is a little practice. 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.200
 modify the operating system at the time it 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.260
 I was going to give normal counters the pcs of life 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.300
 but of all computer because the apple operating system can not in thesis 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.880
 even the processors manufactured by mitsubishi prey what exists 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 different on the radio so that the new pilots 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.800
 the answer is at liberty 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 worry we have a diverse range and video cards 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.900
 the apple only to the puma the certain video card 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.790
 do not ask for pain for example the apple did some processor sentence that she 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.980
 cause as well as the new video cards coming in now 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.140
 the new doctors at the time I come back, amy lived for example for I want this 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 video card I'm going to die she's missed 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.520
 this happens in the world realize why I posted and legs and videos 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.370
 it kind of emotion memories to save the drivers own view 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.900
 of these components exactly why pc can run the mac 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.460
 and even because nowadays the honor of the mac resembles much to grow platform 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.160
 intel 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.240
 the time and set up a platform so exclusive and closed because its products 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 ended up with a higher price 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.450
 all competition that is the bad side of history the good side is that by the fact 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 to have a greater control in the assembly and in the optimization of the parts 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.099
 the system is more secure and reliable, even if it is true, but the 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.980
 that would only lock the application used and not the system as a whole 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.659
 this of course does not happen in a mouse in logs which may have several memories 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.409
 different manufacturers from the process of rocky cool to run the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.299
 mac operating system taken as illegal but pay attention if you 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.020
 bought a pc it is yours and if you bought the apple operating system 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.969
 he is yours too 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.309
 yesterday is the problem or modify something that is your right to run the 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:51.169
 operative system if you bought it from Galapagos island 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.430
 another operating system that would give an iphone and to access content that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.549
 is available in your country in case the raptors are all right and within 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.199

 with photo 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.019

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.919
 so that the apple system can on your pc one of them is to create a machine 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.860

 Another solution is to use softwares to modify the look of your 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
