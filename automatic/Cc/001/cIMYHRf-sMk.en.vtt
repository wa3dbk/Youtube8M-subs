taken the back frame as I call it off
the<00:02:20.400> initial<00:02:21.400> frame<00:02:21.879> itself<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.540> main<00:02:22.720> frame

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the initial frame itself the main frame

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.550 
the initial frame itself the main frame
and<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.930> do<00:02:26.050> get<00:02:26.290> some

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
inserts there and of course you have the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.670 
inserts there and of course you have the
blade<00:02:29.680> name<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.340> logo<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.330> side<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.650> you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
blade name a logo on the side so you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.830 
blade name a logo on the side so you
it's<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.459> basically<00:02:34.000> made<00:02:34.269> out<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.599> an

it's just basically made out of an
aircraft<00:02:35.170> grade<00:02:35.830> aluminium<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.780> there<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.959> go

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
aircraft grade aluminium and there we go

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.660 
aircraft grade aluminium and there we go
you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> closer<00:02:38.739> look<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.990 
you can have a closer look at the
inserts<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.950> there<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.340> put<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.879> of

inserts and you see there I put one of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.110 
inserts and you see there I put one of
the<00:02:43.060> dots<00:02:43.299> on<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.900> top<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.790> two<00:02:45.790> down

upwards and of course you're inserting
the<00:03:57.310> phone<00:03:57.519> from<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.359> back<00:03:58.569> so<00:03:59.609> basically<00:04:00.609> you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the phone from the back so basically you

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.970 
the phone from the back so basically you
tilt<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> top<00:04:01.540> right-hand<00:04:01.840> corner<00:04:02.139> in<00:04:02.590> first

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
tilt the top right-hand corner in first

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.180 
tilt the top right-hand corner in first
and<00:04:03.280> then<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.150> gradually<00:04:04.569> just<00:04:05.109> let<00:04:06.069> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
and then just gradually just let the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.809 
and then just gradually just let the
phone<00:04:06.630> sit<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.139> frame<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.459> there<00:04:09.639> you<00:04:09.700> go

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
phone sit in the frame so there you go

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.640 
phone sit in the frame so there you go
there's<00:04:10.000> no<00:04:10.090> issues<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:11.079> course<00:04:11.349> if<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> can

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
there's no issues and of course if I can

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.650 
there's no issues and of course if I can
just<00:04:11.829> show<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.099> quickly<00:04:12.299> though<00:04:13.299> where<00:04:13.540> the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
just show you quickly though where the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.110 
just show you quickly though where the
buttons<00:04:13.959> actually<00:04:14.230> touch<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:15.760> they<00:04:15.970> are

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
buttons actually touch that they are

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.460 
buttons actually touch that they are
protected<00:04:16.720> I'm<00:04:16.810> not<00:04:16.959> going<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.200> rub<00:04:17.349> away

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
protected I'm not going to rub away

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.460 
protected I'm not going to rub away
anywhere<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:19.150> I'll<00:04:19.419> get<00:04:19.599> the<00:04:19.690> backplate<00:04:20.169> here

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
anywhere so I'll get the backplate here

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.520 
anywhere so I'll get the backplate here
now<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.979> they'll<00:04:21.760> now<00:04:22.210> just<00:04:22.570> speed<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.500> along

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
now and they'll now just speed it along

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.700 
now and they'll now just speed it along
a<00:04:23.710> bit<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.159> in

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
a bit and in

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.340 
a bit and in
set<00:04:24.889> the<00:04:25.280> four<00:04:25.729> screws<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:26.930> what<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.169> do<00:04:27.319> have

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
set the four screws but what you do have

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.469 
set the four screws but what you do have
to<00:04:27.710> bear<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:28.009> mind<00:04:28.069> is<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.819> these<00:04:29.060> screws

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
to bear in mind is that these screws

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.689 
to bear in mind is that these screws
even<00:04:29.870> though<00:04:30.020> as<00:04:30.259> tough<00:04:30.470> as<00:04:30.620> they<00:04:30.800> are<00:04:31.009> they

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
even though as tough as they are they

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.790 
even though as tough as they are they
can<00:04:32.090> be<00:04:32.120> snapped<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.110> course<00:04:33.349> they<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.770> be

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
can be snapped and of course they can be

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.700 
can be snapped and of course they can be
stripped<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:35.060> great<00:04:35.990> care<00:04:36.259> should<00:04:36.289> be<00:04:36.620> taken

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
stripped so great care should be taken

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.120 
stripped so great care should be taken
to<00:04:37.360> not<00:04:38.360> over<00:04:38.930> tighten<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.410> screws<00:04:39.710> once

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
to not over tighten the screws once

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.969 
to not over tighten the screws once
you're<00:04:40.340> inserting<00:04:40.729> them<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:42.590> don't<00:04:42.740> need

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
you're inserting them and you don't need

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.749 
you're inserting them and you don't need
to<00:04:43.130> go<00:04:43.280> overboard<00:04:43.789> with<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.840> tightness<00:04:45.759> once

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
to go overboard with the tightness once

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.999 
to go overboard with the tightness once
that<00:04:47.060> once<00:04:47.330> it's<00:04:47.539> clamped<00:04:47.840> down<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.410> in

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
that once it's clamped down and in

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.050 
that once it's clamped down and in
together<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.660> its<00:04:50.990> place<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:52.550> give<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.030> a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
together and in its place and give you a

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.170 
together and in its place and give you a
closer<00:04:53.300> look<00:04:53.479> of<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.410> backplate<00:04:55.400> there<00:04:55.669> as

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
closer look of the backplate there as

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.300 
closer look of the backplate there as
you<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.419> see<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:56.780> have<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.229> aluminium<00:04:57.620> battery

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
you can see I have the aluminium battery

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.640 
you can see I have the aluminium battery
backplate<00:04:58.849> on<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.570> as<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.930> see<00:05:00.139> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
backplate on and as you can see the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.870 
backplate on and as you can see the
combination<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.370> two

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
combination of the two

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.290 
combination of the two
looks<00:05:02.479> rather<00:05:03.729> spectacular<00:05:04.729> as<00:05:04.880> far<00:05:05.120> as<00:05:05.180> I'm

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
looks rather spectacular as far as I'm

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.770 
looks rather spectacular as far as I'm
concerned<00:05:05.810> you<00:05:06.320> do<00:05:06.440> get<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.860> small<00:05:07.599> lay<00:05:08.599> on<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
concerned you do get a small lay on the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.110 
concerned you do get a small lay on the
table<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:09.259> the<00:05:09.410> back<00:05:09.620> as<00:05:09.860> well<00:05:10.099> as<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.759> the

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
table on the back as well as on the

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.830 
table on the back as well as on the
front<00:05:11.360> you'll<00:05:12.289> see<00:05:12.380> that<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.830> frame<00:05:13.840> bumper

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
front you'll see that the frame bumper

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.450 
front you'll see that the frame bumper
doesn't<00:05:15.289> actually<00:05:15.710> interfere<00:05:16.099> with<00:05:16.220> any<00:05:16.340> of

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
to get your finger in there and turn it

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.730 
to get your finger in there and turn it
on<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.400> off<00:05:55.490> but<00:05:56.389> for<00:05:56.690> some<00:05:57.139> people<00:05:57.289> you<00:05:57.620> might

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
on and off but for some people you might

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.209 
on and off but for some people you might
have<00:05:57.949> big<00:05:58.190> fingers<00:05:58.639> and<00:05:59.440> might<00:06:00.440> cross<00:06:01.009> some

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
have big fingers and might cross some

issue<00:06:01.400> now<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.419> headphone<00:06:02.750> jack<00:06:02.780> itself<00:06:03.409> is

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
issue now the headphone jack itself is

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.060 
issue now the headphone jack itself is
recessed<00:06:04.909> so<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:05.900> will<00:06:06.139> have<00:06:06.349> problems<00:06:06.800> if

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
recessed so you will have problems if

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.370 
recessed so you will have problems if

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
you use DJ style headphones because they

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.580 
you use DJ style headphones because they
tend<00:06:09.830> to<00:06:09.919> come<00:06:10.130> with<00:06:10.190> a<00:06:10.610> very<00:06:11.150> large<00:06:11.300> 3.5<00:06:12.289> milk

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
tend to come with a very large 3.5 milk

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.740 
tend to come with a very large 3.5 milk
you<00:06:13.520> do<00:06:13.639> have<00:06:13.849> an<00:06:13.969> opening<00:06:14.210> there<00:06:14.389> for<00:06:14.599> your

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
you do have an opening there for your

you do have an opening there for your
secondary<00:06:15.259> microphone<00:06:15.889> and<00:06:16.099> then<00:06:16.699> of<00:06:16.789> course

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
secondary microphone and then of course

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.779 
secondary microphone and then of course
as<00:06:17.270> you<00:06:17.300> can<00:06:17.509> see<00:06:17.719> there<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:18.199> the<00:06:18.289> left<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:18.830> the

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
as you can see there to the left is the

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.959 
as you can see there to the left is the
sleep/wake<00:06:20.509> one<00:06:20.780> now<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.530> is<00:06:21.650> I've
