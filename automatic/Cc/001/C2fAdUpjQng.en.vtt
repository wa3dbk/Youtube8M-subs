00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.920 
learned from the online program that the
more<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.309> think<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.510> really<00:01:01.780> have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
more I think that that you really have

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.240 
more I think that that you really have
to<00:01:02.049> study<00:01:02.229> a<00:01:02.350> lot<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.909> don't<00:01:03.909> think<00:01:04.619> without<00:01:05.619> all

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
to study a lot I don't think without all

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.460 
to study a lot I don't think without all
of<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.549> information<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.180> were<00:01:07.299> given<00:01:07.600> I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
of the information that we were given I

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.950 
of the information that we were given I
would<00:01:09.159> have<00:01:09.280> been<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> successful<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.509> I<00:01:10.720> also

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
would have been a successful and I also

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.410 
would have been a successful and I also
think<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.560> chef<00:01:11.830> mentoring<00:01:12.280> was<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.150> huge

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
think that the chef mentoring was a huge

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.120 
think that the chef mentoring was a huge
part<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:13.870> it<00:01:14.320> was<00:01:14.470> nice<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.830> be<00:01:14.920> able<00:01:14.980> to

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
part of it it was nice to be able to

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.380 
part of it it was nice to be able to
call<00:01:15.280> chef<00:01:15.490> mark<00:01:15.730> whenever<00:01:16.030> had<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.180> question

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
call chef mark whenever had a question

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.080 
call chef mark whenever had a question
or<00:01:16.930> whenever<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.500> needed<00:01:17.680> help<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:18.220> didn't<00:01:19.030> think

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
or whenever I needed help I didn't think

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.490 
or whenever I needed help I didn't think
I<00:01:19.300> could<00:01:19.330> actually<00:01:19.630> do<00:01:19.900> my<00:01:20.020> training<00:01:20.350> online

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
I could actually do my training online

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.910 
I could actually do my training online
at<00:01:21.130> first<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.850> when<00:01:22.210> Josh<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.470> had<00:01:23.650> spoken

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
at first and when Josh and I had spoken

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.420 
at first and when Josh and I had spoken
I<00:01:24.420> decided<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.659> give<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.140> shot<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.650> ended<00:01:27.340> up

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
I decided to give it a shot and ended up

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.100 
I decided to give it a shot and ended up
really<00:01:27.700> really<00:01:27.940> like<00:01:28.180> in<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.360> program<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.900> it

just as much of an education going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.999 
just as much of an education going
through<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> online<00:02:03.749> program<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.799> would

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
through the online program as I would

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
through the online program as I would
have<00:02:05.130> spending<00:02:05.700> eighty<00:02:05.880> thousand<00:02:06.299> dollars<00:02:06.539> on

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
have spending eighty thousand dollars on

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
have spending eighty thousand dollars on
the<00:02:06.780> two-year<00:02:07.049> program<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the two-year program I think the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.639 
the two-year program I think the
difference<00:02:08.580> between<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.780> two<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
difference between the two is that the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.550 
difference between the two is that the
on-site<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.790> had<00:02:12.690> two<00:02:12.870> amazing<00:02:12.989> chef

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
on-site I had two amazing chef

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000 
on-site I had two amazing chef
instructors<00:02:14.129> there<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.319> did<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.650> get

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
instructors there but we did not get

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.210 
instructors there but we did not get
enough<00:02:17.310> time<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.739> program<00:02:19.950> online

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
enough time and with the program online

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.640 
enough time and with the program online
you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.269> take<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.599> time<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.319> instead<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
you can take your time so instead of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.140 
you can take your time so instead of
trying<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> cram<00:02:23.340> everything<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
trying to cram everything in in a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.089 
trying to cram everything in in a
certain<00:02:24.329> amount<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.629> time<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.829> little<00:02:26.010> bit

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
certain amount of time it's a little bit

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.160 
certain amount of time it's a little bit
more<00:02:26.220> spaced<00:02:26.519> out<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:28.049> on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
more spaced out so you have the one on

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.680 
more spaced out so you have the one on
one<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:29.250> don't<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.610> one-on-one<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.239> much

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
one you don't get the one-on-one as much

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.600 
one you don't get the one-on-one as much
as<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.290> trip<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> traditional<00:02:31.980> school<00:02:32.400> I
