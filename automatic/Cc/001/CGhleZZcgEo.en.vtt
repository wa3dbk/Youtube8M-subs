00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.200 
exorcists have been nothing but a myth
to<00:01:45.049> mr.<00:01:45.319> Pamuk<00:01:45.499> before<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.340> he<00:01:46.759> questioned

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
to mr. Pamuk before so he questioned

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.359 
to mr. Pamuk before so he questioned
Lucian<00:01:47.630> story<00:01:48.049> but<00:01:48.590> he's<00:01:48.770> still<00:01:48.979> curious

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
Lucian story but he's still curious

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.340 
Lucian story but he's still curious
enough<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.789> follow<00:01:50.119> her<00:01:50.389> to<00:01:50.539> London<00:01:50.719> on<00:01:51.079> his

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
enough to follow her to London on his

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.139 
enough to follow her to London on his
journey<00:01:51.770> something<00:01:52.310> happens<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.939> changes

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
journey something happens that changes

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.389 
journey something happens that changes
his<00:01:53.780> view<00:01:54.049> on<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:54.499> cold<00:01:54.710> world<00:01:54.859> completely

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
his view on your cold world completely

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.489 
his view on your cold world completely
so<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.030> third<00:01:56.240> part<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.749> story<00:01:57.020> happens

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
so the third part of the story happens

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.190 
so the third part of the story happens
within<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> two<00:01:58.159> main<00:01:58.369> ones<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.999> solve<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.840> by

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
within the two main ones I solve this by

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.199 
within the two main ones I solve this by
putting<00:02:00.499> it<00:02:00.679> into<00:02:00.889> little<00:02:01.130> Eppler<00:02:01.759> hoax<00:02:01.969> and

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
putting it into little Eppler hoax and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.760 
putting it into little Eppler hoax and
splitting<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.780> epilogues<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.590> between

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
splitting the epilogues up in between

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.760 
splitting the epilogues up in between
the<00:02:04.039> main<00:02:04.249> chapters<00:02:04.719> but<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:05.899> will<00:02:06.049> see<00:02:06.259> so

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the main chapters but you will see so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.559 
the main chapters but you will see so
the<00:02:06.889> third<00:02:07.100> story<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.700> moles<00:02:07.999> on<00:02:08.149> his<00:02:08.179> story

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
the third story is moles on his story

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.240 
the third story is moles on his story
he's<00:02:09.080> been<00:02:09.200> working<00:02:09.530> for<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.770> order<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
he's been working for the order of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
he's been working for the order of
exorcist<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:10.880> London<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.600> very<00:02:11.900> long<00:02:12.140> time

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
exorcist in London for a very long time

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.590 
exorcist in London for a very long time
so<00:02:13.040> he<00:02:13.190> knows<00:02:13.370> all<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.790> very<00:02:14.000> dark<00:02:14.300> things

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
so he knows all the very dark things

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.130 
so he knows all the very dark things
about<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:15.470> despite

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
about it but despite

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
about it but despite
that<00:02:16.260> he<00:02:16.800> still<00:02:17.040> got<00:02:17.190> faith<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.640> his<00:02:17.880> daughter

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that he still got faith in his daughter

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.540 
that he still got faith in his daughter
Lucia<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.750> his<00:02:19.230> work<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.710> he's<00:02:19.950> never<00:02:20.130> losing

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
Lucia and his work and he's never losing

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
Lucia and his work and he's never losing
hell<00:02:20.730> which<00:02:21.180> looking<00:02:21.810> at<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> story<00:02:22.290> seems

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
hell which looking at the story seems

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.340 
hell which looking at the story seems
kind<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.550> hard<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.330> these<00:02:24.569> three<00:02:24.870> stories

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
kind of hard so these three stories

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.080 
kind of hard so these three stories
connect<00:02:25.770> throughout<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> book<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.610> you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
connect throughout the book and you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.970 
connect throughout the book and you
might<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.630> read<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> twice<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.350> get<00:02:28.590> over

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
might have to read it twice to get over

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.460 
might have to read it twice to get over
them<00:02:29.130> details<00:02:29.520> write<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.390> story<00:02:30.780> jumps

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
them details write the story jumps

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
them details write the story jumps
through<00:02:31.980> different<00:02:32.490> times<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.030> different

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
through different times and different

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840 
through different times and different
universes<00:02:34.110> sometimes<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> same<00:02:35.310> time<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
universes sometimes at the same time and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.670 
universes sometimes at the same time and
it's<00:02:36.180> probably<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.840> hard<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.470> younger

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it's probably really hard for younger

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's probably really hard for younger
readers<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.250> understand<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.270> though

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
readers to understand all of it though

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
readers to understand all of it though
I've<00:02:39.750> really<00:02:40.050> tried<00:02:40.200> my<00:02:40.470> best<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.830> reach<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
I've really tried my best to reach a

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
I've really tried my best to reach a
younger<00:02:41.459> audience<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:42.150> 12<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
younger audience from 12 and up the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.740 
younger audience from 12 and up the
story<00:02:43.620> focuses<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.430> some<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:45.120> dark<00:02:45.300> themes

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
story focuses on some really dark themes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.010 
story focuses on some really dark themes
so<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.560> you're<00:02:46.770> not<00:02:47.010> into<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:47.690> don't<00:02:48.690> read<00:02:48.870> it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
so if you're not into this don't read it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
so if you're not into this don't read it
however<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> fan<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.550> fantasy<00:02:51.180> if
