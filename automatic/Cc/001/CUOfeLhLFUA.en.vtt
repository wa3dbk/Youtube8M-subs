tower<00:02:21.810> extremely<00:02:22.810> easy<00:02:22.930> there's<00:02:23.200> gas<00:02:23.380> shocks

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
tower extremely easy there's gas shocks

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.550 
tower extremely easy there's gas shocks
melts<00:02:24.370> into<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.700> tower<00:02:24.880> itself<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.410> can

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
melts into the tower itself so you can

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.770 
melts into the tower itself so you can
drop<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.010> erase<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.670> tower<00:02:27.850> with<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.480> hand

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
drop and erase the tower with one hand

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290 
drop and erase the tower with one hand
in<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.740> back<00:02:30.040> here<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.820> optional

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
in the back here we have the optional

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.930 
in the back here we have the optional
plug-and-play<00:02:31.750> ballast<00:02:32.530> system<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.730> can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
plug-and-play ballast system so you can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.820 
plug-and-play ballast system so you can
add<00:02:34.210> extra<00:02:34.600> weight<00:02:34.960> through<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.380> automatic

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
add extra weight through the automatic

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.850 
add extra weight through the automatic
system<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.700> make<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> wake<00:02:37.120> bigger<00:02:37.740> Malibu<00:02:38.740> is

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
system to make the wake bigger Malibu is

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.500 
system to make the wake bigger Malibu is
very<00:02:39.100> well<00:02:39.310> known<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.520> their<00:02:39.790> wake<00:02:39.970> enhancing

in 2013 let's get out on the water and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:04:16.270 
in 2013 let's get out on the water and
see<00:02:48.070> how<00:02:48.100> each<00:02:48.340> system<00:02:48.640> performs
