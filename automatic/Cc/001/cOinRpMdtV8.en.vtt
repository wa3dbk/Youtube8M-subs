just a little bit and just push it up so
I<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.899> teeny<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.500> amount

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
I have just a little teeny about amount

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.170 
I have just a little teeny about amount
of<00:00:47.250> volume<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> top<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.989> head

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.800 

and<00:00:54.920> bring<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.130> your<00:00:56.310> hair<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:56.940> side

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.840 

now<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.870> most<00:01:02.130> important<00:01:03.130> part<00:01:03.520> of<00:01:03.700> this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
now the most important part of this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.410 
now the most important part of this
hairdo<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.800> that<00:01:05.800> each<00:01:06.070> strand<00:01:06.550> has<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.210> same

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
hairdo is that each strand has the same

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.660 
hairdo is that each strand has the same
amount<00:01:07.660> of<00:01:07.840> hair<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:08.860> you're<00:01:09.040> going<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.370> start

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
amount of hair so you're going to start

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.820 
amount of hair so you're going to start
by<00:01:10.120> sectioning<00:01:10.390> off<00:01:10.690> your<00:01:10.870> hair<00:01:11.020> into<00:01:11.440> five

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
by sectioning off your hair into five

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
by sectioning off your hair into five
strands<00:01:12.690> start<00:01:13.690> with<00:01:14.170> right<00:01:14.800> at<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.220> base<00:01:15.430> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
strands start with right at the base of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:44.380 
strands start with right at the base of
your<00:01:17.500> neck<00:01:17.770> not<00:01:18.729> next<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.330> ear

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.240 

and<00:01:44.510> just<00:01:45.200> make<00:01:45.350> sure<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.500> each<00:01:45.710> strand<00:01:45.979> has

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
and just make sure that each strand has

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.440 
and just make sure that each strand has
the<00:01:46.430> same<00:01:46.610> amount<00:01:46.820> of<00:01:46.850> hair<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.300> other

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the same amount of hair that the other

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.290 
the same amount of hair that the other
strands<00:01:47.750> have<00:01:47.990> they<00:01:48.860> don't<00:01:49.040> need<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.370> be<00:01:49.550> exact

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
strands have they don't need to be exact

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.740 
strands have they don't need to be exact
but<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.290> don't<00:01:51.470> want<00:01:51.680> one<00:01:52.340> side<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:53.119> run<00:01:53.600> out

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
but you don't want one side to run out

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.980 
but you don't want one side to run out
of<00:01:53.780> hair<00:01:54.050> before<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.590> rest<00:01:54.800> do<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.810> is

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
of hair before the rest do so this is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.340 
of hair before the rest do so this is
the<00:01:57.140> same<00:01:57.350> pattern<00:01:57.890> over<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:59.119> over<00:01:59.350> it's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
the same pattern over and over it's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.660 
the same pattern over and over it's
really<00:02:00.740> no<00:02:00.860> difficult<00:02:01.280> than<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.460> three

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
really no difficult than the three

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.310 
really no difficult than the three
strand<00:02:01.970> braid<00:02:02.030> it's<00:02:02.450> pretty<00:02:02.780> much<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.050> exact

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
strand braid it's pretty much the exact

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.290 
strand braid it's pretty much the exact
same<00:02:03.350> thing<00:02:03.590> you're<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.250> doing<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.790> two

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
same thing you're just doing it on two

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.109 
same thing you're just doing it on two
sides<00:02:05.570> as<00:02:05.900> opposed<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.410> side<00:02:06.650> so<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
sides as opposed to one side so the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.290 
sides as opposed to one side so the
pattern<00:02:08.539> never<00:02:08.750> changes<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.410> always

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
pattern never changes it's always

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
pattern never changes it's always
over-under<00:02:11.300> over-under

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
over-under over-under

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
over-under over-under
so<00:02:13.880> we're<00:02:14.060> going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.300> start<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> hair

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
so we're going to start with the hair

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.350 
so we're going to start with the hair
closest<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.739> your<00:02:15.860> face<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.239> it's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
closest to your face that's the one it's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.690 
closest to your face that's the one it's
in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.750> base<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:17.989> your<00:02:18.170> neck<00:02:18.440> you're<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:19.550> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
in the base of your neck you're going to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.670 
in the base of your neck you're going to
go<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.239> don't<00:02:20.989> know<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> can<00:02:21.350> see<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.709> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
you're going to go over the first

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.240 
you're going to go over the first
section<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.680> under<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.690> third<00:02:29.930> section<00:02:31.660> and

section and under the third section and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.680 
section and under the third section and

strand<00:04:19.880> braid<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.959> isn't<00:04:21.970> actually<00:04:22.970> any

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
strand braid that isn't actually any

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.340 
strand braid that isn't actually any
more<00:04:23.300> difficult<00:04:23.690> than<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> three<00:04:24.020> strand<00:04:24.289> braid

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
more difficult than a three strand braid

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.640 
more difficult than a three strand braid
it<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.949> takes<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.370> little<00:04:25.490> time<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.180> practice

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
it just takes a little time and practice

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.090 
it just takes a little time and practice
but<00:04:27.850> essentially<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.360> movement<00:04:30.289> is<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:31.070> same

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
but essentially the movement is the same

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.670 
but essentially the movement is the same
just<00:04:31.820> go<00:04:32.000> over<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.509> under<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.470> would

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
just go over and under like you would

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.670 
just go over and under like you would
with<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> three<00:04:34.070> strand<00:04:34.370> braid<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.530> then<00:04:36.530> you

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
with a three strand braid and then you

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.710 
with a three strand braid and then you
add<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> little<00:04:36.949> bandana<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.360> sort<00:04:38.660> of

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
add a little bandana and it sort of

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.420 
add a little bandana and it sort of
helps<00:04:39.190> give<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.340> more<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:41.120> bohemian<00:04:42.430> theme

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
helps give it more of a bohemian theme

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550 
helps give it more of a bohemian theme
