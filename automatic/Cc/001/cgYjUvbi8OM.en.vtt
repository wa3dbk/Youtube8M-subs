00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.719
 so hello to all this type of test drive 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.339
 us of the next bike is charge pack 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.980
 2 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:20.470
 he is a British assembly British 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.530
 completely means it is he and fix and not 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.000
 fix at the same time as a double hub 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.580
 rear hub 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440
 that is, you need to turn the wheel 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.930
 would be like either on a ratchet or 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.180
 just a fixed gear given 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.750
 the moment it stands on fixed 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.810
 broadcast 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.030
 and before it somehow slows down on it 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.520
 without brakes it is not clear why on 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.140
 fix brakes were done here like this and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.630
 kolkhoz I do not know I tried to slow down 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.489
 I can't do this, so I have to drive 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.090
 have some kind of experience all the same ride on 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:00.130
 This kind of technology and success is very 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.930
 light all tone 9 kilograms 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.860
 there are about 9 kilograms, he is really very 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.389
 easy according to him theta transfer 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.579
 enough for the eyes cheerfully 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.469
 speed up and at the same time 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.439
 support more or less adequate 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.179
 speed if you just go on the road here 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.409
 at the same time as the owner says like 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.899
 it's pretty good cross 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.950
 riding the spirit of bicycles one of them 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.369
 which ford and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.399
 and on this and says he was driving even better 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.409
 than the one on their worst wide wheels 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.270
 it's unclear why a veil can out 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.119
 for what else but on the other hand 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 if the road is bad you took it on yourself 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.950
 hung on his back and you can calmly 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.710
 push the weather mean here here 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.750
 there is nothing here there are no switches here 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.719
 there is no particular weight but here 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.729
 promax tick brakes narrow first 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.909
 such are actually roadbirds some 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 I not not go here what is strange you 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.140
 Well, most likely the usual factory 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.560
 some kind of steering wheel but i don't know 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.170
 what the fuck 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.170
 tires what tires 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.000
 ga 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.460
 well yes here I stand crawling on it i'm a chain 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.010
 ordinary principle for such and for all 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.840
 would we be their software and the like 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.100
 equipment here is generally very special 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.230
 tells and nothing really 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.800
 nothing is done all natural sake 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 weight saving 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.120
 Well, the principle of telling especially 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.120
 nothing let's go for a ride 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.680
 so we are very generally such a bike very 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.709
 interesting really especially not so 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.499
 Not at all, not once traveled Well, of course 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.160
 Well, such a rubber ride on asphalt 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.710
 Well, but this off-road 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.630
 not very much this a junction of irregularities 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:21.900
 pavement and not you think everything is felt and in 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.130
 the steering wheel and where it should be given here is why I 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.780
 did not understand what all the same here 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.960
 pretty much other little 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.750
 notation here but in general on the most 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.660
 the main thing is to catch this one 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.140
 moment 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.120
 41 yes you still it costs it like in 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.580
 Russian stores but it is a success 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.370
 ordered directly from Britain for 23,000 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.320
 23,000 turned out there discount there was an account 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.430
 40 percent and the delivery went somewhere 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.420
 at about 5000 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.840
 Well, he seemed to have come complete with 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.340
 it is one no records bathed 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.890
 here is the same owner already punched the front 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.570
 busy front seldom punching also 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.260
 the owner has already punched the back two times 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.360
 wheel means once on the rails 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.740
 conventional rail on the move and 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.800
 second time but just in the hole on the shelves 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.830
 because such wheels are certainly not by 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:30.080
 our roads do not like driving 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:32.060
 Here in general, it's all thanks for watching 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.330
 subscribe put likes and to new 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.330
 meeting
