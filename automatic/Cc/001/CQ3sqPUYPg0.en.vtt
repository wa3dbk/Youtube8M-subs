00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello to all julien initiation 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 and lilian georges 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.579
 physical trainer within the structure gold wester sport training 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.359
 we will find each month on the website toumi sport to address 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.189
 different physical preparation themes that can be adapted to all 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.560
 sports disciplines 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.179
 to start we will address a priority theme warming up 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.110
 will highlight especially the Russian warming which is a concept 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.250
 which will allow to heat the muscle inside 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.070
 by creating a phenomenon of pompons through concentric actions and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.820
 the eccentric muscle 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.990
 to increase vascularity and with blood circulation 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.230
 unlike a classic warm-up run - a 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.670
 cardio-respiratory exhaust this exhaust will help to limit 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.900
 actually the injuries at the muscular level 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.610
 and actually increase the temperature of the van hamma muscle when 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.440
 the first phase the judgment must consist in creating a contraction 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.299
 eccentric in the muscle 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.110
 so the muscle is going to work 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.540
 slackening ramp will happen to curb on the descent 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.540
 so we will start with the quadriceps escape 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.100
 so the beast purpose of descent on 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.950
 one leg 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.210
 and go back on two legs 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.470
 and little by little the goal is to get the maximum amplitude 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.360
 why the sense of lower and lower 300 congressists and thinking well may 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.480
 put the second leg on resale 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.950
 but still very much the eccentric work 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.060
 down at the quadriceps this tailor storms the minister 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 brakes the descent slow down to get a maximum 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.650
 making the balance sheet 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.250
 so we're going to leave on 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.610
 10 repetitions 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 how can we perform from 2 to 3 times 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 but still besides sought the maximum amplitude 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.410
 but we must also look for perfect symmetry and more work 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.900
 possible right so annalynne mccord 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.150
 unlike a classic warm-up the star to have fun 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.560
 we send it back mainly to heat the factors 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.369
 cardio-respiratory exhaust and this would also increase 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.099
 temperature and youth 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.330
 so there disappointed after German the wounds that tonight during the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.139
 meeting 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.419
 simply during a season completely found 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.419
 airbus has actually decreased 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.709
 so here I used a partner we want to maintain 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.689
 but it is also good to add that a simple support already the pole 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.610
 November 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.459
 it allows you to stay straight 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.459
 legarda the posture and blow to do the work alone 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.019
 after doing different sleights with his team we go 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.159
 now pass either not focus so that's where we understand everything 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.749
 interest 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.359
 and the phenomenon does not understand who will be created in three years 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.680
 the eccentric paz 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.080
 or the muscle is dragging downhill anyway to see and now 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.239
 can not focus that we are going to address 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.079
 so there the descent we will be on both feet 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.179
 and the ascent is safe one foot 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.299
 or we go down on both feet it goes back on one foot the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.389
 principle is always the same 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.450
 to fetch 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.249
 the maximum amplitude little by little 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.519
 respecting a perfect symmetry 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.139
 so always otherwise 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.999
 the other people now 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.849
 so we will not get out of it will go back on a well respected skin the fnsea is 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 concentrate and musk 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.329
 and so we can go 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.419
 of this repetition 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.259
 to ten 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.389
 and from three to five series 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.429
 well here is the same exercise can be performed at the calves 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.919
 so we will attack by the eccentric phase 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.179
 so we'll go up on more people 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.669
 and one leg penalties 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.209
 novel about the two days 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.169
 we do not censor 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.849
 the same when we go on the same number of repetitions itself even when 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.969
 series 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.959
 we will now address the concentrated face only at the level of the calves 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.529
 same principle as earlier in the quadriceps now we 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.069
 let's go up 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.669
 a leg and go down on blogs 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.399
 we ride on people 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.759
 we exchange on the help 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.759
 so I'm going back to her main levels of the hamstrings 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.419
 so with the help of a partner 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.209
 the goal gag to slow the descent to work the eccentric dough the intake 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.099
 very closely to gradually pour 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.919
 but the little maxim the theater the research 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.110
 so we want first of all the eccentric press 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.199
 by the time the bus to get to the bedside of his son and by the strong 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.090
 Decrease in the revenue of the social security 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.080
 survivor 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.990
 first of all to read them the different ways to warm up the members his 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.680
 career thanks to joe manchin 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.249
 we will now approach 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.979
 the upper limbs 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.900
 as always the same principle we will attack by contraction 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.889
 eccentric 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.629
 so the muscle frouses and the descent into hell 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:46.759
 in this way 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.550
 so we put ourselves in position 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.070
 only decency on each pot we know that people to go up and these 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.870
 people who are actually dating us 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.689
 we continue 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.520
 you are descending 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.289
 we go back up with people 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.289
 we actually decrease the work of the arms and work only 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.749
 the eccentric phase of the muscle 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.080
 and now so we're going to work the page 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.180
 concentrated 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.180
 this moment the muscle actually goes back 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.349
 in conclusion of the snow coming to adapt from 10 to 20 minutes in 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.819
 according to the time allotted by the session 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.300
 done 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.620
 just before the session of 2 to 5 minutes 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.449
 it will really help to reduce injuries 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.999
 during the season and during the session 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.219
