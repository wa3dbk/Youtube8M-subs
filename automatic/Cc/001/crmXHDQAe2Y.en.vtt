I'm one fire red fire rescue I pretty
much<00:01:03.879> will<00:01:04.150> say<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.510> mission<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.989> probably

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
much will say that mission is probably

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.020 
much will say that mission is probably
the<00:01:05.530> most<00:01:05.650> difficult<00:01:05.800> mission<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.400> game<00:01:06.610> with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
the most difficult mission the game with

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.420 
the most difficult mission the game with
time<00:01:07.440> factor<00:01:08.440> obviously<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:09.010> don't<00:01:09.190> have<00:01:09.310> to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
time factor obviously you don't have to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.219 
time factor obviously you don't have to
do<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:11.500> any<00:01:11.680> other<00:01:11.830> material<00:01:12.990> may<00:01:13.990> be<00:01:14.020> you

but<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.109> would<00:02:02.380> I'd<00:02:03.159> play<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:03.880> uh<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
but I would I'd play it uh as would be a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540 
but I would I'd play it uh as would be a
blind<00:02:11.050> let's<00:02:11.350> play<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.830> it'd<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:11.950> more<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
blind let's play but it'd be more of a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.590 
blind let's play but it'd be more of a
challenge<00:02:13.420> let's<00:02:13.810> play<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:15.190> get<00:02:15.340> two<00:02:15.640> aces<00:02:16.300> of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
challenge let's play to get two aces of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.020 
challenge let's play to get two aces of
how<00:02:17.140> many<00:02:17.200> aces<00:02:17.530> will<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.100> hold<00:02:18.370> at<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.819> end<00:02:18.970> of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
how many aces will I hold at the end of

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.740 
how many aces will I hold at the end of
my<00:02:19.120> let's<00:02:19.360> play<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.900> my<00:02:20.050> Beck<00:02:20.530> commander<00:02:20.980> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
my let's play for my Beck commander I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.510 
my let's play for my Beck commander I
would<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.640> don't<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.030> which<00:02:26.160> which<00:02:27.160> when<00:02:27.430> I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
would do I don't know which which when I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400 
would do I don't know which which when I
we<00:02:27.640> are<00:02:27.790> which<00:02:28.300> difficult<00:02:28.750> i<00:02:28.780> put<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.080> at<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
we are which difficult i put it at and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.710 
we are which difficult i put it at and
maybe

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.370 

I<00:02:31.980> probably<00:02:32.980> put<00:02:33.280> at<00:02:33.490> least<00:02:33.790> middle<00:02:34.360> normal<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
I probably put at least middle normal to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.770 
I probably put at least middle normal to
a<00:02:35.410> normal<00:02:36.100> higher<00:02:36.520> difficulty<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.570> like

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
a normal higher difficulty I think like

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.430 
a normal higher difficulty I think like
five<00:02:38.080> levels<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.710> game<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.330> with<00:02:40.750> be<00:02:41.020> greed

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440
