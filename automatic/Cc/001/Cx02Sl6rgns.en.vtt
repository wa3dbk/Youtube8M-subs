 from the television of united nations 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.410
 this is the un in action 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.430
 every second someone dies in the world 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 every two seconds ten children are born in 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 somewhere 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 increasing the global population to almost 7 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 billion people this year 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 in india is causing a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 displacement of people like rankig 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 Kumar Singh of 24 years of the villages 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.239
 rural areas to big cities like 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.610
 new delhi I came to delhi to be able 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.180
 earn money and give my children a new 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.180
 opportunity 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 Experts claim that within 20 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.960
 years india will replace china as the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 most populated nation on the planet 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 frank it was a farmer in bihar in the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.640
 northeast of india also known as 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.040
 the bread basket of the country 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.960
 his story is one of the more than 300 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.180
 millions of stories of people who 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.130
 they move to other places and they 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.880
 sacrifice in search of a better life 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.880
 for your children 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.770
 I did not want them to grow up and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.850
 become peasants like him 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.740
 when he made me a cameo in the village not 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.429
 we have many schools and they can not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429
 complete your education 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.900
 but the displacements of migrants 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.300
 as a ranking they are a burden on 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.890
 state resources that no longer give for 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.080
 plus 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.120
 in nothing is your fund representative 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.510
 of population of united nations in the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.700
 India the problem is that when 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.260
 mentions migration is taken for granted 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.260
 which is an urban problem 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.800
 but as more and more people are 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.320
 move to the city is also a problem 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.300
 for rural areas 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.370
 to keep up with the changes 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.320
 every decade the government of india 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.180
 carries out a census the largest in the world 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.550
 the basic objective is to review the past 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 evaluate the present and plan for the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.660
 future the general secretary and 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.450
 commissioner of censuses of india the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 chandra mul doctor and his we present 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.910
 an instant look across the country 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.950
 this year's census showed that india 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 has a surprising population of 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.959
 1.210 million people 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.909
 the census information motivated the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.400
 government to increase resources for 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.819
 social services and care 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.249
 Health 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.100
 this is good news for migrants 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.260
 as ranking 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.500
 but there in his village the conditions 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.170
 they are still terrible 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 as a faithful son ranking continues to help 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.030
 to your family with the daily expenses 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.159
 now he encourages some of his relatives 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.170
 to join him in new delhi where the 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.170
 demand for masons is high 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.960
 I'm bringing all of the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.630
 village so that they learn and they too 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.120
 teach your children 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.640
 frank aching the younger brother of run 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.390
 heat decided to follow his steps moving 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.390
 a new delhi 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.020
 but the capacity of the city of 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.510
 sustain the rapid change of the 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.540
 population will be the factor that determines 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.440
 if hashish run remains here or returns to 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.440
