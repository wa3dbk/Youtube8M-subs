vital that they fit together precisely
to<00:00:38.100> create<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.670> sound<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> sound<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.710> a

to create the right sound the sound of a
violin<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.550> created<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.360> hairs<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.870> the

violin is created when the hairs of the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.569 
violin is created when the hairs of the
bone<00:00:43.140> move<00:00:43.469> across<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.980> strings<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:45.300> this

the bridge it may look like it's just
the<00:01:01.440> structural<00:01:02.010> support<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.730> actually

the structural support but it's actually

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
the structural support but it's actually
very<00:01:03.149> important<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> sound<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
very important for the sound because it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.399 
very important for the sound because it
transmits<00:01:05.580> vibrations<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> strings<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
transmits vibrations from the strings to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
transmits vibrations from the strings to
the<00:01:07.439> upper<00:01:07.740> surface<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> violin<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> body

the upper surface of the violin the body
of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> violin<00:01:10.920> acts<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.729> an

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of the violin acts a bit like an

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.109 
of the violin acts a bit like an
amplifier<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.650> strings<00:01:13.979> vibrate<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.970> air

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
amplifier as the strings vibrate the air

inside<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> body<00:01:16.140> also<00:01:16.650> vibrates<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> makes

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
inside the body also vibrates and makes

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
inside the body also vibrates and makes
the<00:01:17.850> sound<00:01:18.119> audible<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> tension<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> the

the sound audible the tension of the

the sound audible the tension of the
strings<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.939> very<00:01:21.180> important<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.110> producing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
strings is very important for producing

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
strings is very important for producing
the<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:22.920> pitch<00:01:23.810> violinists<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.020> these

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the right pitch violinists use these

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.280 
the right pitch violinists use these
tuning<00:01:25.680> pegs<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.659> tighten<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
loosen the strings a tighter string will

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
loosen the strings a tighter string will
vibrate<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.770> quickly<00:01:32.100> resulting<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
vibrate more quickly resulting in a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.440 
vibrate more quickly resulting in a
sound<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> higher<00:01:33.960> pitch<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.790> strings<00:01:36.119> also

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
sound of a higher pitch the strings also

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.690 
sound of a higher pitch the strings also
have<00:01:36.810> different<00:01:37.200> thicknesses<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have different thicknesses so the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.490 
have different thicknesses so the
thickest<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.509> side<00:01:39.780> produces<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
thickest one on this side produces the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
thickest one on this side produces the
lowest<00:01:40.829> pitch<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.640> thinnest<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
lowest pitch and the thinnest one on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
lowest pitch and the thinnest one on
this<00:01:42.420> side<00:01:42.659> produces<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> highest<00:01:43.530> pitch<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
this side produces the highest pitch the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
this side produces the highest pitch the
frequency<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> vibrations<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:46.619> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
frequency of the vibrations can also be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
frequency of the vibrations can also be
changed<00:01:47.369> by<00:01:47.549> stopping<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.180> string<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
changed by stopping the string and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.530 
changed by stopping the string and
changing<00:01:49.290> its<00:01:49.409> length<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.299> create

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
changing its length you can create

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.960 
changing its length you can create
different<00:01:51.930> sounds<00:01:52.560> called<00:01:52.799> harmonics<00:01:53.399> by

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
different sounds called harmonics by

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
different sounds called harmonics by
lightly<00:01:54.299> stopping<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> string<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.590> certain

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
lightly stopping the string at certain

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.370 
lightly stopping the string at certain
intervals<00:01:56.369> along<00:01:57.090> its<00:01:57.270> length<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
intervals along its length the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
intervals along its length the
mathematical<00:01:59.070> ratio<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> these<00:01:59.759> intervals

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
mathematical ratio of these intervals

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.080 
mathematical ratio of these intervals
was<00:02:00.479> first<00:02:00.750> discovered<00:02:01.170> by<00:02:01.439> Pythagoras

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
was first discovered by Pythagoras

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.839 
was first discovered by Pythagoras
here's<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> sounds<00:02:03.630> like

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.729 

the<00:02:10.849> idea<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.900> keep<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.170> string<00:02:12.560> at

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
the idea is that you keep the string at

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.860 
the idea is that you keep the string at
virtually<00:02:13.189> the<00:02:13.219> same<00:02:13.340> tension<00:02:13.879> but<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.689> make

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
virtually the same tension but you make

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.780 
virtually the same tension but you make
it<00:02:15.049> shorter<00:02:15.530> resulting<00:02:16.129> in<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.310> high-pitched

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
it shorter resulting in a high-pitched

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.809 
it shorter resulting in a high-pitched
sound<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.560> vibrating<00:02:18.560> string<00:02:18.769> doesn't<00:02:19.489> just

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
sound a vibrating string doesn't just

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.569 
sound a vibrating string doesn't just
produce<00:02:19.969> one<00:02:20.450> single<00:02:20.750> frequency<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.799> actually

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
produce one single frequency is actually

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.550 
produce one single frequency is actually
simultaneously<00:02:23.170> vibrating<00:02:24.170> at<00:02:24.260> several

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
simultaneously vibrating at several

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.890 
simultaneously vibrating at several
different<00:02:24.640> frequencies<00:02:25.640> which<00:02:26.180> produces<00:02:26.599> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
different frequencies which produces the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.349 
different frequencies which produces the
