00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.120
 shirts are one of the pieces that 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.610
 they can not be missing in our closet and 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.770
 especially when spring arrives 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.199
 summer next I'll show you 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.199
 some outfits to combine 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.300
 the print on the shirts is one of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.000
 trends that currently carry 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 for this garment we can find 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.940
 with animal faces numbers letters and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.940
 as not phrases with some message 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.720
 the best option is to take it with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 high jeans that will favor your 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.360
 figure making you look taller and thinner 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.890
 and give a touch to your outfit with a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.890
 denim jacket 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.770
 as we have already said that the shirts 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.469
 with print prints of the type letters or 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.630
 numbers were trend I do not want 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.479
 forget about those that have 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.799
 images of cities and structures like 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.799
 esplanade of the eiffel tower 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 another way to combine them are with some 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.549
 smooth leggins with some small detail 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 in the knees that will give a touch 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.610
 informal and you will feel very comfortable 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.330
 the last option that I show you is in 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.970
 pastel shades with a little skirt 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 thug when combined with a hat and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.610
 can not miss a nice bag 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.739
