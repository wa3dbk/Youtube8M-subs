 shooting area 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.510
 I'll be frank with you first shooting 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.960
 were very heavy because we 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.729
 shot in brooklyn where kai lives 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.120
 in his one-room apartment where there is no 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.550
 air conditioner with a tiny staircase 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 playground even an elevator i suppose not 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.280
 worked in our team there were 15 people 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.620
 someone was working in the apartment itself someone 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.590
 outside everyone was exhausted from swearing 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 the terms of the people just could not stand from 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.299
 challenging work in such difficult conditions 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.030
 The shooting day was a long one 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.000
 somewhere around 5 in the morning even at 4:30 sometimes for 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.520
 the whole team don't know it was not very 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.890
 just during the filming process not not 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.140
 alternate shooting each other 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.440
 further and further the process went on 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.870
 rolled and became much easier we 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.880
 wanted to capture and convey all that he 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.990
 does everything that makes it up 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.660
 everyday life 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.320
 They wanted to make sure that everything is authentic and 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.960
 it really seems to me very cool that 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.650
 the scenery on the background of kai steel Brooklyn 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.760
 stone jungle and our 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.060
 gradual advancement through all 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.730
 city ​​madness is one of the best ideas 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.860
 which we have realized by the way this is what we 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.710
 spent the whole day with the underground metro and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.409
 visited different areas of Brooklyn KVN 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 winters are not and it was an idea to me on it 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.820
 there was a semblance of a mask and a hooded cape 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.379
 and we came to certain sites 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.980
 subway where there was something like 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:16.330
 decorated walls that passed 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.330
 film making process 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.069
 kai put on a mask and started his usual 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.349
 proper posing for him straight 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.329
 in the middle of the subway and unexpectedly 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.019
 a crowd of people formed despite 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.900
 rush hour 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.760
 crowds gathered around him and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.310
 complete, he removed the mask in front of everyone 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.220
 people and people recognized him this is kai green 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.739
 This is Kai Green and immediately understood who it is. 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.709
 was and there were people among all this crowd 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.159
 that came up to him and said kai 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.260
 green 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.540

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.549
 Olympia 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.349
 it was then I realized that perhaps 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.510
 bodybuilders began to dominate massively 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.069
 stars appeared among them 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.709
 distinguish among other athletes 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.510
 then I realized that the environment 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.689
 bodybuilders have powerful power 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.370
 impacts and influences and in these 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.769
 bodybuilders really have 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.470
 real followers and fans 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.650
 in the middle of the subway when no one expected it 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.549
 there see people noticed kaya and talked 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.840
