00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.270
 new technology builds your video this time 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.880
 it is about something quite banal namely 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.910
 ios 7 and i'm having a bad syndrome 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.370
 With ios 7 there have been some changes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 and now the apps are shooting up 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 me to and when closing you washed 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.100
 then go away and then I go to the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.560
 others should go all these movements 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 many people on the senkel and the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.769
 say moore then I can not do that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 Doing so often is almost like 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.090
 driving a car and reading some know that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
 so now we come to the reason 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 why it is important to make updates 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.860
 both devices started with ios 7 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.800
 here is the first update ios 7.0 point 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 2 on it and here already the 0 4 update 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.039
 and there were or there are in the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.469
 Settings the point of use guides 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.309
 there and there is the sub-point 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.539
 reduce movement so that makes a lot 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.090
 easier is also small again 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.550
 actually printed and now should 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
 or have that many thought that at the time 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.019
 was within the first month 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 now I have reduced that but far 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 you're still missing 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.580
 carousel and get everything here 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 possible for the ears hewn if you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.090
 now a new update makes then 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 Is this function changing? 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 no more but far from missing apple hears 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 then the round there on his 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.130
 Customer no do not increase contrast 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.689
 reduce movement we turn it in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.229
 the higher ios version 1 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.670
 then the following passes bosch and us 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.200
 have this normal again 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 disappears we do not have anymore 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 around here but haas a gentle 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.049
 transition but this is so here 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.579
 Tip for all the people I 've got 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.770
 again and again and therefore also 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 a video on the subject one makes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 update tried option and you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.310
 just does not bring the hoped-for effect 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.869
 many then despair and or bite 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 Stop in the sour apple and change 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.659
 has less with the apps just play 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.130
 less about or if you have an app 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.740
 States, I have already experienced the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.140
 Then just look away from your ios 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 you do not need your device if you have the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 have already tried attitude 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 Give her another chance so 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.099
 general operation so complete 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 Generally help with the operation 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.440
 somewhere they were here now 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.320
 because up there knicks help then movement 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.770
 reduce and turn on and then it is 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.120
 rest in the terrain and no I believe 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.790
 somebody measured that and that was 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.650
 somehow almost 100 km h or 80 km h with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 the speed with which then 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.820
 the apps open us to move away from you 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.470
 So that should be a whole 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.320
 his little explanatory videos 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.070
 Help grandma and grandpa aunt erika and whom 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.410
 always with a new ios device and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.790
 so that the less desperate and all 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.140
 which gives've tried it before 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.970
 the option is still a chance now 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.740
 the update will be easier thanks 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.400
 It looks good and to see 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.400
 next video
