00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 how to keep long mini 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.510
 flowering plants inside 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.020
 when we talk about houseplants this 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.370
 are plants sometimes that they get 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.320
 better outdoors to take 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.940
 the example of mini cyclamens mini 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.860
 cyclamens that sometimes support even 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.539
 temperatures below zero 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 degree so this is a plant that is 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.130
 ideal for putting inside a but 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.980
 especially placed well in the light but 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.360
 never in full sun so the interview 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.670
 cyclamen so that they continue to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.529
 to bloom it is necessary to monitor the base if 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.079
 you have some sick leaves 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.460
 wanted to withdraw as it is 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.130
 imperative 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.380
 if you have flowers that starts to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.450
 fade or started to rot especially 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.790
 never use a pair of scissors 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.989
 to cut them you have to turn the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.450
 flower then there are no flowers 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.760
 faded but now they have the principle on 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.710
 turn the flower on itself we pull a 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.600
 little snap and we got it up 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.910
 the end so that it does not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.870
 do not rot the bulb since 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.610
 talk bubble 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.530
 know that cyclamen do not like 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.469
 excess water and for that there is a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.790
 technical cd watered from below for that 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.399
 you will use 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.170
 why not a saucer saucer 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.580
 of planters here I even gathered 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.020
 several plants since the interview 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.440
 is virtually similar 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.940
 so we water from below unlike 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.590
 to what we could see in some 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.080
 case we ask you watered over 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.840
 but if you water on the pot you 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.850
 risk of rot the bulb is 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.860
 true also for the canoe the canoe that does not 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.200
 have no bulbs but who prefers 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.570
 have water from underneath we have 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.650
 also an eye is then the carnations this 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 are still outdoor plants 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.640
 but they still go inside 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.500
 and for that if you have flowers 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.600
 faded and well wanted to cut then there 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.830
 the difference of the cyclamen wanted to cut 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 with a pair of scissors 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.380
 unless you manage to detach them 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.570
 to return the buttons to 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.220
 the base if it is not very cold 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.950
 why not leave them a little bit of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.240
 gold creeks high and it's good 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.530
 autumn plants since it is a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.580
 plant two short days that is to say 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 that she will bloom 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.479
 when the nights are longer than 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.759
 the days now we're going 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.619
 to go to the fertilizer we will put them 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.390
 exactly the same fertilizer for these 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.890
 three plants there for that we will use 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.120
 an organic fertilizer a spoon and by 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.099
 liter of water so a tablespoon 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.930
 and for that there is a technique at 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.450
 place to put the water before we will put 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.810
 first the fertilizer the explanation is 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.810
 pretty simple it will allow for good 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.739
 mix this fertilizer their attention 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.569
 because organic fertilizers 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.000
 attach a little bit a little smell 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.480
 but it's not very bad and just 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 Well after we will put water 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.670
 inside so that it mixes well 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.769
 fertilizer the fertilizer is important for 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.269
 all and mine these mini planta he 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.069
 it's mini cannon cyclamen 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.019
 cauet yahoo or why not 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.280
 spathiphyllum during the period of 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.500
 blooming because that will allow them to 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.890
 that flowering lasts longer 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.410
 long time 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.470
 and this fertilizer you will wear it 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.690
 as for the water below but know 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.700
 one thing to water a plant to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.780
 the fertilizer it is always necessary that fashion 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.579
 be wet 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.340
 that's how we can hold very 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.590
 long mini flowering plants to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.250
 inside and outside when 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.250
 a little less cold
