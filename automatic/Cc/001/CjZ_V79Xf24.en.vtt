00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello kids this is psc gamers are 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.410
 inventions 29 is to see something also that I 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.440
 it has surprised good now you can not 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 see a lot 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.950
 but good 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.320
 now you will see to see if it arrived the active 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.030
 and very important for what I 'm going to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.130
 teach 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.130
 the mouse appears and there goes 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 I host many things but look and not 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 you are drugged you have not taken any 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.489
 drug but and this the truth sheet is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.489
 move 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.090
 the water also moves realistically up 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.090
 the leaves down here moves 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.200
 everything very realistic yes yes 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.659
 on the canvas he still has on his part 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.810
 he has what they call radios and dad 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.329
 look good 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.659
 you see the rays there they pass where the 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.450
 super well currado things 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.760
 you see up here all there was 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.040
 Y 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.320
 it's very good 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.410
 but Nestor spent with this knowledge 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 new ones that I have found that go very 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.710
 well very stable better than the previous 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 that many times they knew super lagazÃ³s and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 I followed a little better is not a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.660
 shit 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.790
 if you do not give a lot of these things and nothing 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.630
 they also taught you when it is day 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.630
 that now you are going to flip 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:01.670
 well, you start to see what 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.670
 first the shadows I already have a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.210
 it's not me this is what is cool 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.630
 is what spoke radios and say they are 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.620
 those failures there 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.170
 and the lens aberration that would be in 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.470
 this case what we are seeing here 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.500
 super well cured does and what he touches 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.840
 as you can see you are super in the currar 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.680
 Rays I loved a lot because 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.750
 It is true 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.050
 things you go through things 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.780
 and the shadows are very good that is 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.080
 it is very well worth it now well in the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.480
 technical part people of graphic card 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.900
 integrated do not try it especially if 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.350
 exists if it is another company to the best 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.080
 For example, portable, no accounts 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.440
 but intel you can not in any of your 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.210
 versions because it's going to exit error it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.320
 they will create minecraft yes even though they can play 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.900
 but thanks while you do not try and 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.760
 hala 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.700
 it is super well to work here you can see 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.930
 better than water 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.930
 2 of the operation 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.650
 It is very good 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.020
 look down to the water the effect this 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.020
 it's very good 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.450
 download link in the description as 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.700
 I will always also put the link of the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.769
 what is the name of the opd link and fan that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:51.870
 you need because it's a bit messy and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:54.629
 that I would take you and enjoy that the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.120
 1 400 will not last long either to see if the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.170
 uncle this keeps doing it 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.590
 the author is curiously called chocapic 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.590
 from this 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.950
 and I hope he keeps doing the venues 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.230
 for certain minecraft versions 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.500
 because I swear to you this guy is the success 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.380
 we must because it's underground flip 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.160
 I have already said it is going very well and that my 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.340
 summer is shit to fuck 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.550
 so they did not like to like it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.710
 favorites subscribe and see you the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.220
