two-tone seats the black and blue seats
there<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.840> fantastic<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> then

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
there look really fantastic and then

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
there look really fantastic and then
with<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> Wildcat<00:00:51.149> x<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.780> more

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
with the Wildcat x as you get more

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.979 
with the Wildcat x as you get more
horsepower<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> 1000<00:00:53.670> v-twin<00:00:54.090> h/o

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
horsepower so this is a 1000 v-twin h/o

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.310 
horsepower so this is a 1000 v-twin h/o
they<00:00:55.199> call<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> high<00:00:55.739> output<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.449> what

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
they call it high output and so what

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.360 
they call it high output and so what
they<00:00:58.469> did<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.949> still<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> same

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
they did it's still the same

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
they did it's still the same
displacement<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> regular<00:01:00.629> wildcats<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
displacement is the regular wildcats but

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.690 
displacement is the regular wildcats but
it<00:01:01.620> has<00:01:01.829> higher<00:01:02.340> compression<00:01:03.019> pistons<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
it has higher compression pistons and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.100 
it has higher compression pistons and
has<00:01:05.700> hotter<00:01:06.000> camps<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> may<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.840> some<00:01:06.990> other

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
has hotter camps it may have some other

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
has hotter camps it may have some other
stuff<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
stuff but that's what I know it has and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
stuff but that's what I know it has and
part<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> compression<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
part of how we know the compression is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.060 
part of how we know the compression is
higher<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.390> 91<00:01:12.390> octane<00:01:12.570> fuel<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> x<00:01:13.650> models

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
higher is 91 octane fuel on the x models

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
higher is 91 octane fuel on the x models
where<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> regular<00:01:14.790> wildcats<00:01:15.320> 87<00:01:16.320> octane<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
where the regular wildcats 87 octane is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.640 
where the regular wildcats 87 octane is
fine<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.880> starting<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.140> twenty

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
fine now starting with the twenty

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
change on these they all had the fox

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
change on these they all had the fox
podium<00:01:26.130> shocks<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.000> opposed<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> walker

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
podium shocks now as opposed to walker

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
podium shocks now as opposed to walker
evans<00:01:28.500> socks<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.220> walker<00:01:29.520> ever<00:01:29.759> socks

evans socks and the walker ever socks

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
evans socks and the walker ever socks
were<00:01:30.270> great<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.439> no<00:01:31.619> real<00:01:32.040> negative<00:01:32.220> to

were great there was no real negative to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
were great there was no real negative to
those<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.030> i<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.140> mostly<00:01:34.619> a

those at all i think this is mostly a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
those at all i think this is mostly a
vendor<00:01:35.280> change<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> fox<00:01:35.970> podium<00:01:36.390> shocks<00:01:36.689> also

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
vendor change the fox podium shocks also

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
vendor change the fox podium shocks also

when I ride these wild cats depending on

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.780 
when I ride these wild cats depending on
what<00:01:44.100> shocks<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.930> also<00:01:46.229> new<00:01:46.790> mid

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
what shocks they have this also new mid

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
what shocks they have this also new mid
year<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.240> 2013<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> wildcats<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> new

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
year for 2013 in the wildcats is the new

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
year for 2013 in the wildcats is the new
