possible<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.299> guess<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:13.930> might<00:04:14.260> be<00:04:14.319> time<00:04:14.620> based

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
possible I guess it might be time based

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.629 
possible I guess it might be time based
all<00:04:16.299> right<00:04:16.510> that's<00:04:16.720> okay<00:04:17.019> only<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.829> few<00:04:18.160> left<00:04:18.400> to
