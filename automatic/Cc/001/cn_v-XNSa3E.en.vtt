 Hello, how are you from YouTube? 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
 obligue jmee today I bring you a map 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.810
 called jiro bryant let's be what he does 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.970
 is that it allows you to previously 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 world of guadalajara the download link 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 in the description and if they do not know how 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.150
 integrate maps 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'm going to leave you a video that I made 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.090
 explaining how to install it and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 I recommend that what was there to prove it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.190
 because in creative it does not work so 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.190
 well it did not work well too 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 and to recite two gold blocks and two 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.630
 blocks of war and a planting 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 and also if you want you can put 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.360
 armor as you can see I have mature 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.880
 of diamond so they do not kill fast and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.910
 a sword 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.100
 to defend myself then the first thing that goes to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.640
 do is put the two blocks one 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 on top of the other 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.620
 put the other 2 up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 and after they put it what they have 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.260
 what to do is learn what is up and going to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.370

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.370

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.540
