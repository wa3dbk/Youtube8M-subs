00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.180
 a crisis a whole 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 when we decorate we usually focus on the rooms 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.489
 the kitchen 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.409
 and even the garden 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.279
 but let's leave aside these eternal forgotten in the corridors 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.079
 there are two fundamental legs when decorating a corridor 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.590
 of so much feeling of freedom if comfort to circulate more 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.140
 agile for our home 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.330
 we must eliminate the roadrunners that since they hardly have a source 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.820
 of natural light 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.510
 Following these two causes it is convenient that we choose neutral colors or pastels for 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 the walls 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.240
 these will give a feeling of greater amplitude since they reflect much better the 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.970
 light 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.210
 It is convenient to include some furniture in the corridors for those who went from 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.140
 there are more to less 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 they can be merely decorative mortals 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
 It was even figures that are very useful 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 as third parties 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 remaining 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 Shoemaker 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.750
 the carpets solve the paperwork of the corridors giving a feeling of 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 hospitality and kindness 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.490
 you can also place flowers plants four photographs trying to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.340
 that space does not have too much overloaded objects
