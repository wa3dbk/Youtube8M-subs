00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.940 

then<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> cover<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.739> with<00:00:37.739> saran

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
then I don't want to cover it with saran

then I don't want to cover it with saran
wrap<00:00:53.660> when<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> covered<00:00:55.320> you're

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.760 

let<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> cool<00:01:00.090> you're<00:01:00.870> aiming<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> get

let it cool you're aiming for it to get

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
let it cool you're aiming for it to get
around<00:01:01.890> 100<00:01:02.430> degrees<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.600> just

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
around 100 degrees which will be just

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
around 100 degrees which will be just
about<00:01:04.530> warm<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.159> fingers<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:05.909> hot

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
about warm on your fingers but not hot

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.380 
about warm on your fingers but not hot
at<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.869> our<00:01:07.830> water<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.119> our<00:01:09.150> yeast

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
at all our water for our yeast

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
at all our water for our yeast
rehydration<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.530> getting<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.640> about

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
rehydration is now getting just about

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
rehydration is now getting just about
blood<00:01:12.119> temperature<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> where<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.380> want

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
blood temperature which is where we want

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649 
blood temperature which is where we want
it<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.310> check<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> sterilized

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it you can check this with a sterilized

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660 
it you can check this with a sterilized
thermometer<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.680> sure<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.100> 100

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
thermometer to make sure it's around 100

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
thermometer to make sure it's around 100
degrees<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.409> lower<00:01:19.710> you're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
degrees if it's a little lower you're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.780 
degrees if it's a little lower you're
still<00:01:20.159> okay<00:01:22.189> now<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> right

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
still okay now that it's at the right

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
still okay now that it's at the right
temperature<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> add<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
temperature we're going to add in the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.039 
temperature we're going to add in the
yeast<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.360> nice

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
yeast so I'm going to take off the nice

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.510 
yeast so I'm going to take off the nice
saran<00:01:28.470> wrap<00:01:28.680> covering<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.130> has<00:01:29.340> been

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
saran wrap covering which has been

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
saran wrap covering which has been
keeping<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.880> nice<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.299> sterile<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:34.380> we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
keeping it nice and sterile then we're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.450 
keeping it nice and sterile then we're
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> cover<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.159> up

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.469 

now<00:01:40.120> I'm<00:01:40.420> going<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.659> take<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:41.020> sterilized<00:01:41.590> fork

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
now I'm going to take a sterilized fork

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.210 
now I'm going to take a sterilized fork
which<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.630> used<00:01:43.869> in<00:01:44.110> my<00:01:44.140> sanitization<00:01:44.890> fluid

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
which I used in my sanitization fluid

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.700 
which I used in my sanitization fluid
and<00:01:45.670> help<00:01:46.240> break<00:01:46.450> up<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.690> East<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.140> little<00:01:47.409> to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and help break up the East a little to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.580 
and help break up the East a little to
get<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> solution<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.140> don't<00:01:50.350> need<00:01:50.470> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
get it in a solution you don't need to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.140 
get it in a solution you don't need to
do<00:01:50.740> too<00:01:50.770> much<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.790> get<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.000> onto

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
do too much of this just to get it onto

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.800 
do too much of this just to get it onto
the<00:01:52.300> top<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.810> water<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.920> it'll<00:01:54.130> be<00:01:54.310> good

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the top of the water and it'll be good

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.960 
the top of the water and it'll be good
now<00:01:55.810> take<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:56.470> back<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.790> good

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
now take this back out get a good

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.270 
now take this back out get a good
covered<00:01:58.420> up<00:01:58.540> again<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.800> we're<00:01:59.950> going<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.130> put

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
covered up again and we're going to put

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.130 
covered up again and we're going to put
this<00:02:00.399> aside<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:01.030> our<00:02:01.420> room<00:02:01.659> temperature

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
this aside in our room temperature

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.560 
this aside in our room temperature
environment<00:02:02.649> for<00:02:03.310> about<00:02:03.460> 15<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.119> 30<00:02:04.390> minutes

environment for about 15 to 30 minutes

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.950 
environment for about 15 to 30 minutes
as<00:02:04.899> our<00:02:05.440> wort<00:02:05.649> cools
