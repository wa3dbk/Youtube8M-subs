00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 the most urbanized areas 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.610
 even once we were wrong if you put people off 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.130
 if i have ever gone fast trying to step it in the first 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 less profit in the quarter of 2010 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.309
 the room 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.720
 just like before the but the price of a barrel of brentolie sets the benchmark newspaper 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.339
 most 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.559
 if i wish the fam in the plan if you know it i still can't and may 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.550
 miss a walker on 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 and I can only get there 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 through the draw afp lpb through 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.680
 r 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.420
 both first position in the mission 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.650
 Darling and this time it will be best to definitely go for it 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 it's that everyone is fit to release a CD 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.520
 we now know she is not correct 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.039
 and the expensive yen 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.860
 so is the smartphone can make 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.190
 and a small part one is the safe in which this is legally required 7 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 looks like 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.710
 look and read a new share issue 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.890
 he thinks we respect him 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.960
 of which the elector at the press conference in dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.070
 per month 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
 why is it decided within a cross between a tram 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.010
 by the samsung store 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.980
 a video of boris 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.810
 and in scored 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.760
 and well the carriers in sindh 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.720
 how it then exactly is club Brugge before I recognize I have a lot 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 that is 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.590
 the suburbs 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 That's hard and smart living 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.070
 that is immediately again 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.050
 that thereby fall 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.050
 in March yes 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.870
 that makes the third appear 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 the process becomes 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 top 16 only once 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.040
 unfortunately come 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 or the buyer also noticeable 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.190
 we enter 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.269
 the trainer meant that 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.119
 the 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.899
 You are sitting there I have to blame 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.619
 there are 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.059
 I heard percent off 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.479
 the queen of pop to do on it 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.659
 stevens 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.429
 it is also readable 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:30.409
 I think 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.979
 they think 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 the strong club we already know the customer 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.840
 banker proven that you think the party jumpers 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.459
 the boy is a chair 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.500
 If it ever was energetic and racism services the end comes 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.309
 i think i can deteriorate at the price 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.659
 it makes sense 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.609
 this can add up 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.199
 Gorinchem 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.129
 the mugger 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.609
 hahaha
