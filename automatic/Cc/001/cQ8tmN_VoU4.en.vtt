like<00:01:23.550> most<00:01:23.700> guitars<00:01:23.970> most<00:01:24.570> guitars<00:01:24.750> are

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
like most guitars most guitars are

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
like most guitars most guitars are
rounded<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:27.150> flat<00:01:27.480> so<00:01:27.510> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
rounded in the back and it's flat so you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.860 
rounded in the back and it's flat so you
can<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.800> your<00:01:28.980> fingers<00:01:29.430> flat<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> and

to produce a sonic sound to it and it

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.320 
to produce a sonic sound to it and it
sounds<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:53.730> nice

the it has a five-set pickup all the way

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.720 
the it has a five-set pickup all the way
in<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.620> two<00:02:01.920> that's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
in the back it's just these two that's

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.370 
in the back it's just these two that's
making<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.150> vibrations<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:04.020> from<00:02:04.230> wherever

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
making the vibrations go from wherever

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.700 
making the vibrations go from wherever
the<00:02:04.590> note<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.950> making<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.940> go<00:02:06.060> farther<00:02:06.360> back

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the note is making it go farther back

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.099 
the note is making it go farther back
which<00:02:07.710> makes<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.249> sound<00:02:08.519> more<00:02:08.819> raw<00:02:09.359> for<00:02:09.959> like

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
which makes it sound more raw for like

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.240 
which makes it sound more raw for like

the<00:02:18.960> way<00:02:19.020> back<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> put<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.580> right<00:02:20.610> in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the way back if you put it right in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.210 
the way back if you put it right in
between<00:02:20.970> those<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:22.200> turning<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:22.950> these

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
between those you're turning on these

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
between those you're turning on these
two<00:02:23.580> which<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.420> kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.750> giving<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> more

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
two which is kind of giving you a more

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.490 
two which is kind of giving you a more
alternative<00:02:26.130> rock<00:02:26.490> sound<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.750> too<00:02:28.020> heavy<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
alternative rock sound not too heavy and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.710 
alternative rock sound not too heavy and
not<00:02:28.680> too<00:02:28.800> normal<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
not too normal but if you have it in the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.890 
not too normal but if you have it in the
middle<00:02:31.190> only<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.490> one's<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.300> it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
middle only this one's going and it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.630 
middle only this one's going and it's
kind<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.440> where<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> middle<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
kind of like where the middle of the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400 
kind of like where the middle of the
sound<00:02:35.910> hole<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.170> kind<00:02:37.350> of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
sound hole would be so it's kind of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
sound hole would be so it's kind of
giving<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.740> guitar<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> natural<00:02:38.520> sound<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
giving the guitar a natural sound if you

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.050 
giving the guitar a natural sound if you
have<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.320> between<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> way

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
have it in between that and all the way

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760 
have it in between that and all the way
in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.270> beginning<00:02:42.390> you're<00:02:43.260> trying<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.620> these

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
in the beginning you're trying on these

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.860 
in the beginning you're trying on these
two<00:02:44.130> which<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.240> going<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
two which is kind of like going just

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
two which is kind of like going just
these<00:02:45.990> two<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.560> you're<00:02:47.160> getting<00:02:47.459> closer<00:02:47.700> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
these two but you're getting closer to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.570 
these two but you're getting closer to
the<00:02:48.690> beginning<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.280> one

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the beginning which is this this one

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.570 
the beginning which is this this one
which<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.120> giving<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.780> warm<00:02:52.580> sound

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
which is giving it a more warm sound

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
which is giving it a more warm sound
like<00:02:54.090> jazz<00:02:54.540> stuff<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> guitar

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
like jazz stuff like that so the guitar

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.740 
like jazz stuff like that so the guitar
sounds<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.230> nice<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.740> has<00:02:58.920> two<00:02:59.220> knobs

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
sounds really nice it has two knobs

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.550 
sounds really nice it has two knobs
volume<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.770> has<00:03:01.980> tone<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.260> whammy<00:03:04.530> bar

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
volume and it has tone the whammy bar

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.030 
volume and it has tone the whammy bar
comes<00:03:05.100> out<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.740> you<00:03:07.740> can<00:03:07.890> easily

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
comes out like that you can easily

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.980 
comes out like that you can easily
probably<00:03:08.520> can't<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> saw<00:03:09.630> box

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
probably can't see it in the saw box

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.500 
probably can't see it in the saw box
there's<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.890> little<00:03:11.130> spot<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.390> can

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
there's a little spot when you can

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.310 
there's a little spot when you can
usually<00:03:12.930> put<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
usually put it right back in and as you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.790 
usually put it right back in and as you
can<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.860> floyd<00:03:17.160> rose<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:19.170> comes<00:03:19.590> up

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
can see on the floyd rose it comes up

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.190 
can see on the floyd rose it comes up
and<00:03:20.340> goes<00:03:20.519> down<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.300> even<00:03:21.510> pull<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.780> up<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and goes down you can even pull it up to

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.600 
and goes down you can even pull it up to
make<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.560> down<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.709> super<00:03:26.190> slinky

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
make it go down and I have super slinky

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.890 
make it go down and I have super slinky
strings<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.150> here<00:03:27.360> because<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> do<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.720> lot<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
strings on here because I do a lot of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.340 
strings on here because I do a lot of
bending<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:29.100> harmonics<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.360> ezio<00:03:30.840> stuff<00:03:31.200> like

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
bending in harmonics up ezio stuff like

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.580 
bending in harmonics up ezio stuff like
that<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.090> guitar<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.600> all<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:34.019> really
