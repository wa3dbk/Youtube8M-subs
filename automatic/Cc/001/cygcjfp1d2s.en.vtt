well<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> tree

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
well it's the same thing about a tree

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.880 
well it's the same thing about a tree
you<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> painting<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.710> a

you when you do a painting and you put a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.270 
you when you do a painting and you put a
tree<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.850> looks<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.870> in

for

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.010 

I'll<00:03:39.850> get<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.180> right<00:03:40.330> yet<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:42.209> there<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.720> two

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
I'll get it right yet and there is a two

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:53.070 
I'll get it right yet and there is a two
point<00:03:44.440> perspective<00:03:45.420> shed<00:03:46.620> yes<00:03:47.620> ma'am

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.330 

yeah<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.070> ridgeline<00:03:54.550> from<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.910> top<00:03:56.190> peak<00:03:57.190> of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
yeah the ridgeline from the top peak of

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.190 
yeah the ridgeline from the top peak of
the<00:03:57.430> roof<00:03:57.610> that<00:03:58.360> goes<00:03:58.600> back<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.900> this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
the roof that goes back to this

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.760 
the roof that goes back to this
vanishing<00:03:59.710> point<00:03:59.920> also<00:04:00.540> okay<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.170> when<00:04:02.620> it

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
vanishing point also okay so when it

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.450 
vanishing point also okay so when it
comes<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.310> doing<00:04:03.520> an<00:04:03.730> old<00:04:03.910> shed<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
comes to doing an old shed you have to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.240 
comes to doing an old shed you have to
be<00:04:06.610> aware<00:04:06.880> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.240> principles<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:08.050> two<00:04:08.920> point

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
be aware of the principles of two point

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.780 
be aware of the principles of two point
perspective<00:04:09.720> okay<00:04:10.720> now<00:04:11.340> what<00:04:12.340> I'm<00:04:12.490> going<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
perspective okay now what I'm going to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.110 
perspective okay now what I'm going to
do<00:04:13.000> now<00:04:13.240> is<00:04:13.570> with<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.830> awareness<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.820> two

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
do now is with this awareness of two

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.600 
do now is with this awareness of two
point<00:04:16.450> perspective<00:04:17.400> okay<00:04:18.430> now<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:24.280> come<00:04:24.580> up

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
point perspective okay now you come up

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.810 
point perspective okay now you come up
to<00:04:24.790> an<00:04:25.120> old<00:04:25.300> barn<00:04:25.770> all<00:04:26.770> right<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.250> want<00:04:27.520> that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
to an old barn all right you want that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.500 
to an old barn all right you want that
old<00:04:27.850> barn<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:30.040> sitting<00:04:30.490> kind<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.940> up<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:31.240> this

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
old barn it's sitting kind of up on this

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.010 
old barn it's sitting kind of up on this
let's<00:04:32.320> put<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.550> on<00:04:33.760> an<00:04:34.540> incline

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
let's put a kind of on it on an incline

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.760 
let's put a kind of on it on an incline
like<00:04:35.260> this

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
like this

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
like this
here's<00:04:36.340> an<00:04:36.760> old<00:04:36.940> barn<00:04:37.420> okay<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.590> it's<00:04:39.340> kind<00:04:39.640> of

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
here's an old barn okay and it's kind of

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.840 
here's an old barn okay and it's kind of
sagging<00:04:40.060> there's<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.440> front<00:04:41.770> corner<00:04:42.010> it's

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
sagging there's that front corner it's

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:52.040 
sagging there's that front corner it's
leaning<00:04:43.740> okay

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.510 

so<00:04:53.250> instead<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.310> perfectly<00:04:54.910> vertical<00:04:55.360> lines

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.950 

now<00:05:00.520> X<00:05:00.970> from<00:05:01.330> corner<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.750> corner

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.770 

now<00:05:08.470> something<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.460> really<00:05:10.180> interesting

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
now something that is really interesting

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.020 
now something that is really interesting
about<00:05:10.900> old<00:05:11.380> barns<00:05:11.949> to<00:05:12.190> make<00:05:12.400> them<00:05:12.580> look<00:05:12.820> a

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
about old barns to make them look a

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.260 
about old barns to make them look a
little<00:05:13.300> bit<00:05:13.509> more<00:05:13.750> interesting<00:05:14.639> put<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.669> SAG<00:05:16.060> in

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
little bit more interesting put a SAG in

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.800 
little bit more interesting put a SAG in
the<00:05:16.389> roof<00:05:19.169> okay<00:05:20.370> all<00:05:21.370> right<00:05:21.460> we<00:05:22.060> put<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.300> SAG<00:05:22.630> in

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
the roof okay all right we put a SAG in

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.040 
the roof okay all right we put a SAG in
the<00:05:22.930> roof<00:05:23.370> all<00:05:24.370> right<00:05:24.550> now<00:05:25.120> if<00:05:25.449> you<00:05:25.690> want<00:05:25.900> to

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
the roof all right now if you want to

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.920 
the roof all right now if you want to
put<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.259> lean-to<00:05:26.949> there's<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.120> lean-to<00:05:28.330> going

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
put a lean-to there's the lean-to going

perspective<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:36.410> increase<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.400> visual

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
perspective to increase the visual
