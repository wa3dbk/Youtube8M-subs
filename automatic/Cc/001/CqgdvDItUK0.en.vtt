00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
quite pathetic huh you would think that

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.530 
quite pathetic huh you would think that
the<00:06:29.930> ma'am<00:06:30.110> Hydra<00:06:30.590> is<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.100> best<00:06:31.310> but<00:06:31.820> it's<00:06:31.940> not

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.960 

it<00:06:35.540> is<00:06:36.140> not<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.380> best<00:06:36.620> because<00:06:37.220> it's<00:06:37.580> only<00:06:37.700> one

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
it is not the best because it's only one

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.570 
it is not the best because it's only one
hand<00:06:38.330> instead<00:06:39.200> of<00:06:39.320> three<00:06:39.680> so<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.190> damage<00:06:40.340> on

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
hand instead of three so the damage on

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.240 
hand instead of three so the damage on
it<00:06:40.700> is<00:06:40.820> literally<00:06:41.270> 22<00:06:41.870> percent<00:06:42.230> okay

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
it is literally 22 percent okay

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.090 
it is literally 22 percent okay
while<00:06:43.640> all<00:06:44.180> the<00:06:44.330> other<00:06:44.510> ones<00:06:44.900> like<00:06:45.590> the

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
while all the other ones like the

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.160 
while all the other ones like the
Lightning<00:06:46.370> Hydra<00:06:46.640> even<00:06:47.090> those<00:06:47.210> 34<00:06:47.780> percent

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
Lightning Hydra even those 34 percent

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.370 
Lightning Hydra even those 34 percent
there's<00:06:48.950> three<00:06:49.310> of<00:06:49.340> them

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
there's three of them

00:06:50.380 --> 00:07:05.820 
there's three of them
duh

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.170 

so<00:07:06.830> the<00:07:06.920> madman<00:07:07.190> hacker<00:07:07.310> is<00:07:07.580> really<00:07:08.060> the

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
so the madman hacker is really the

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.330 
so the madman hacker is really the
weakest<00:07:08.570> one<00:07:08.750> in<00:07:09.200> all<00:07:09.440> the<00:07:09.560> hi<00:07:09.680> dress<00:07:09.920> which<00:07:10.220> is

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 
very sad so yeah that's the skill for

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.850 
very sad so yeah that's the skill for
the<00:07:14.980> Hydra<00:07:16.540> so<00:07:17.540> when<00:07:17.720> we<00:07:17.840> get<00:07:17.960> back<00:07:18.020> we<00:07:18.560> will<00:07:18.770> be

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
the Hydra so when we get back we will be

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.190 
the Hydra so when we get back we will be
looking<00:07:19.160> at<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.640> all<00:07:19.790> famous<00:07:20.300> a<00:07:20.450> meteors<00:07:21.350> you
