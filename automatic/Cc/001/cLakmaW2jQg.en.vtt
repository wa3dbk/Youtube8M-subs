00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 you and I will need barley milk 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 cereal a little butter and dried apricots dried apricots 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.780
 and pre- cut here on such 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.429
 small cubes if you don’t like q 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
 work and and in principle can be replaced 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120
 any dried fruit but if it is for you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 like that i advise you to start all the same 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.380
 from her because with dried apricots 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 taste is obtained taste of this card 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 it turns out just unforgettable and how are you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.570
 understood to cook we will be in my 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 favorite multicooker 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 I ply for the night in order in the morning 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.730
 no longer bother here in the kitchen but already 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 come here and wake up dead and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 eat a pap immediately 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 so let's start open the lid and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.329
 here inside we lay with you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 First I have butter 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 a little piece and a little bit 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.140
 we melt that is click on 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.329
 the button does not close the heated cover 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 just wait until the butter is slightly there 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.250
 it melts and so the butter is melted 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.760
 a little and we pour barley 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 cereal 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 right on one bowl of the multicooker 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 here it covers slightly 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.909
 I don't need much 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.860
 I don't cook because my daughter doesn't much 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 eats well and I do n’t actually 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.200
 a lot of need and fill the whole thing 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 my milk is almost like 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.670
 is always 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 do not fill the village milk 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 afraid to fill a lot to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 porridge was liquid well, because for example 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 My daughter loves when porridge is liquid in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.390
 Generally, I also tend to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 liquid porridge but almost all 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.960
 now I distribute slightly like this 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.909
 there is this whole thing inside in milk and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.340
 I fall asleep dried apricots just take 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 from above and so here I just try but 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 more evenly somehow the whole thing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 I do not use sugar to fall asleep 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.350
 because like no more like instead 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.350
 sugar used dried apricots 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.020
 In principle, you can salt this gruel 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.530
 but I don’t salt I don’t like salt for some reason 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.659
 porridge 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.229
 But in general, that is now all close 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.000
 cover and now you and I need to choose 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.570
 mode I choose milk porridge mode 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.310
 I click on the menu button and here 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.500
 me milk porridge mode here by 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.800
 the default is 25 minutes I sometimes put 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.820
 on 25 sometimes I put on 30 but in principle 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.100
 25 minutes is actually enough after 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100
 this what we do now I have 11 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.920
 o'clock in the evening and I put a reprieve button 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.320
 time when i should have and takasi 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 prepare that is for example me 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.989
 it is necessary that porridge was ready at 9 if 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.209
 it is now 11 pm I put a reprieve on 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.430
 10 hours now we will choose with you 8 9 10 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.070
 that is, in 10 hours the porridge will be ready 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.650
 and press the start button and now i'm 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.950
 I'm going to bed, and in the morning I'll take you off 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.320
 porridge ready and so good morning to all 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.800
 that's what we get we press the button 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.590
 cancellations 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.739
 and right there inside me to what's there now 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.690
 inside now let me have you already or on 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.209
 plate and you take a closer look at it 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.209
 and here is such a gimmick I got luminaries not 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.010
 very fluid milk Although there were many that 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.230
 There is such a consistency usually 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.209
 it turns out I really like his taste 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.560
 amazing due to the fact that there is not 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.200
 sugar is dried apricots 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.540
 gives both sweetness and such sourness 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.430
 small well, in general, what a terrific porridge 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.850
 in my opinion so try 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.890
 try and branches is very useful then 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.709
 I have a daughter I love and I myself 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.390
 also sometimes attached to her x here 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.950
 so yes thank you all for your attention and 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.950
 bon appetit and bye
