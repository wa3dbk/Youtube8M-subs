00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.860
 good to all welcome to a new 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.660
 good white video these days news 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.880
 without even having left you already know 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 that a few days ago the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.630
 name of white that all and good is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.960
 suppose it's going to be the next game 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.279
 of activision and good professionally 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.169
 we're going to call it black ops all with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.779
 that name and we'll see to see how it 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:25.259
 call but good already that and the analysts 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 they speculate with the title and they make a 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.909
 versus against modern warfare 3 does not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.060
 asks the following question 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:35.969
 you think that black ops 2 will overcome in 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.340
 the sale of modern warfare 3 and good are 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.519
 they ask that question and they remain 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.600
 basically that yes it will overcome the 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.550
 sales yo 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.230
 that is to say good dishes also to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.370
 you ask that question if you think that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 take everything to sell more than modern 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.570
 warfare 3 you already know that all 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.030
 titles that is the call of duty and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.399
 they sell more than the previous image more 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.019
 where most are going to have to stop 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.519
 by balls is to that growth by 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.820
 eggs people are going to get fed up with what 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.159
 better that there is not a big change to 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 people like that formula but the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.210
 people are getting tired too, I am what 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.950
 what I think about people is going to start 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.869
 to tire of them too I hope 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.509
 that there is a change at least in the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.289
 next generation if you are not and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.289
 good 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 black ops 1 disappointed enough 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 people and that's why I doubt that black ops 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.229
 2 could sell 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.120
 more than modern warfare 3 since also 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.280
 modern warfare 3 have disappointed many 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.870
 people in general to take it out turia 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 defrauded several people that what 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.210
 we said in a video yesterday that he has 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.460
 defrauded the people that battlefield 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.619
 3 to those who waited or after another 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.619
 chapter saga battlefield and good 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.450
 regarding black ops 2 will surpass 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.909
 burgos after three minutes is to say that it is 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 very soon to say it is very very very 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.549
 soon 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.769
 activision and treyarch infinity ward 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.340
 they always have the trailers up their sleeve 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 those trailers that take and cheat us 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.690
 many times we think that it will be 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.420
 this seems to be total it seems that this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.860
 which and then really not then this 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 which is bullshit this is another 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.180
 shit and the trailer has been very handsome 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.610
 and cheats us all as assholes 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 happens with many games I tell you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.549
 very seriously to go through a lot 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.650
 games that we see the trailer notify 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.910
 of the best ingame and such we see that 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.260
 the gameplay is crap that what 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.430
 graphic is crap and that the trailer 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.370
 It was an authentic, well-made hoax 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 I think braves two yes that will come 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.470
 to overcome modern warfare 3 but 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.590
 but of course not, but if 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.659
 they do badly if they really do badly I 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 I think that is going to be the last title 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.159
 in which sales are already exceeded and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.019
 next, no matter how well they do it already 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.909
 no longer going to have more sales than 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.430
 the previous one let's go I 'm not more understood 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.079
 if black ops 2 the shit again good 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.180
 white monkey plus will have more sales 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.400
 that modern warfare 3 most likely is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.470
 something that keeps growing is something that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.000
 is booming that no tuti is a brand 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.510
 that sells only by name to either 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.930
 nike be it well-known brands that 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.370
 life me I know the samsung sony microsoft 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.079
 does not matter 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.740
 carlotto that is already like a brand is not 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.470
 as a gentleman 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.910
 that already sells by itself I think to speak 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.970
 with the two will overcome while the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.060
 love warfare 3 but there is that but the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.550
 I was saying if they do it wrong I 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.460
 I think that's going to be the end of the in 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.620
 crescendo of carlotto that is going to be the 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.300
 final and it's going to be the last thing they do 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.300
 to win people not 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.330
 Yes, really 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.370
 activision 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.160
 want to keep the call mark 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.160
 of duty I do not think that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.590
 and keep doing what you are doing 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.720
 maybe it makes you a little bit to listen 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.790
 to the players who are the ones who 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.430
 they are really sent to you 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.269
 to follow them always and not to the best 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.530
 the novices who only know how to use the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.260
 things like that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.750
 to save said the Paraguayans who 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.550
 they are in a corner that are in all 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.110
 the game that has fun playing and that 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.610
 they only play a month to the game and then what 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.010
 leave you can have it who was the game 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.130
 not invented with some players is in 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.139
 a corner playing basically those that 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.570
 we really feed them activision 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.889
 we are the ones who stay there playing and 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.919
 playing and playing trying to improve 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.080
 trying such trying I do not know what but 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.240
 we can not basically for the things of 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.850
 packages that put useless advantages to 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.689
 dragons of useless deaths things 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.519
 imbeciles 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:03.659
 and to talk to all this does not change 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:06.860
 I think being in total garlic and I do not know what 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.900
 you think I do not know if thinking is that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.340
 blackrock 2 will come more like golf 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.650
 3 the truth is that what I have 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.330
 said to say yes it will sell more already 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.610
 I know it's hard to think and believe 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.889
 I also have my doubts about the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.469
 same but well there I left it there what 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.940
 dropped said that he will sell more and not 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.760
 I know if it will sell more 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.440
 and I do not say that it will be better eye than anyone 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.280
 he began to say nonsense that I said 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.140
 that it will be better I do not know if it will be better 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.820
 but I do know that it will come more is something 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.770
 that is growing and growing in 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.340
 growing and growing and does not stop 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.900
 grow up so good this has been all 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.910
 what interests me all desserts 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.620
 opinions that you put in the comments 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.240
 if you think they are going to sell more 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.139
 regardless of whether I'm going to be good or bad 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.330
 the game if you think you 're going to sell more 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.860
 what I have said there are many people who 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.349
 he does not even like the game 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.210
 treyarch although well especially in the 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.909
 5 tutti broth left me a good taste of 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.550
 mouth but black ops maybe not because I 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.529
 I am expecting something more like equal heat 25 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.920
 that modern warfare 2 I expected something 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.290
 more like modern warfare 1 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.870
 on the stand he also has part of 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.610
 I really still buy the wines you 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.310
 you say because I want to see a call of duty 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.230
 as channel 24 is a call of duty as 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.630
 the call 25 but good every year I get 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.370
 a kick in the balls more and good 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.020
 basically now how am I on youtube 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.420
 Well, I'm going to keep buying the call of 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.150
 duty basically to teach them to 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.800
 decide what I think and such but 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.580
 good also for that thorn that I have 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.110
 in the heart not that is basically 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.810
 I want a call of duty 4 and I want 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.630
 I have all 25 games but I want 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.030
 that they take out 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.660
 the game that we say looks like the 44 and 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:53.680
 charge 5 and it's simple but very good 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.710
 no nonsense without normality and good 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.730
 tabárez 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.880
 recommended seems the news until the 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.880
 next
