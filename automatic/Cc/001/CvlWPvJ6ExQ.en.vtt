00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi to all these rogues I hope that 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 you're fine we end up for a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.740
 new video on mario kart is so 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.090
 spent the first episode of ghost 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 challenge ten minutes chrono 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 this is the inauguration of an already I 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.519
 wanted to thank you for your 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.809
 comments about my project 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 really your support etc 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.180
 it made me happy and suddenly my I 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.199
 already received a ghost 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.490
 not that we will discover immediately 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.080
 which is already going I want to thank 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.710
 the candidate who took the first step 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.890
 it's always fun so direction 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 mario kart chain 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.110
 so I have everything prepared a g the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630
 stopwatch to be sure not to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.649
 exceed 10 minutes 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:44.129
 my ghosts clip download one will 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.989
 discover immediately who knows no 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.610
 here is gun seven on moonlight road 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.730
 on the moonlight road it's a map 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 that I had worked that I had worked at 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.989
 the time but it's not a map where 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 I excel is really so it'll do 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.129
 a little scared anyway because that's 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 it's not an obvious map with 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 cars etc 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 so in fact chi kong and bÃ©can bowser 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
 so that's fine since it's the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.159
 fight also that I will take so 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 this map it is feasible on torpedo 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.820
 but I do not control it at all 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.830
 with this vehicle 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 so here I have unlocked funky kong to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 the moment we will take it 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 manual bike and we left so good 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 luck guen seven and I will activate 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 the timer right away to be 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 sure not to exceed 10 minutes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.860
 so if I go over on a small 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.159
 ringtone that will mean that I lost 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.159
 here we go 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 already I take a better start but 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.980
 okay so we do not have the same 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 strategy 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:51.900
 melchiot in the first round what I 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.620
 do not do good then I'm just 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.990
 behind him 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.920
 whatever I lose sight of good I you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.300
 warnings then surely bail 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.010
 leaves the little stuff like that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.180
 since I'm not going to do something 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.850
 perfect is especially beat the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.850
 ghosts that's the real goal 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.030
 so it seems recurring it will finish 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.470
 a hair in front of me so here I go 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.570
 activate the mushroom here it makes me 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 so we do not really have the same 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.050
 strategy 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.360
 I missed my mt it was not good 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 oulala 1 I was hot it is scary 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.740
 like this yellow gold car so it is 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.510
 behind me then I tell you nothing nothing 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.980
 is not won because this map I them 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.690
 cars that's it can ruin everything 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.470
 here I am Thursday and here it happens to me 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.660
 no i do not think i can 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.570
 make up for it knowing that I have ten 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.280
 minutes I will not take the risk of 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.440
 to continue knowing that I'm not sure 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.790
 to be able to beat him 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 so here am I can tell you go there 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.080
 surely have to start again then that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.090
 happens to everyone make queues 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.120
 we do not dare say but we really do 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 balance sheets and read 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.860
 so I took the start himself 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.860
 that better 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.290
 here I prefer to be enough distance 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 like that i know i'm not too much at 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.560
 the fluff 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.019
 a very laborious beginning 1 if I see that 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:25.799
 I do not regain ground I think 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:29.370
 I will start again okay 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.849
 again I have 7 minutes left 58 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.170
 seconds 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.760
 what pressures it's true that in ten 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.720
 minutes 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.280
 if we want to do something really too 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.299
 good of one if it's not enough you 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.680
 to do a very very good thing so 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.030
 really have a safety margin 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.150
 that's what I'm going to do from 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.150
 now 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.840
 so here I am in front is not bad 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 he caught me 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:14.440
 ok the error what an error we inspire in 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.320
 expiring focuses because behind 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.739
 ten minutes it goes pretty fast especially 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.739
 in summer 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.539
 here is in risk risk the years granted 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.159
 the one where concentration what's this 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.990
 say you are a little bit close 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.830
 what especially that I speak a little 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.830
 little so it's not easy 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.510
 good I finished this first round in front 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:59.790
 with almost 2 tenths of advanced so 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.290
 passage a little tricky here you have 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.940
 heard the controller had not happened 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:10.260
 but I mismanaged this passage I 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.280
 still some lead there I do 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.720
 truck blunder and ultimate it's a 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:26.010
 ultimate sign 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:30.350
 olala or to me he does not let me loose 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.350
 it's not going to be very tight 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.160
 a page I know by cons that 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.840
 a lot of cars so I have to 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.840
 take again here I did well I 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.880
 well anticipated I will keep my field 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.270
 udder nothing now use it 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.760
 I happen 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.990
 well if I do a little bit and I 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.760
 can catch up with this jobsite it's 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.310
 reassuring 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.420
 navail have truck yeah yeah I have not 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.590
 I have not lost everything yet 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:02.290
 there too where is so normally if I 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:08.860
 do not do anything I finish in one 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:12.640
 47 193 and so I'm in times it 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.710
