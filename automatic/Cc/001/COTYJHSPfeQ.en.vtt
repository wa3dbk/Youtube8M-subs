00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 good afternoon with you channel touch it 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.919
 permanent lead Sergei today on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.280
 iPhone example 5 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.519
 I will show you how to glue films and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.330
 so we need we need 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 film see picking when 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 rather meager I chose the military 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.699
 plenochka here on the two sides will glue 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.109
 one here you look usual plenochka 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.859
 Usually rags beautifully but you hardly 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 will need 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 he actually leave grains of sand 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.969
 made of very poor fiber 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.570
 qualities we take 3 check 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.300
 such a plan is a good microfiber 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 little white one or take the standard 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 blue cloth 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 generally a little bit of excellent quality 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 used also we need here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.230
 Such a thing is called 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.040
 type mask under diva plenochku and removes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.640
 unnecessary mud points and accordingly 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.600
 cardboard such cardboard smoothing 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 the surface will also need it 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 Further, the first thing we do 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.430
 this is usually the usual spray 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 glass cleaners cover 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 Someone can cover it with alcohol. 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.770
 not very important to remove the film with 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.350
 iPhones 100 principle is very important and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.869
 we begin to smooth this whole thing 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.540
 smooth perfectly so there is no 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:46.729
 extra points to avoid divorces 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.790
 you need to rub absolutely perfect 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.079
 because then when sticking film 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.869
 there will be such small bubbles 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.750
 which will be very annoying 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:01.490
 the surface must be perfect it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 can only be checked in the light 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.610
 like we coped with this task 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.420
 put on 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.580
 iphone button 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.450
 from itself, that is, the button should be 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.190
 upstairs just so comfortable who is like a lord 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.010
 in fact I prefer it that way 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.160
 there are two layers here as in all 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.400
 we wipe the hole with a tape 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.940
 here they are 1 2 and for him we will 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.069
 to operate 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.920
 and so remove the top layer neatly 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.989
 does not touch the film itself and look and 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 start reconcile first 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:51.700
 a button so that it fits perfectly with us 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.810
 perfect on no bed you look there 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:02.190
 there is already a surface problem for this 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.190
 we take a sticker here is such a thing and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.910
 remove the whole point and look like everything 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:17.410
 perfect again take 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:20.620
 this plenochka and already here so 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.859
 start this whole thing to do on a button 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.849
 and by dynamics it is very important because 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.349
 have to be cut must match 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:36.419
 please put everything matched 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:40.389
 plenochka itself smoothed to be honest 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:44.760
 it's even too easy to start. 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:49.510
 smooth out so that the riverman of jambs was not 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.919
 iphone 5 behaves quite well 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.280
 starting to smooth 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:56.260
 that there was not even the slightest points well 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.319
 please begin to remove the second layer 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:06.269
 here it is neatly over shoot to 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.269
 the first layer did not start to peel off 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.760
 So please, we have a ready iphone in 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.980
 In general, in principle, nothing was needed 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.380
 do so special want it 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.989
 wipe off 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.579
 want to kiss him, and I do not know can 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.710
 principle do anything with it 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.220
 Plenochka already pasted surface already 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:36.509
 protected look carefully let's 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.509
 I'll show you in general, we did it with a bang 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.699
 you can also use this 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.220
 little thing if suddenly the air does not go out 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.320
 specially smoothed it more 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:54.070
 solid and allows air to escape through 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.400
 edges and so with you was the channel touch me
