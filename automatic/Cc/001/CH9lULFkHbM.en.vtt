windbreaker<00:00:08.639> it's<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.570> piece<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.990> tape

windbreaker it's just a piece of tape
over<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.679> microphone<00:00:11.509> I'm<00:00:12.509> guessing<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.960> I

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
over the microphone I'm guessing that I

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.630 
over the microphone I'm guessing that I
got<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.000> over<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> microphone<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.640> really

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
got it over the microphone it's a really

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300 
got it over the microphone it's a really
small<00:00:18.000> hole<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.600> believe<00:00:18.990> that's<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.410> try<00:00:20.250> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
small hole I believe that's it try it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:44.180 
small hole I believe that's it try it
again<00:00:20.460> here

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.970 

going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> quick<00:00:45.329> trip<00:00:45.359> here<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.859> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
going to be a quick trip here just to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:56.150 
going to be a quick trip here just to
see<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> window

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.080 

okay<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.510> guess<00:01:58.990> we'll<00:01:59.550> have<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.760> go<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:00.970> and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
okay so I guess we'll have to go in and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.090 
okay so I guess we'll have to go in and
try<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.750> what<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:01.990> sounds<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:03.040> if

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
try this see what it sounds like see if

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.980 
try this see what it sounds like see if
it's<00:02:03.220> any<00:02:03.280> better<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.700> know<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.180> other<00:02:04.840> one

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
it's any better I know the other one

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.760 
it's any better I know the other one
with<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:07.090> bad<00:02:07.270> as<00:02:08.170> far<00:02:08.350> as<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.590> wind

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
with the pretty bad as far as the wind

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.590 
with the pretty bad as far as the wind
noise<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.280> definitely<00:02:09.910> got<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.149> do<00:02:10.330> something

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
noise so definitely got to do something

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.810 
noise so definitely got to do something
about<00:02:10.660> that
