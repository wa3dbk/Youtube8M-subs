00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:54.619
 my place is about russia or axis in general 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 here is so empty practically it 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.930
 Australian company is very specific 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 pretty pretty intrusive 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.410
 I like the smell but already fed up 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 the mask is just crazy very cool 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.090
 they know she's a bit of paraben not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.310
 paraben but 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.680
 hair was just a shock and after you already 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.530
 all the empty cans fall and this is mine 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.540
 full always buy like principle 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.490
 I even have to go with myself 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.950
 small jars take with me to fitness 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.440
 but this is more like it because they do not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.840
 I know why more hair glistens and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 the third place is a remedy for the bathead too 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.310
 already almost empty 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.030
 but there is something else that is extreme 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.980
 builds it to give hair in 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 Generally such evenness that they were 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.930
 straight she really works 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.550
 still a little then comb 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.489
 ironing in general a good series like 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.570
 me about slit batchat always buy always at 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.220
 I have in general sometimes for 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.560
 how would that hair I did not get used to them 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.690
 alternating kerastase I have already thrown my own 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.540
 until I use it in general I want 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.370
 while the use of these funds poses 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 so still such a mask I have lies with me and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.750
 almost never use enough 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.209
 long ago but I have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.329
 from phyton so called well so on 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 C grade and oil is unchanged to me Morocco 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.190
 but also 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.320
 l'oreal my dick while my dick but he 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.750
 me still in shopping is in the box 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.660
 show you in shopping because recently 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.930
 traveled of tears bought here such from me 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.100
 modest hair care 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.470
 You know, I want to tell you that I have hair 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 good normal therefore principle 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.360
 Extremely expensive or good 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.850
 i don't need care i use these 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.480
 that's pretty basic 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.790
 and the principle is not expensive because 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.890
 that when they buy expensive products in 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.810
 principle the effect is the same so it is not 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.160
 I see the point 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.930
 masks will really get rid of because 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.530
 almost as she is my good 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.700
 I will say goodbye to you so I today 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 win some kind of swollen something 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.250
 the mirror is all well bye bye
