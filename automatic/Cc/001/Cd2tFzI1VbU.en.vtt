 May 10 mothers day as is the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.790
 today I do not come to ruin the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.310
 spirit of the whole world and fill it with 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.660
 disappointments towards the human race from 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.030
 Some time ago I was given to adopt the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.920
 idea that this kind of holidays 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.110
 it is merely a mere act 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.970
 commercial and lacking real meaning 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.830
 Well, as many say, it's not enough 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.500
 dedicate the mother to the couple 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.080
 father to family or friends a single 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.880
 day of the year if every day we can show 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.180
 our love towards all these people 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.420
 but let's be honest who does that today 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 I come to talk about pretty mothers 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.230

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.660
 a time and to whom most of the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.420
 Sometimes we underestimate and underestimate 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.339
 rude way before anything 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.890
 I want to emphasize I wanted to keep this 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.810
 video as clean as possible 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.700
 to make it a little more familiar and that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.000
 You can enjoy it in the company of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.560
 strength and support to get ahead of 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.330
 all my problems but above all I 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:35.000
 someone could give me a xbox 360 and hey 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.100
 I say it in life despite all the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.440
