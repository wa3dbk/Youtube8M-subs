roughly about a half a bag I think if

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.880 
roughly about a half a bag I think if
you're<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.990> actually<00:02:36.200> measure<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.740> by

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
you're going to actually measure it by

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.390 
you're going to actually measure it by
volume<00:02:37.370> somewhere<00:02:38.270> around<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.690> cup<00:02:39.280> we're<00:02:40.280> also

butter and that is indeed by volume and
then<00:02:48.410> also<00:02:48.740> we're<00:02:49.280> going<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.760> add<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
then also we're going to add just a

fine if it's a cool dark place so two

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.660 
fine if it's a cool dark place so two
minutes<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.160> won't<00:03:43.310> notice<00:03:43.610> any

minutes and you won't notice any
difference<00:03:44.120> here<00:03:44.590> I'm<00:03:45.590> going<00:03:45.710> to<00:03:45.770> go<00:03:45.950> ahead

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
difference here I'm going to go ahead

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.940 
difference here I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:46.460> turn<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.600> on<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.840> see<00:03:48.320> where<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.740> get

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
and turn this on and see where we get

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.320 
and turn this on and see where we get
this<00:03:49.190> should<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.820> said<00:03:50.000> you're<00:03:50.090> not<00:03:50.210> going

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
this should like I said you're not going

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.820 
this should like I said you're not going
to<00:03:50.390> see<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> lot<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.690> difference<00:03:51.050> on<00:03:51.200> top<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.710> if

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
to see a lot of difference on top but if

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.860 
to see a lot of difference on top but if
you<00:03:51.950> rub<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> spatula<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.330> there<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.600> can<00:03:53.720> see

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
you rub a spatula in there you can see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.560 
you rub a spatula in there you can see
these<00:03:54.050> chips<00:03:54.410> are<00:03:54.560> definitely<00:03:55.280> melting<00:03:55.570> so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
these chips are definitely melting so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.490 
these chips are definitely melting so
let's<00:03:57.380> let's<00:03:58.100> mix<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.520> stuff<00:04:00.250> start<00:04:01.250> low<00:04:01.490> and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
let's let's mix this stuff start low and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.890 
let's let's mix this stuff start low and
then<00:04:03.760> once<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.880> gets<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.090> little<00:04:05.240> integrated

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
then once it gets a little integrated

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:16.180 
then once it gets a little integrated
you<00:04:06.050> can<00:04:06.170> really<00:04:06.440> put<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.709> Spurs<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.100> it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.640 

alright<00:04:17.030> well<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.690> can<00:04:17.840> kind<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.080> see<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.410> here

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
alright well you can kind of see it here

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.250 
alright well you can kind of see it here
well<00:04:19.040> maybe<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:19.310> can't<00:04:19.640> but<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:20.000> as<00:04:20.450> you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
well maybe you can't but I can as you

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.240 
well maybe you can't but I can as you
add<00:04:21.410> more<00:04:21.440> air<00:04:21.920> into<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:22.400> it's<00:04:23.030> going<00:04:23.420> to

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
add more air into this it's going to

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.590 
add more air into this it's going to
lighten<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.460> color<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.000> that's<00:04:26.240> going<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.420> let

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
lighten in color and that's going to let

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.400 
lighten in color and that's going to let
you<00:04:26.720> know<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.870> you're<00:04:27.170> changing

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.470 
you know that you're changing
consistency<00:04:28.370> i<00:04:28.400> mean<00:04:28.550> remember<00:04:28.670> we<00:04:29.000> got<00:04:29.120> cream

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
consistency i mean remember we got cream

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.150 
consistency i mean remember we got cream
in<00:04:29.660> there<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.350> we're<00:04:30.440> kind<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.680> whipping<00:04:31.040> that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
in there so we're kind of whipping that

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.490 
in there so we're kind of whipping that
cream<00:04:31.430> getting<00:04:31.790> some<00:04:31.910> air<00:04:32.090> into<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:32.930> this

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
cream getting some air into it so this

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.200 
cream getting some air into it so this
is<00:04:33.650> just<00:04:33.830> about<00:04:34.010> done<00:04:34.280> but<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:34.730> still<00:04:35.000> pretty

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
is just about done but it's still pretty

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.060 
is just about done but it's still pretty
warm<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.320> stuff's<00:04:36.530> going<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.770> set<00:04:36.950> up

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
warm and this stuff's going to set up

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.090 
warm and this stuff's going to set up
surprisingly<00:04:37.700> well<00:04:38.030> once<00:04:38.680> once<00:04:39.680> we<00:04:39.860> start

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
surprisingly well once once we start

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.470 
surprisingly well once once we start
spreading<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.640> letting<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.030> cool<00:04:41.180> in<00:04:41.420> a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
spreading it letting it cool in a

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.040 
spreading it letting it cool in a
cupcake<00:04:45.190> alright<00:04:46.190> we've<00:04:46.460> beat<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.420> plenty<00:04:47.720> I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
cupcake alright we've beat that plenty I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.220 
cupcake alright we've beat that plenty I
think<00:04:48.890> we're<00:04:49.100> going<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.310> call<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:49.520> good<00:04:50.230> take

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
think we're going to call that good take

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:01.030 
think we're going to call that good take
it<00:04:51.350> out<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.530> there<00:04:51.800> oh<00:04:55.810> yeah<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.780> we've<00:05:00.560> got<00:05:00.800> a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
it out of there oh yeah so we've got a

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.480 
it out of there oh yeah so we've got a
little<00:05:01.520> bit<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.880> lift<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:03.020> but<00:05:03.920> not<00:05:04.250> a

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
little bit of lift to this but not a

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.840 
little bit of lift to this but not a
whole<00:05:04.640> lot<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:05.630> mean<00:05:06.260> but<00:05:07.130> here's<00:05:07.400> kind<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.760> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
whole lot I mean but here's kind of the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.820 
whole lot I mean but here's kind of the
moment<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.210> truth<00:05:08.270> here<00:05:08.630> it's<00:05:08.930> it's<00:05:09.470> going<00:05:09.770> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
moment of truth here it's it's going to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.400 
moment of truth here it's it's going to
start<00:05:10.120> setting<00:05:11.120> up<00:05:11.210> on<00:05:11.450> you<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:11.810> you've<00:05:12.230> got<00:05:12.350> a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
start setting up on you and you've got a

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.110 
start setting up on you and you've got a
choice<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.740> make<00:05:12.980> here<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.460> can<00:05:13.610> let<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:13.970> cool

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
choice to make here you can let it cool

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.120 
choice to make here you can let it cool
down<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.450> little<00:05:14.750> bit<00:05:14.930> more<00:05:15.140> and<00:05:15.350> then<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:15.950> can

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
down a little bit more and then you can

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.850 
down a little bit more and then you can
whip<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.700> little<00:05:17.180> bit<00:05:17.390> more<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:18.320> once<00:05:18.680> it

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
whip it a little bit more but once it

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.590 
whip it a little bit more but once it
sets<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.430> sets<00:05:19.730> you're<00:05:20.150> going<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.330> have<00:05:20.450> to

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
sets it sets you're going to have to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.850 
sets it sets you're going to have to
take<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.870> back<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.200> microwave<00:05:21.560> or

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
take it back to the microwave or

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.070 
take it back to the microwave or
something<00:05:22.190> in<00:05:22.340> order<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.700> get<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.080> to

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
something in order to get it to to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.960 
something in order to get it to to
really<00:05:24.260> form<00:05:24.710> up<00:05:24.890> but<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.490> know<00:05:25.610> I'm<00:05:25.700> feeling

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
really form up but you know I'm feeling

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.730 
really form up but you know I'm feeling
kind<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.150> lazy<00:05:26.330> today<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.990> mean<00:05:27.200> after<00:05:27.710> all

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
kind of lazy today I mean after all

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.920 
kind of lazy today I mean after all
these<00:05:28.010> are<00:05:28.070> box<00:05:28.370> cupcakes<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.120> let's<00:05:29.330> not<00:05:29.480> get

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
these are box cupcakes so let's not get

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.110 
these are box cupcakes so let's not get
out<00:05:30.230> of<00:05:30.260> hand<00:05:30.560> here<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.400> think<00:05:31.669> what<00:05:31.880> we<00:05:32.000> can

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
out of hand here and I think what we can

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.570 
out of hand here and I think what we can
probably<00:05:32.510> do<00:05:32.660> here<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.140> this<00:05:34.010> is<00:05:34.190> still<00:05:34.400> loose

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
probably do here is this is still loose

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.010 
probably do here is this is still loose
enough<00:05:34.850> and<00:05:35.030> warm<00:05:35.210> enough<00:05:35.419> I'm<00:05:35.600> just<00:05:35.810> going<00:05:35.960> to

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
enough and warm enough I'm just going to

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:47.240 
enough and warm enough I'm just going to
dip<00:05:36.230> these<00:05:36.410> so<00:05:39.130> then<00:05:40.130> we<00:05:40.340> go

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.220 

and<00:05:48.250> those<00:05:49.030> are<00:05:49.060> going<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.390> those<00:05:49.960> are<00:05:50.080> going

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
and those are going to those are going

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.660 
and those are going to those are going
to<00:05:50.290> dry<00:05:50.530> nicely<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.070> mean<00:05:51.340> you're<00:05:51.520> going<00:05:51.610> to

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
to dry nicely I mean you're going to

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.290 
to dry nicely I mean you're going to
you're<00:05:52.060> going<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.240> see<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.510> set<00:05:53.760> frosting<00:05:54.760> layer

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
you're going to see a set frosting layer

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.550 
you're going to see a set frosting layer
on<00:05:55.480> there<00:05:55.690> from<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.350> ganache<00:05:56.530> and<00:05:58.560> let's

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
on there from the this ganache and let's

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.960 
on there from the this ganache and let's
face<00:05:59.770> it<00:06:00.010> this<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.190> a<00:06:00.310> heck<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.700> a<00:06:00.790> lot<00:06:00.910> easier

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
face it this is a heck of a lot easier

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.780 
face it this is a heck of a lot easier
than<00:06:01.360> spreading<00:06:01.780> butter<00:06:02.140> cream<00:06:02.580> but<00:06:03.580> if<00:06:03.670> you

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
than spreading butter cream but if you

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.130 
than spreading butter cream but if you
want<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.060> spread<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:04.360> just<00:06:04.690> let<00:06:04.870> it<00:06:04.900> cool<00:06:05.080> a

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
want to spread it just let it cool a

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.980 
want to spread it just let it cool a
little<00:06:05.260> bit<00:06:05.590> more<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:05.830> whip<00:06:06.100> it<00:06:06.130> some<00:06:06.820> and<00:06:07.420> by

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
little bit more and whip it some and by

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
little bit more and whip it some and by
the<00:06:08.050> way<00:06:08.260> this<00:06:08.500> recipe<00:06:09.070> is<00:06:09.280> enough<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:10.300> cover

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
the way this recipe is enough to cover

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.430 
the way this recipe is enough to cover
two<00:06:12.010> layers<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.880> like<00:06:13.720> an<00:06:13.900> eight<00:06:14.080> or<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.380> nine

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
two layers of like an eight or a nine

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.020 
two layers of like an eight or a nine
inch<00:06:14.860> cake<00:06:15.160> you<00:06:15.310> could<00:06:15.430> probably<00:06:15.580> do<00:06:15.760> a<00:06:15.790> nine

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
inch cake you could probably do a nine

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.160 
inch cake you could probably do a nine
by<00:06:16.210> thirteen<00:06:16.780> in<00:06:17.110> there<00:06:18.100> too<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:19.050> it<00:06:20.050> would

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
by thirteen in there too and it would

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:27.470 
by thirteen in there too and it would
work<00:06:20.350> just<00:06:20.620> fine<00:06:20.920> a<00:06:21.780> little<00:06:22.780> fall<00:06:23.260> theme<00:06:23.680> here

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.980 

decorating<00:06:28.480> doesn't<00:06:29.080> get<00:06:29.320> much<00:06:29.680> easier<00:06:29.950> than

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
decorating doesn't get much easier than

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:46.860 
decorating doesn't get much easier than
this<00:06:35.760> mmm<00:06:40.860> that's<00:06:41.860> really<00:06:42.250> good<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:45.750> mean<00:06:46.750> you

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
this mmm that's really good I mean you
