00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.810
 san diego california 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.269
 speedboats compete to classify 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.870
 for the national boat competition 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.870
 racing 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.080
 but there is an added danger in the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.080
 today's races 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.220
 they are in salt water 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.410
 what makes the boats float more and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.440
 are more prone to an incident 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.829
 the competitor of ferguson is about 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.829
 of knowing 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.950
 how fast can a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950
 problem 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.680
 a sling lifts the boat that goes to 274 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.230
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.800
 and in a matter of seconds it explodes in a thousand 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.800
 pieces 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.150
 from the shore his family observes with 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.090
 horror 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.080
 the launch exploded right in front of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 us in a matter of seconds and 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 we were terrified 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.250
 the rescuers run to the place of 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.250
 accident 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 they take the cabin out of the water without knowing 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 what conditions is the pilot 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.289
 then the capsule opens 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.950
 Ferguson has survived the accident 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.740
 only with a slight commotion what up 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.719
 he finds incredible I knew that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.520
 I was in trouble turn off the engine and 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.789
 try putting it back in the water 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.789
 but 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.830
 there was nothing I could do 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.930
 fortunately the security capsule 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.000
 Ferguson remained intact while 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 the rest of the boat disintegrated 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 but having had his wife and children 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.080
 as witnesses of that accident was a 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.980
 call alert I simply can not 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.739
 make them go through this 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.840
 Ferguson retired from racing and today 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.129
 the only moments that happens in the water 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.129
 are when you are on your yacht 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.580
 It is a decision that he and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.580
 your family can live
