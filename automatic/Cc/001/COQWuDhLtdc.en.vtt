using water or elfs mist and set spray
or<00:06:29.270> even<00:06:29.570> mac<00:06:29.890> fix+<00:06:30.890> and<00:06:31.340> for<00:06:32.330> me<00:06:32.510> you<00:06:33.200> know<00:06:33.350> to

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
or even mac fix+ and for me you know to

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.400 
or even mac fix+ and for me you know to
have<00:06:34.010> to<00:06:34.280> even<00:06:34.580> do<00:06:35.000> that<00:06:35.030> for<00:06:35.240> $50<00:06:36.020> for<00:06:36.260> this

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
have to even do that for $50 for this

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.110 
have to even do that for $50 for this
palette<00:06:36.860> was<00:06:37.280> just<00:06:37.520> a<00:06:37.610> little<00:06:38.000> bit

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
palette was just a little bit

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.070 
palette was just a little bit
disappointing

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
disappointing

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.500 
disappointing
so<00:06:39.590> this<00:06:39.770> palette<00:06:40.280> is<00:06:40.370> definitely<00:06:41.000> not<00:06:41.240> one<00:06:41.480> of

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
so this palette is definitely not one of

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.900 
so this palette is definitely not one of
my<00:06:41.720> favorites<00:06:42.410> everybody's<00:06:42.950> opinion<00:06:43.490> is<00:06:43.700> the

my favorites everybody's opinion is the

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.270 
my favorites everybody's opinion is the
same<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.510> you<00:06:44.540> know<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.230> may<00:06:45.470> be<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.710> favorite

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
same so you know this may be a favorite

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.150 
same so you know this may be a favorite
of<00:06:46.430> yours<00:06:47.000> but<00:06:47.720> for<00:06:48.020> me<00:06:48.170> personally<00:06:48.200> I<00:06:48.950> think

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
of yours but for me personally I think

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
Urban Decay I just can't understand why

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.600
