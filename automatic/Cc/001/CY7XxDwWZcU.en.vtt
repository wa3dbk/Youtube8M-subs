00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
mean fishery on Kokua is kokanee but

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.789 
mean fishery on Kokua is kokanee but
there's<00:00:02.730> also<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.480> landlocked<00:00:03.990> population<00:00:04.680> of

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
there's also a landlocked population of

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.650 
there's also a landlocked population of
coho<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.279> here<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.700> i<00:00:06.120> just<00:00:06.330> want<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.509> point

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
coho in here and i just want to point

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.059 
coho in here and i just want to point
out<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.960> differences<00:00:07.410> here<00:00:07.620> if<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.950> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
out the differences here if we can you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.830 
out the differences here if we can you
can<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> co<00:00:09.090> hole<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.480> see<00:00:09.660> it's

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
can see this is a co hole you see it's

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600 
can see this is a co hole you see it's
got<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.500> juveniles<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.250> I've<00:00:11.429> got

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
got the juveniles like this I've got

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.190 
got the juveniles like this I've got
heavy<00:00:11.759> spotting<00:00:12.300> all<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.630> right<00:00:12.900> onto

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
heavy spotting all the way right onto

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.049 
heavy spotting all the way right onto
the<00:00:13.320> tail<00:00:13.559> then<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> coal<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:14.940> you're

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the tail then the coal is really you're

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.760 
the tail then the coal is really you're
not<00:00:15.179> supposed<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> keep<00:00:15.719> them<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
not supposed to keep them but this is

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680 
not supposed to keep them but this is
about<00:00:17.100> generally<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> size<00:00:17.789> they<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
about generally the size they get to and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
about generally the size they get to and
then<00:00:18.900> these<00:00:19.080> fish<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> fish<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.859> size<00:00:20.039> will

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
then these fish that fish this size will

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
then these fish that fish this size will
actually<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.760> spawning<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.359> fall<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actually be spawning this fall in the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.840 
actually be spawning this fall in the
small<00:00:22.710> creeks<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> end<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> lake<00:00:23.550> but

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
small creeks at the end the lake but

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.759 
small creeks at the end the lake but
when<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:25.019> kokanee<00:00:25.439> we'll<00:00:25.590> show<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
when we get some kokanee we'll show you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
when we get some kokanee we'll show you
the<00:00:25.949> difference<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> kokanee<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> God

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the difference of kokanee of God

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
the difference of kokanee of God
virtually<00:00:27.390> no<00:00:27.539> spots<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> they're<00:00:28.710> just

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
virtually no spots and they're just

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.620 
virtually no spots and they're just
quite<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.519> different<00:00:29.820> looking<00:00:29.970> fish<00:00:30.240> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
quite a bit different looking fish but

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
quite a bit different looking fish but
that<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.320> juvenile<00:00:31.679> coal<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:35.340> fish<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that is a juvenile coal this fish is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:01:09.560 
that is a juvenile coal this fish is
probably<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.120> fourth<00:00:36.329> year<00:01:08.390> yeah<00:01:09.390> well

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
probably in this fourth year yeah well

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
probably in this fourth year yeah well
you<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> kokanee<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.439> quite<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> bit

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
you see the kokanee is quite a bit

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
you see the kokanee is quite a bit
thicker<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.400> quite<00:01:11.610> deep<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> militaries

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
thicker is quite deep in the militaries

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
thicker is quite deep in the militaries
that<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> bigger<00:01:13.770> eye<00:01:13.890> for

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that are really a bit a bigger eye for

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
that are really a bit a bigger eye for
the<00:01:14.340> size<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> fish<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.810> he's<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.590> few

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the size of the fish and he's very few

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
the size of the fish and he's very few
hardly<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:17.909> spots<00:01:18.780> maybe<00:01:19.259> sometimes<00:01:19.799> they

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
hardly any spots maybe sometimes they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
hardly any spots maybe sometimes they
have<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> few<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.210> few<00:01:21.479> or

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have a few on the back but very few or

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.640 
have a few on the back but very few or
none<00:01:22.610> really<00:01:23.610> nice<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> silver<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> these

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
none really nice and silver and these

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.020 
none really nice and silver and these
fish<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.220> size<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.729> fish<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
fish like this size sure this fish is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.380 
fish like this size sure this fish is
probably<00:01:27.180> 13<00:01:27.659> inches<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:29.040> March<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
probably 13 inches and in March this is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.030 
probably 13 inches and in March this is
June<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.020> March<00:01:31.259> these<00:01:31.530> fish<00:01:31.740> were<00:01:31.890> only

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
June and in March these fish were only

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
June and in March these fish were only
like<00:01:32.310> 10<00:01:32.610> inches<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.479> they're<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.900> coal

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like 10 inches but they're like coal

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
like 10 inches but they're like coal
same<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> ideas<00:01:35.400> coho<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.850> their<00:01:35.970> last<00:01:36.119> year

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
same as ideas coho in their last year

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
same as ideas coho in their last year
they're<00:01:37.049> spawning<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:38.280> doubled<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
they're spawning here they doubled and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
they're spawning here they doubled and
triple<00:01:39.270> their<00:01:39.360> size<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> matter<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> three

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
triple their size in a matter of three

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.480 
triple their size in a matter of three
months<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:43.229> yeah<00:01:43.590> they're<00:01:43.799> brothers<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
months like yeah they're brothers and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
months like yeah they're brothers and
yes<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> ocean<00:01:45.119> they're<00:01:45.570> four<00:01:45.840> year<00:01:45.990> old<00:01:46.110> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
yes the ocean they're four year old you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
yes the ocean they're four year old you
got<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> four<00:01:46.740> year<00:01:46.890> lifecycle<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
got a four year lifecycle and there is a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850 
got a four year lifecycle and there is a
few<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.899> spawn<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> source<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.799> like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
few that don't spawn a source just like

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
few that don't spawn a source just like
sockeye<00:01:50.369> they'll<00:01:50.939> come<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.630> fives<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sockeye they'll come back as fives and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
sockeye they'll come back as fives and
those<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.560> other<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.040> catch<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.700> 17
