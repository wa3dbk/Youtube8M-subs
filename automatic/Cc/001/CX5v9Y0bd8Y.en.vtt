00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello it's a pleasure for me to give you the 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.280
 Welcome to this space where 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.190
 carries out the yoyo vinitos program 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.710
 yoyo kilitos born as an alternative 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.500
 to give your body a respite from 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.269
 healthy and natural way the goal of a 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.939
 ditos is to eliminate from our organism 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.429
 the toxins and these toxins are inside 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.650
 of us whether caused by the medium 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.599
 environment for food feeding 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.670
 junk that we eat many times for the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.610
 work for alcohol then a data 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.800
 that is really clean internally 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.989
 to be able to have a much healthier life 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030
 among the objectives crimes is 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.710
 basically the main one is to feel 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.850
 well feel good with our body 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.700
 with ourselves 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.649
 apart that it helps us clean up our 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.440
 skin and obviously losing those pounds 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.809
 we have more than toks there are many 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.270
 but the one of us I lived all to 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.340
 difference from others what you have is 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.910
 that our program can be done in 3 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.220
 and 5 days is programmed in detail 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.780
 to really cleanse our body and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.180
 have these benefits that grant us 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 we do not eat the same thing every day 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.010
 so every day we have a diet 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.590
 different in this program the basis 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.960
 It is always based on fruit vegetables 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.970
 quality seeds where 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.130
 Our most important ingredient is the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 love that we put into the making of 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.240
 each of our products all 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.310
 our llodio vÃ­ctor products are 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.780
 made that same day in the morning 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.940
 so that when you give them 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.560
 let's deliver to you be fresh and with the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.899
 better quality so they can be 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.190
 consumed throughout the day there is a 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.440
 important point that I want to mention 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.440
 here and about a detoxification because 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.000
 what we really do, I militate is 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.369
 detoxify our body therefore 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 this has side effects in 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.659
 our organism and what do I mean with 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.330
 this this in this process of 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.149
 detoxification we can feel nauseous 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.479
 we can hurt our heads we can 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.100
 dizzy we can not read a bit 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 the stomach good all this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.179
 It is a consequence of our organism 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660
 is detoxifying then 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.510
 obviously between you more have eaten a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.370
 bad food junk food 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.890
 it's a lot more meat obviously you 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.200
 organism will have a greater effect 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.760
 towards coughs but nothing else you have 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 to keep in mind that this is temporary 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.319
 and that is part of your body to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.440
 cleanse so you can feel a lot 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.209
