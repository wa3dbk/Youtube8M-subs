we'll<00:00:59.600> see<00:00:59.780> if<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.930> ever<00:01:00.050> get<00:01:00.200> around<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.680> it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
we'll see if I ever get around to it

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.350 
we'll see if I ever get around to it
maybe<00:01:01.010> I'll<00:01:01.220> sell<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:01.880> think<00:01:02.060> there's<00:01:02.210> still

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
maybe I'll sell it I think there's still

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.270 
maybe I'll sell it I think there's still
a<00:01:02.390> pretty<00:01:02.510> good<00:01:02.720> market<00:01:02.960> for<00:01:03.290> it<00:01:03.410> as<00:01:03.800> long<00:01:04.100> as

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
a pretty good market for it as long as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.350 
a pretty good market for it as long as
you've<00:01:04.850> kept<00:01:05.090> it<00:01:05.210> in<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.420> freezer<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:08.210> nice

you've kept it in the freezer the nice

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.570 
you've kept it in the freezer the nice
thing<00:01:08.540> about<00:01:08.570> digital<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.530> fully<00:01:10.280> capable

filter<00:01:23.770> over<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> sensor<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.119> only

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
filter over the sensor and that only

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.350 
filter over the sensor and that only
allows<00:01:27.560> visible<00:01:28.100> light<00:01:28.310> through<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.790> filters

infrared<00:01:41.600> light<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.260> there<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:44.060> those

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
infrared light in there and with those

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.560 
infrared light in there and with those
ones<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.930> shoot<00:01:45.200> by<00:01:46.040> buying<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.580> infrared

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
ones you can shoot by buying a infrared

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.120 
ones you can shoot by buying a infrared
business<00:01:47.840> by<00:01:47.960> buying<00:01:48.200> an<00:01:48.350> infrared<00:01:48.590> filter<00:01:48.979> to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
business by buying an infrared filter to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.820 
business by buying an infrared filter to
place<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.670> front<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.060> lens<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:51.410> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
place in front of the lens this the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.620 
place in front of the lens this the
disadvantages<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:52.910> that<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.479> you're

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
disadvantages with that is that you're

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.900 
disadvantages with that is that you're
gonna<00:01:53.690> have<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:54.050> very<00:01:54.920> long<00:01:55.039> exposure<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.880> you

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
gonna have a very long exposure so you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.900 
gonna have a very long exposure so you
can't<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:56.509> not<00:01:56.630> really<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.899> caring<00:01:57.380> around

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
can't it's not really a caring around

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.219 
can't it's not really a caring around
setup<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.330> have<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> tripod<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.050> it's

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
setup you have to have a tripod and it's

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.740 
setup you have to have a tripod and it's
normally<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.009> seconds<00:02:01.429> -<00:02:01.700> I've<00:02:02.479> heard

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
normally in the seconds - I've heard

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.060 
normally in the seconds - I've heard
minutes<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.440> haven't<00:02:03.560> really<00:02:03.800> looked<00:02:03.890> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
minutes but I haven't really looked it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.460 
minutes but I haven't really looked it
up<00:02:04.160> lately

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
up lately

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.990 
up lately
the<00:02:06.470> other<00:02:06.679> option<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.399> convert<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the other option is you convert the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000 
the other option is you convert the
camera<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.540> dedicated<00:02:11.780> infrared<00:02:12.560> camera

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
camera to to a dedicated infrared camera

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.620 
camera to to a dedicated infrared camera
and<00:02:13.340> what<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.210> remove<00:02:14.360> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and what you do is you remove that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.870 
and what you do is you remove that
filter<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.980> current<00:02:16.310> filter<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
filter the current filter that the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.050 
filter the current filter that the
manufacturer<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.660> placed<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.819> put<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.850> new

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
manufacturer is placed and you put a new

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.360 
manufacturer is placed and you put a new
one<00:02:20.210> in<00:02:20.270> now<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.810> requires<00:02:21.110> some<00:02:21.560> surgery

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
one in now that requires some surgery

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.330 
one in now that requires some surgery
and<00:02:23.110> opening<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.230> camera<00:02:24.710> disassembling

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and opening up the camera disassembling

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
and opening up the camera disassembling
it<00:02:25.550> down<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> sensor<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.600> removing<00:02:27.080> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
it down to the sensor and removing it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.059 
it down to the sensor and removing it
and<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.770> might<00:02:27.920> scare<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.310> lot<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.550> people

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
and that might scare a lot of people

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.430 
and that might scare a lot of people
basically<00:02:31.069> I've<00:02:31.580> shot<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.270> time-lapse<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:33.170> me

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
basically I've shot a time-lapse of me

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.800 
basically I've shot a time-lapse of me
doing<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.950> conversion<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.640> my<00:02:34.850> nikon<00:02:35.420> d80

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
doing the conversion on my nikon d80

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.650 
doing the conversion on my nikon d80
which<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.710> see<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.540> to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
which you can see here so I have to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.320 
which you can see here so I have to
completely<00:02:39.020> disassemble<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> camera<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.150> go

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
completely disassemble the camera and go

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.940 
completely disassemble the camera and go
in<00:02:41.569> and<00:02:41.870> you'll<00:02:42.680> see<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.300> infrared

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
in and you'll see the the infrared

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.330 
in and you'll see the the infrared
filter<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.790> dark<00:02:47.000> one<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:48.140> non<00:02:48.770> infrared

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
filter is the dark one the non infrared

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.640 
filter is the dark one the non infrared
filter<00:02:49.730> or<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.300> normal<00:02:50.750> manufacturer<00:02:51.320> one<00:02:51.470> is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
filter or the normal manufacturer one is

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.400 
filter or the normal manufacturer one is
kind<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> light<00:02:52.160> blue<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:53.050> now<00:02:54.050> after<00:02:54.350> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
kind of the light blue one now after I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.150 
kind of the light blue one now after I
did<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.740> conversion<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.460> my<00:02:55.610> camera

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
did the conversion on my camera

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.630 
did the conversion on my camera
the<00:02:56.250> first<00:02:56.550> image<00:02:56.940> shot<00:02:57.810> looked<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.290> this

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the first image shot looked like this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.670 
the first image shot looked like this
now<00:02:59.640> after<00:03:00.000> changing<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.290> white<00:03:01.440> balance

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
now after changing the white balance

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.760 
now after changing the white balance
setting<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.460> custom<00:03:03.390> level<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.500> able<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
setting to a custom level I was able to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.790 
setting to a custom level I was able to
get<00:03:04.920> pictures<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.080> life<00:03:07.080> pixel<00:03:07.530> has<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
get pictures like this life pixel has a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.530 
get pictures like this life pixel has a
little<00:03:08.400> bit<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.670> tutorial<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.180> how<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.390> do

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
little bit of a tutorial on how to do

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.720 
little bit of a tutorial on how to do
that<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.170> it'll<00:03:10.320> vary<00:03:10.590> per<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.400> model

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that but it'll vary per make and model

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.250 
that but it'll vary per make and model
of<00:03:11.760> camera<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> other<00:03:12.750> thing<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.020> should<00:03:13.170> be

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
of camera the other thing you should be

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.660 
of camera the other thing you should be
aware<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.470> when<00:03:13.650> you're<00:03:13.800> shooting<00:03:13.950> infrared

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
aware of when you're shooting infrared

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.300 
aware of when you're shooting infrared
is<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.540> infrared<00:03:16.470> light<00:03:16.590> focuses

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is that infrared light focuses

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.250 
is that infrared light focuses
differently<00:03:17.730> than<00:03:17.910> visible<00:03:18.180> light<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
differently than visible light so you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.020 
differently than visible light so you
usually<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.130> focus<00:03:20.370> specially<00:03:20.940> if

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
usually have to focus specially if

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.080 
usually have to focus specially if
you're<00:03:21.090> trying<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.860> find<00:03:22.860> focus<00:03:23.490> on<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
you're trying to find focus on to the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.930 
you're trying to find focus on to the
subject<00:03:24.630> focus<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.460> front<00:03:26.850> of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
subject focus a little bit in front of

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.670 
subject focus a little bit in front of
them<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.750> you're<00:03:27.930> focusing<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> eyes

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
them so if you're focusing on the eyes

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.410 
them so if you're focusing on the eyes
you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.160> focus<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.700> little<00:03:29.850> bit<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.210> front

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you have to focus a little bit in front

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.450 
you have to focus a little bit in front
of<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.600> eyes<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.800> have<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> very<00:03:32.250> narrow

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
of the eyes if you have a very narrow

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.560 
of the eyes if you have a very narrow
depth<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.880> field<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> other<00:03:35.910> strategy<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
depth of field the other strategy is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.780 
depth of field the other strategy is
just<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:37.080> use<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> different<00:03:37.560> f-stop<00:03:38.160> use<00:03:38.610> an

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
just to use a different f-stop use an

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.310 
just to use a different f-stop use an
f-stop<00:03:39.000> number<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:39.990> bit<00:03:40.140> wider

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
f-stop number that's a little bit wider

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.140 
f-stop number that's a little bit wider
maybe<00:03:40.950> five<00:03:41.820> point<00:03:42.090> six<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.510> an<00:03:42.660> eight<00:03:43.070> eleven

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
maybe five point six or an eight eleven

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.580 
maybe five point six or an eight eleven
and<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.810> would<00:03:45.960> give<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.440> bit

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and that would give you a little bit

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.020 
and that would give you a little bit
wider<00:03:46.800> depth<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.190> field<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.670> don't<00:03:47.820> have

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
wider depth of field so you don't have

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.080 
wider depth of field so you don't have
to<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.330> as<00:03:48.480> accurate<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.890> other<00:03:50.070> thing<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.670> if

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
to be as accurate the other thing is if

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.940 
to be as accurate the other thing is if
your<00:03:51.240> subject<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.320> little<00:03:52.650> bit<00:03:52.770> further

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
your subject is a little bit further

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.370 
your subject is a little bit further
back<00:03:53.340> further<00:03:53.940> away<00:03:54.180> from<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.480> camera<00:03:54.840> then

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
back further away from the camera then

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
back further away from the camera then
that<00:03:55.890> automatically<00:03:56.400> widens<00:03:56.940> your<00:03:57.060> your

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
that automatically widens your your

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.020 
that automatically widens your your
depth<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.350> field<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.860> don't<00:03:59.790> have<00:03:59.850> to

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
depth of field and you don't have to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.390 
depth of field and you don't have to
worry<00:04:00.570> about<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.959> as<00:04:01.110> much<00:04:03.890> now<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.250> you're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
worry about that as much now what you're

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400 
worry about that as much now what you're
thinking<00:04:05.790> hey<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> want<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.840> do<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.110> was<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
thinking hey I want to do this was the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.060 
thinking hey I want to do this was the
cost<00:04:07.770> what<00:04:08.370> what<00:04:08.790> are<00:04:08.910> some<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.270> options

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
cost what what are some of the options

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.590 
cost what what are some of the options
my<00:04:11.070> suggestion<00:04:11.760> especially<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.390> you're<00:04:12.510> gonna

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
my suggestion especially if you're gonna

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.230 
my suggestion especially if you're gonna
do<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.870> yourself<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.500> find<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.490> old<00:04:14.700> camera

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
do it yourself is find an old camera

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.060 
do it yourself is find an old camera
body<00:04:15.450> used<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:18.390> convert<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.560> then

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
body used and then convert that and then

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.949 
body used and then convert that and then
you'd<00:04:20.220> have<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.430> dedicated<00:04:21.000> infrared<00:04:21.480> camera

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you'd have a dedicated infrared camera

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.250 
you'd have a dedicated infrared camera
and<00:04:22.140> your<00:04:22.410> your<00:04:22.770> normal<00:04:23.070> camera<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.990> used<00:04:24.990> an

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
and your your normal camera I used an

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.240 
and your your normal camera I used an
old<00:04:25.470> Nikon<00:04:25.980> d80<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.580> picked<00:04:26.850> up<00:04:28.190> now<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
old Nikon d80 that I picked up now the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.690 
old Nikon d80 that I picked up now the
filters<00:04:29.970> themselves<00:04:30.210> big<00:04:31.110> range<00:04:31.410> around<00:04:31.700> $200

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
filters themselves big range around $200

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.590 
filters themselves big range around $200
I<00:04:33.360> got<00:04:34.140> mine<00:04:34.470> at<00:04:34.500> life<00:04:35.220> pixel<00:04:35.820> they<00:04:36.060> seem<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.450> be

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
I got mine at life pixel they seem to be

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.590 
I got mine at life pixel they seem to be
a<00:04:36.630> pretty<00:04:36.900> reputable<00:04:38.360> manufacturer<00:04:39.360> that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
a pretty reputable manufacturer that

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.400 
a pretty reputable manufacturer that
they<00:04:40.470> have<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:42.000> think<00:04:42.930> they're<00:04:43.080> one<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
they have and I think they're one of the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
they have and I think they're one of the
more<00:04:43.560> pioneering<00:04:45.560> brands<00:04:46.560> they<00:04:47.400> also<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.850> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
more pioneering brands they also have a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.820 
more pioneering brands they also have a
lot<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.120> tutorials<00:04:48.540> on<00:04:48.960> their<00:04:49.200> website<00:04:49.620> how

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
lot of tutorials on their website how

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.800 
lot of tutorials on their website how
you<00:04:49.890> can<00:04:50.190> do<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.850> conversion<00:04:50.970> yourself<00:04:51.630> which

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
you can do the conversion yourself which

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.140 
you can do the conversion yourself which
I<00:04:51.930> find<00:04:52.320> really<00:04:53.010> handy<00:04:53.280> that's<00:04:53.460> what<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.669> use<00:04:53.940> as

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
I find really handy that's what I use as

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.110 
I find really handy that's what I use as
a<00:04:54.180> reference<00:04:55.130> if<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.220> do<00:04:56.490> go<00:04:56.700> with<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.970> life

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
a reference if you do go with the life

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.659 
a reference if you do go with the life
pixel<00:04:57.630> one<00:04:57.870> there's<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.530> reference<00:04:59.130> program

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
pixel one there's a reference program

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.450 
pixel one there's a reference program
where<00:04:59.880> if<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.690> refer<00:05:01.050> somebody<00:05:01.350> then<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.190> get

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
where if you refer somebody then you get

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.760 
where if you refer somebody then you get
a<00:05:02.490> little<00:05:02.730> bit<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.880> money<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.360> if<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.780> I'll

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
a little bit of money so a if you I'll

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.190 
a little bit of money so a if you I'll
put<00:05:05.160> my<00:05:05.280> reference<00:05:06.030> information<00:05:06.240> down<00:05:06.870> below

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
put my reference information down below

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.930 
put my reference information down below
and<00:05:07.350> if<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.590> use<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.010> really<00:05:08.340> appreciate<00:05:08.760> it

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
and if you use it I really appreciate it

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.740 
and if you use it I really appreciate it
but<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.390> know

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
but you know

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.150 
but you know
no<00:05:10.140> pressure<00:05:12.380> otherwise<00:05:13.380> they'll<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.920> the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
no pressure otherwise they'll do the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.230 
no pressure otherwise they'll do the
installation<00:05:14.610> for<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:14.910> think<00:05:15.000> it's

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
installation for you I think it's

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.350 
installation for you I think it's
somewhere<00:05:15.480> around<00:05:15.570> $400<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.790> I<00:05:17.790> don't<00:05:18.060> know<00:05:18.300> if

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
somewhere around $400 I I don't know if

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.230 
somewhere around $400 I I don't know if
that<00:05:18.510> means<00:05:18.750> 400<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:20.430> know<00:05:20.730> their<00:05:20.880> prices<00:05:21.150> are

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
that means 400 you know their prices are

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.190 
that means 400 you know their prices are
gonna<00:05:21.330> change<00:05:21.570> so<00:05:21.780> you're<00:05:21.900> gonna<00:05:21.990> have<00:05:22.110> to

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
gonna change so you're gonna have to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.380 
gonna change so you're gonna have to
look<00:05:22.320> yourself<00:05:22.500> I'll<00:05:23.130> have<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.430> link<00:05:23.640> below

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
look yourself I'll have the link below

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.260 
look yourself I'll have the link below
I'm<00:05:25.380> also<00:05:25.800> shooting<00:05:26.130> some<00:05:26.490> time-lapse

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
I'm also shooting some time-lapse

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.810 
I'm also shooting some time-lapse
infrared<00:05:27.930> stuff<00:05:28.320> I'll<00:05:28.650> be<00:05:28.980> posting<00:05:29.160> probably

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
infrared stuff I'll be posting probably

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.460 
infrared stuff I'll be posting probably
a<00:05:29.850> longer<00:05:30.210> video<00:05:30.360> in<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.780> future<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:31.230> here's

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
a longer video in the future but here's

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.950 
a longer video in the future but here's
a<00:05:31.530> sample<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.550> reason<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.150> trees<00:05:33.600> and

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
a sample the reason the trees and

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.500 
a sample the reason the trees and
foliage<00:05:34.620> turned<00:05:35.280> white<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.060> sky<00:05:36.270> turns

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
foliage turned white and the sky turns

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.050 
foliage turned white and the sky turns
black<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:36.990> because<00:05:37.260> plants<00:05:38.100> reflect<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.760> lot<00:05:38.940> of

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
black is because plants reflect a lot of

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.700 
black is because plants reflect a lot of
infrared<00:05:39.420> light<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.670> you<00:05:41.850> think<00:05:42.090> of

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
infrared light and so if you think of

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.560 
infrared light and so if you think of
just<00:05:43.710> visible<00:05:44.310> light<00:05:44.520> if<00:05:44.790> something<00:05:45.180> reflects

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
just visible light if something reflects

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.350 
just visible light if something reflects
a<00:05:45.720> lot<00:05:45.960> of<00:05:45.990> light<00:05:46.169> it's<00:05:46.919> usually<00:05:47.160> white<00:05:47.610> if<00:05:48.000> it

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
a lot of light it's usually white if it

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.730 
a lot of light it's usually white if it
doesn't<00:05:48.570> reflect<00:05:48.690> very<00:05:48.990> much<00:05:49.230> light<00:05:49.500> it's

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
doesn't reflect very much light it's

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.610 
doesn't reflect very much light it's
black<00:05:50.070> so<00:05:50.450> trees<00:05:51.450> reflect<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.960> lot<00:05:52.140> of<00:05:52.290> infrared

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
black so trees reflect a lot of infrared

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.760 
black so trees reflect a lot of infrared
so<00:05:52.950> they<00:05:53.070> turn<00:05:53.280> white<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.790> sky<00:05:54.590> unless<00:05:55.590> you're

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
so they turn white the sky unless you're

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.040 
so they turn white the sky unless you're
looking<00:05:56.100> directly<00:05:56.460> at<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.730> Sun<00:05:56.870> you're<00:05:57.870> not

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
looking directly at the Sun you're not

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.360 
looking directly at the Sun you're not
getting<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.380> lot<00:05:58.410> of<00:05:58.530> interferin<00:05:58.919> light<00:05:59.130> that's

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
getting a lot of interferin light that's

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.610 
getting a lot of interferin light that's
why<00:05:59.520> this<00:05:59.580> guy's<00:05:59.850> blue<00:06:00.350> that's<00:06:01.350> on<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
why this guy's blue that's on the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.850 
why this guy's blue that's on the
opposite<00:06:02.040> end<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.400> spectrum<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:03.120> infrared

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
opposite end of the spectrum of infrared

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.780 
opposite end of the spectrum of infrared
so<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:05.010> you're<00:06:05.190> not<00:06:05.310> getting<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.640> lot<00:06:05.730> of

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
so that you're not getting a lot of

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.020 
so that you're not getting a lot of
infrared<00:06:06.240> light<00:06:06.570> coming<00:06:07.140> in<00:06:07.260> from<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.650> sky

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
infrared light coming in from the sky

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.310 
infrared light coming in from the sky
when<00:06:09.030> you're<00:06:09.180> not<00:06:09.330> pointing<00:06:09.690> towards<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.140> Sun

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
when you're not pointing towards the Sun

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.430 
when you're not pointing towards the Sun
so<00:06:10.590> that's<00:06:10.710> why<00:06:10.919> the<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.610> sky<00:06:11.820> turns<00:06:12.120> dark

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
so that's why the the sky turns dark

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.210 
so that's why the the sky turns dark
which<00:06:13.440> is<00:06:13.560> great<00:06:13.770> you<00:06:13.890> get<00:06:14.010> some<00:06:14.130> great

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
which is great you get some great

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.710 
which is great you get some great
contrast<00:06:14.790> with<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.030> clouds<00:06:16.280> also<00:06:17.720> water

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
contrast with the clouds also water

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.360 
contrast with the clouds also water
tends<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.229> absorb<00:06:19.560> a<00:06:19.710> lot<00:06:19.860> of<00:06:19.890> them<00:06:20.100> for<00:06:20.280> red

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
tends to absorb a lot of them for red

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.300 
tends to absorb a lot of them for red
light<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:20.729> that<00:06:20.760> turn<00:06:21.090> usually<00:06:21.510> gets<00:06:21.690> darker

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
light so that turn usually gets darker

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.040 
light so that turn usually gets darker
but<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.400> does<00:06:23.550> reflect<00:06:23.729> you<00:06:24.360> will<00:06:24.510> get<00:06:24.810> some

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
but it does reflect you will get some

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.080 
but it does reflect you will get some
reflection<00:06:25.590> of<00:06:25.710> them<00:06:25.860> for<00:06:26.040> a<00:06:26.070> light<00:06:26.310> so<00:06:26.610> don't

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
reflection of them for a light so don't

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.930 
reflection of them for a light so don't
don't<00:06:27.300> expect<00:06:27.600> you<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.780> go<00:06:27.930> away<00:06:27.990> completely

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
don't expect you to go away completely

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.909 
don't expect you to go away completely
people<00:06:29.940> kind<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:30.960> get<00:06:31.080> this<00:06:31.260> kind<00:06:31.500> of<00:06:31.530> ghostly

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
people kind of get this kind of ghostly

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.550 
people kind of get this kind of ghostly
look<00:06:32.640> almost<00:06:32.910> as<00:06:33.240> if<00:06:33.450> to<00:06:33.960> me<00:06:34.080> they<00:06:34.229> look<00:06:34.410> like

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
look almost as if to me they look like

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.480 
look almost as if to me they look like
maybe<00:06:35.190> they've<00:06:35.490> they've<00:06:36.240> been<00:06:36.479> there<00:06:36.960> drowned

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
maybe they've they've been there drowned

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.190 
maybe they've they've been there drowned
but<00:06:38.490> it's<00:06:39.000> kind<00:06:39.150> of<00:06:39.210> a<00:06:39.270> neat<00:06:39.419> look<00:06:39.660> the<00:06:40.020> nice

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
but it's kind of a neat look the nice

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.130 
but it's kind of a neat look the nice
thing<00:06:40.410> is<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.710> removes<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.220> lot<00:06:41.370> of<00:06:41.430> blemishes

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
thing is it removes a lot of blemishes

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.719 
thing is it removes a lot of blemishes
and<00:06:43.140> it<00:06:43.500> makes<00:06:43.680> them<00:06:43.770> look<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:43.979> lot<00:06:44.130> younger<00:06:44.370> so

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
and it makes them look a lot younger so

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:52.200 
and it makes them look a lot younger so
