00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
from that it's obviously looking pretty

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320 
from that it's obviously looking pretty
amazing<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.740> actual<00:01:17.250> images<00:01:17.369> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
amazing now these are actual images from

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
amazing now these are actual images from
the<00:01:18.570> game<00:01:18.979> I'm<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.159> sure<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.430> they're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the game I'm not sure if they're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.160 
the game I'm not sure if they're
cutscenes<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.740> they're<00:01:22.740> certainly<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
cutscenes but they're certainly not the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
cutscenes but they're certainly not the
sort<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> early<00:01:25.850> artwork<00:01:27.229> pre<00:01:28.229> game<00:01:28.640> creation

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
sort of early artwork pre game creation

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.870 
sort of early artwork pre game creation
so<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> actual<00:01:31.110> game<00:01:31.320> itself

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
so these are from the actual game itself

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.219 
so these are from the actual game itself
some<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> them<00:01:33.119> could<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.390> from<00:01:33.750> obviously

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
some of them could be from obviously

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
some of them could be from obviously
some<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.770> cutscenes<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.939> does<00:01:36.180> look

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
some with cutscenes but it does look

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380
