attracted you to Dark Knight
um<00:00:07.309> yeah<00:00:08.309> any<00:00:08.730> reason<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.059> wasn't<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.389> grew<00:00:09.599> up<00:00:09.660> in

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
um yeah any reason I wasn't I grew up in

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.900 
um yeah any reason I wasn't I grew up in
the<00:00:09.840> household<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.349> girls<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.280> there<00:00:11.790> were

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the household of girls so there were

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.060 
the household of girls so there were
very<00:00:12.360> few<00:00:12.480> Batman<00:00:13.080> comic<00:00:13.469> books<00:00:13.650> lying<00:00:13.860> around

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
very few Batman comic books lying around

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.019 
very few Batman comic books lying around
they<00:00:14.400> were<00:00:14.490> mainly<00:00:14.790> like<00:00:15.120> Archie<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> that's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
they were mainly like Archie so that's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.370 
they were mainly like Archie so that's
probably<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> only<00:00:18.480> reason<00:00:18.690> why<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.109> never

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
probably the only reason why I never

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.750 
probably the only reason why I never
grew<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.680> reading<00:00:20.000> Batman<00:00:23.689> but<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.720 
Nicholson did in Tim Burton's world
would<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> crime<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.190> when<00:01:02.190> Chris<00:01:02.520> came

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

what<00:01:08.040> world<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> would<00:01:09.060> be

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
what world it was that I would be

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
what world it was that I would be
playing<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> knew<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.130> open<00:01:11.460> for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
playing and so I knew it was open for

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.260 
playing and so I knew it was open for
fresh<00:01:12.330> interpretation<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> also

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
fresh interpretation and I I also

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
fresh interpretation and I I also
instantly<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.630> had<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.530> my

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
instantly kind of had something up my

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
instantly kind of had something up my
sleeve<00:01:19.130> which<00:01:20.130> happened<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.610> exactly<00:01:21.390> what

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
sleeve which happened to be exactly what

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
sleeve which happened to be exactly what
Chris<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> looking<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.610> sat

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
Chris was kind of looking for and we sat

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.350 
Chris was kind of looking for and we sat
down<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> shared<00:01:25.290> ideas<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.360> they

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
down and kind of shared ideas and they

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.890 
down and kind of shared ideas and they
were<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:30.570> went<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
were the same and so we just went with

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.280 
were the same and so we just went with
it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.630 
it
can<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> say<00:01:31.890> how<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> something<00:01:32.490> might

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
can you say how that something might

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.039 
can you say how that something might
differ<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:32.970> Jack<00:01:33.270> Nicholson's<00:01:33.659> portrayal

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
differ from Jack Nicholson's portrayal

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.620 
differ from Jack Nicholson's portrayal
how<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.280> y'all<00:01:35.759> years<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> check<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
how it will y'all years have to check it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
how it will y'all years have to check it
out<00:01:36.780> let<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.710> been<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.250> last<00:01:38.369> question

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
out let have been for the last question

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.539 
out let have been for the last question
so<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.259> complex<00:01:40.740> character<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.340> play

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so it was more complex character to play

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.060 
so it was more complex character to play
Bob<00:01:42.030> Dylan<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.689> a
