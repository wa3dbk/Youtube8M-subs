00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.680
 same evridica channel today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 present to your attention a smart review 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.389
 heading in which we will look at 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 various technological innovations 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 most startups 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.720
 presented on kickstarter all the most 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.109
 new is smart innovative here at max we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.109
 getting started 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 Today I will talk about on why Pine guys 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 and smeb sure about that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.080
 really smart watches should 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.970
 predstavat a standalone devaysa the 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.550
 have function fully without 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.710
 smartphone engagement obsessed data ideas 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 these guys created their watches which 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.820
 have a capacitive display with a diagonal of 24 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.199
 inches and a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 made by technology tft 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 this permission is officially 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 supported android 4 1 2 and therefore in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 the clock is not fully installed 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.940
 cut down google operating system 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.250
 Of course , all applications that support 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.720
 such entertainment should be quite yourself 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.410
 feel comfortable on this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.880
 device 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.950
 what is more striking is that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 The computing power of this gadget is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 watch installed dual-core 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 qualcomm snapdragon s4 processor 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.910
 running at clock speeds 1 and 2 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 GHz similar decision is still quite 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.479
 We recently installed a smartphone 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.160
 whether or not the flagship segment 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.190
 and now gets along in such a compact 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.170
 enclosure for various modules 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.759
 then the watch has cellular support 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.369
 second and third generation networks 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.250
 micro sim card required 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.840
 frequencies of Russian operators 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 supported therefore calls from m with 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.039
 youtube in browsing should not pass 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 problems for this go then also 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.660
 there is a wifi module with support 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.959
 standard n also pine stuffed 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.849
 different sensors are idps 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.209
 accelerometer 3-axis gyroscope and house 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.729
 tr 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.740
 as well as a digital compass so these 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.630
 smart watch coupled with applications from 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 the marketplace can also become 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.250
 sports accessory than fine 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.740
 installed two full rear cameras of 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.260
 matrix 5 megapixel plumage in goa 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.300
 video call camera 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 It is noteworthy that the flashes in the clock are also 2 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.980
 1 for the rear 1 for the front camera yet 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.540
 one moment is associated with a feature 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
 watch fixtures in order to 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.620
 use the back has to be removed 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.930
 this watch is from the strap 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.180
 as for the other characteristics 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.520
 the amount of RAM ram 512 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.580
 megabytes and the capacity of the polymer 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.909
 The battery is 810 milliamps 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
 hours, the developers promise 7 hours 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.879
 Internet surfing through Wi-Fi and 8 hours 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.100
 talk time 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.170
 which of course is not very much 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.060
 and I think on average 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 the clock will last no more than six hours 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 The project was successfully funded by 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.480
 kickstarter site despite the fact that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.530
 the creator was the need for it 100 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.080
 one thousand dollars 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 they collected over 800 the very first 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.410
 devices will go to users 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.600
 who donated their funds to 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.550
 kickstarter campaign time if you 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.890
 do not have time to do something on the site 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.170
 company open pre-order the following 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.720
 The clock device is available in two color 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 making it black white with volume 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.540
 memory 16 32 gigabytes there is also a version 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.520
 8 gigabytes of mass on all the module 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.130
 the cost is three hundred thirty 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.560
 five dollars or about 11 thousand 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.450
 rubles for the base model is it worth 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.300
 watches his visions to everyone decides for 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.190
 himself but obviously more than three 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 thousand people are interested in such 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.840
 to projects and on it all leave the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.820
