00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the samsung migration software which I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
the samsung migration software which I

it couldn't find or couldn't install on

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
it couldn't find or couldn't install on
the<00:00:58.379> partition<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.760> too<00:00:59.910> small

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the partition because it was too small

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.130 
the partition because it was too small
or<00:01:00.390> something<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.660> what<00:01:03.660> happened

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
or something like that so what happened

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
or something like that so what happened
is<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:05.040> believe<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.970> Windows<00:01:06.600> 10

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
is I believe is that Windows 10

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.770 
is I believe is that Windows 10
automatically<00:01:07.650> started<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> download<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
automatically started to download the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.090 
automatically started to download the
boot<00:01:09.990> files<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> everything<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.270> Samsung

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
boot files and everything to the Samsung

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200 
boot files and everything to the Samsung
migration<00:01:14.100> partition<00:01:16.400> which<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.670> only<00:01:18.060> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
migration partition which was only on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740 
migration partition which was only on
100<00:01:18.960> megabyte<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.070> Windows<00:01:20.549> 10<00:01:20.580> needs<00:01:21.420> at

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
100 megabyte and Windows 10 needs at

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
100 megabyte and Windows 10 needs at
least<00:01:22.400> 400<00:01:23.400> megabytes<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> easiest<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
least 400 megabytes so the easiest way

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
least 400 megabytes so the easiest way
to<00:01:26.549> explain<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> show<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
to explain this is to show it so if you
