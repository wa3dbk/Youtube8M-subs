00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
essentials mineral eye shadows so that I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.159

easier for traveling and things like

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.059 
easier for traveling and things like
that<00:03:12.939> I<00:03:13.269> did<00:03:13.510> one<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.200> far<00:03:14.409> to<00:03:14.709> make<00:03:14.859> sure<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
that I did one so far to make sure it

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.069 
that I did one so far to make sure it
didn't<00:03:15.280> change<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> color<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.269> things<00:03:16.900> like

didn't change the color and things like
that<00:03:17.139> but<00:03:17.590> i<00:03:18.040> actually<00:03:18.340> think<00:03:18.790> i<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.000> 15<00:03:19.780> bare

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that but i actually think i have 15 bare

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.460 
that but i actually think i have 15 bare
essentials<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.790> shadows<00:03:22.359> so<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:22.959> i<00:03:23.079> press<00:03:23.260> them

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
essentials I shadows so if i press them

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.020 
essentials I shadows so if i press them
all<00:03:23.560> it'll<00:03:23.889> fit<00:03:24.040> perfectly<00:03:24.430> into<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.669> palette
