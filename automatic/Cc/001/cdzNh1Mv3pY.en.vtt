00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
hit all three of those at the same time

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.620 
hit all three of those at the same time
and<00:01:28.430> we're<00:01:28.610> going<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.790> have<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.030> our<00:01:29.120> pinkie<00:01:29.600> on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.140 

and<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:39.140> basically<00:01:39.440> we<00:01:39.710> move<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.550> chord

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and then basically we move in to a chord

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.650 
and then basically we move in to a chord
which<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.540> open<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.580> second<00:01:43.580> fret<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:44.510> do

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
which is open a second fret and we do

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.460 
which is open a second fret and we do
the<00:01:44.780> same<00:01:44.960> thing

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:02:02.200 

so<00:01:49.130> let's<00:01:49.280> put<00:01:49.430> out<00:01:49.550> all<00:01:49.730> together<00:02:00.970> that's<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
so let's put out all together that's the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.660 
so let's put out all together that's the
intro<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.600> across<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.170> universe<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.860> here<00:02:04.550> we

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
intro to across the universe and here we

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.730 
intro to across the universe and here we
go<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.450> verse<00:02:05.690> it's<00:02:05.960> real<00:02:06.170> simple<00:02:06.380> we're

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
go to the verse it's real simple we're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.980 
go to the verse it's real simple we're
gonna<00:02:06.830> start<00:02:07.040> on<00:02:07.160> D<00:02:07.340> chord<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.619> minor<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.960> F

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
gonna start on D chord to be minor to F

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.740 
gonna start on D chord to be minor to F
sharp<00:02:12.800> minor

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
sharp minor

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.520 
sharp minor
then<00:02:15.750> e<00:02:15.989> minor<00:02:16.379> 7<00:02:18.379> then<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.650> 7<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
then e minor 7 then a 7 and this is a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.210 
then e minor 7 then a 7 and this is a
5-4<00:02:23.220> bar<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.000> count<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.390> five<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.900> then

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
5-4 bar so you count to five and then

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.190 
5-4 bar so you count to five and then
you<00:02:26.220> repeat<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.580> d<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.099> minor<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.810> F<00:02:30.840> sharp

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
you repeat it d to be minor to F sharp

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.339 
you repeat it d to be minor to F sharp
minor<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:34.560> e<00:02:34.590> minor<00:02:35.099> 7<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:36.510> time<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.580> G<00:02:38.580> minor

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
minor to e minor 7 this time to G minor

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:49.680 
minor to e minor 7 this time to G minor
and<00:02:40.910> then<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.239> into<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.810> d

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.040 

than<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.650> seven<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.600> then<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
than a seven and then you have the
