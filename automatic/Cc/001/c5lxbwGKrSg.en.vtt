00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.010
 so soon after we are here with the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.330
 divine unboxing I command spit no longer what 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.100
 you can see a little on the outside as it is 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.779
 I 'm also going to have a command here 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.789
 normal for you to see the comparison is 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.860
 a control of playstation 4 and 1 with what 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.330
 first of all let's open up though 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.030
 well I already tested it to see what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.680
 it works dry it is not going to be that it does not go 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:33.590
 whatever and well then opening it here 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.450
 fucking hidden and well then 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.020
 later I will also tell you how to get 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.540
 one of these and all that as you can see is 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.030
 pretty handsome and see if he focuses well 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.460
 today around here the truth is that quite 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.590
 smooth is very handsome the whole painting 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.809
 is a design like that of skulls and such that 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 it is green and good the truth that gives me 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.640
 much behind like other material and 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.290
 well over here if you see that now I'll talk 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 what are these the buttons 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 shield they have here as you see you 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.410
 It takes just to the fingers for these to 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.239
 the call of duty and that one to jump 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.940
 another to bend or slash 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.440
 for what you want to put it worth they are 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.720
 instead of the lever I had been told 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
 that part very fast and all that then 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.920
 the button to test it and one then the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 truth is that it is my first command is 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.009
 domes and tell them more than by the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.140
 levers that good he put them because 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.000
 I asked for it because I put it but what 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.590
 I preferred it to be studied 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 here you see what my 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.390
 name that serves to plug the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.399
 console you see how it shines changing 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.070
 color just as it commands from the broad and 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.750
 normal box turns blue 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.170
 red when they shoot you and all those 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.210
 things are also worth that I have put more 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.940
 that does not have a command as you see here 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.580
 is the original remote control the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 play 4 normal as you see for example 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.119
 the levers are how they are different what 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.820
 You see, I 've put the projects in 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.590
 three because they are so much more comfortable for me 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.270
 I told him to put the law 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.800
 explained analog of playstation3 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 because I do not meet much more 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.310
 comfortable with them so nothing kids 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.960
 here you have the truth that is pretty 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.080
 cool and you see that with the forever he gets 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.789
 of blue color and such the truth very handsome 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.649
 the skull design also say that 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.110
 shines in the dark so when 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.940
 It is night and such is the truth shines 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.260
 is that that is very very handsome and what 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.360
 I love it above all is that from behind 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.980
 The rough it because it engages the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 really quite well and ahead more 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.880
 well smooth is worth to see more comfortable of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.860
 that way so it's very cool as 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.690
 You see change a little color and it's 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.310
 basically because of the texture is like 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.739
 different kind of paint so that by 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.900
 here hook more and here it was very smooth 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.069
 it shines bright and the truth is very 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.109
 Handsome 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.840
 what else to say to you then nothing simply 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.480
 I will leave in the description both the channel 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.790
 of helium that makes them as your email to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 that you can contact him if you want 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.349
 a command you can already be that is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.079
 if you want a whole command and 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.519
 modified will cost you more expensive so 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.739
 if he sends you is your command and what 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.239
 modify it, I needed a command like that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.730
 I told him I wanted a whole command 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.709
 new and send it to me has already 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.189
 modified with everything I digital 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.290
 so this one controls exactly if 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.659
 the new buy some and all that for you 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 It will cost a total of approximately 120 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.530
 130 euros worth what this command is already 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.699
 you can ask him what you want 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.169
 ok because I for example here 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.969
 they can put bullets on these 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.949
 colors but to me that the truth is that 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.319
 it's not that I'm really cool, I prefer it 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.810
 so normal with buttons of a lifetime and 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.159
 what is the painting the name here 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.840
 you can put then what you the 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.120
 you win or what you can do as 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.310
 you want basically then it depends 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.319
 of what modified them because those 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.019
 will more or less be worth I also 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.540
 I bought do not think here and I'm going 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.370
 life so well just me 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.650
 I was very excited to have a command of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.790
 personalized that you put my name is 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.129
 above all and all that is what to me 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.620
 cool and nothing can just leave you 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.340
 as I said how it vibrates 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.129
 I do not know why it is vibrating 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.319
 and well then simply if you want a 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.670
 command of this I will leave your channel in the 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.200
 Youtube description that goes up 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.940
 several models in case you want to choose 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.830
 one in particular tell them then look 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.030
 I want this painting with the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.819
 buttons of the others like you 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.530
 you want and beige your videos and already like 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.510
 said I'll put gmail to ask 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.370
 tell him so I want this and I'm this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.019
 how much would it cost me like I said if I 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.910
 and sends you and you adding your 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.620
 it's going to cost a lot cheaper it's worth just 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.840
 the change will obviously cost if 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.760
 you want a new command will cost you what 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.440
 are the modifications plus the command is worth 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.790
 so nothing is worth the truth that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.070
 It's pretty cool, it made me a lot 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.560
 illusion to have a personalized command and 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.970
 nothing, I highly recommend you 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.650
 ask one of these if you have a channel 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.820
 of youtube delights us like me 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.130
 because the truth that deserves much the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 sorry and nothing I'm excited these 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.389
 days with the command took me two days ago 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.889
 and the truth I do not regret at all and 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.690
 nothing is worth it, I simply hope that you 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.760
 I liked that you voted like favorites 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.760
 See you in the next video ciao 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.660
