and strength and a scaling and dexterity
and<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> scaling<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> dark<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> infuse

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and a be scaling in dark when you infuse

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
and a be scaling in dark when you infuse
it<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:07.950> dark<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> worth<00:01:09.240> noting<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it with dark now it's worth noting that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
it with dark now it's worth noting that
if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> don't<00:01:10.320> infuse<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:10.890> anything<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
if you don't infuse it with anything I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
if you don't infuse it with anything I
think<00:01:11.760> after<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> upgraded<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> Plus<00:01:13.439> 8<00:01:14.010> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think after you upgraded it to Plus 8 or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
think after you upgraded it to Plus 8 or
9<00:01:14.400> something<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.390> does<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.930> an<00:01:16.020> S

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
9 something like that it does get an S

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100 
9 something like that it does get an S
scaling<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> strength<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.869> instead<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> e

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
scaling in strength and instead of a e

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
scaling in strength and instead of a e
scaling<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.680> dexterity<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.580> has<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
scaling and dexterity actually has a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
scaling and dexterity actually has a
descaling<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> something

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
descaling so that's kind of something

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
descaling so that's kind of something
worth<00:01:22.500> noting<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.880> something<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
worth noting that's something that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
worth noting that's something that
you're<00:01:24.540> gonna<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> weigh<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.890> out

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're gonna have to weigh your way out

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
you're gonna have to weigh your way out
yourself<00:01:26.490> whether<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> might<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
yourself whether or not that might be

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
yourself whether or not that might be
worth<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.040> better<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
worth it for me it was better for me to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
worth it for me it was better for me to
go<00:01:29.670> ahead<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> go<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> dark<00:01:30.750> infusion

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
go ahead and go with the dark infusion

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.109 
go ahead and go with the dark infusion
so<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> ended<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.159> doing<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:33.030> if

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so that's what I ended up doing but if

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.249 
so that's what I ended up doing but if
you're<00:01:33.240> running<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.509> strength<00:01:33.750> field<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you're running a strength field and you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.780 
you're running a strength field and you
have<00:01:34.290> nothing<00:01:34.860> invested<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.400> faith<00:01:35.610> or

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
have nothing invested in faith or

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030 
have nothing invested in faith or
intelligence<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:37.020> keeping<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> normals

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
intelligence then keeping it normals

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
intelligence then keeping it normals
probably<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.759> want<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.659> there

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
probably what you want to go with there

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
probably what you want to go with there
are<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> couple<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.130> pros<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> cons<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
are a couple of pros and cons to this

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
are a couple of pros and cons to this
weapon<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.689> honesty<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
weapon and in all honesty I'm kind of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
weapon and in all honesty I'm kind of
split<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> same

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
split I do like it but then at the same

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
split I do like it but then at the same
time<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> cons<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
time I really don't one of the cons that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
time I really don't one of the cons that
is<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.759> too<00:01:50.759> big<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> deal<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
is it really too big of a deal if you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
is it really too big of a deal if you
don't<00:01:51.630> mind<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:53.009> really

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
don't mind is that it is actually really

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
don't mind is that it is actually really
hard<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:54.630> took<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.110> amount<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
hard to get it took me a good amount of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069 
hard to get it took me a good amount of
time<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.060> finally<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.390> weapon<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.930> when

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
time to finally get this weapon and when

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
time to finally get this weapon and when
I<00:01:58.110> did<00:01:58.380> I'll<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.920> honest

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
I did I'll be honest

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.700 
I did I'll be honest
it<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.750> goes<00:02:00.869> back<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.409> guess<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it kind of goes back to I guess the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.069 
it kind of goes back to I guess the
love-hate<00:02:02.159> relationship<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.970> I've<00:02:03.420> gotten

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
love-hate relationship that I've gotten

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.990 
love-hate relationship that I've gotten
with<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> weapon<00:02:04.549> another<00:02:05.549> con<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.970> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
with this weapon another con that I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
with this weapon another con that I
really<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.780> has<00:02:07.229> some<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.399> has

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
really have and this has some it has

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
really have and this has some it has
something<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.179> PvP<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> fact

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
something to do with PvP is the fact

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.190 
something to do with PvP is the fact
that<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.130> hits<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.940> slow<00:02:12.180> all<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that it actually hits really slow all of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
that it actually hits really slow all of
the<00:02:13.290> moves<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.099> weapon<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.670> really

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the moves on this weapon are really

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.809 
the moves on this weapon are really
really<00:02:15.480> slow<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.250> even<00:02:17.250> though<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.519> is<00:02:17.550> an

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
really slow and even though it is an

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.130 
really slow and even though it is an
ultra<00:02:18.060> great<00:02:18.239> sword<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:18.750> actually

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
ultra great sword and that's actually

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.050 
ultra great sword and that's actually
you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.530> pretty<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.099> what's<00:02:20.430> expected<00:02:20.819> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you know pretty much what's expected of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.150 
you know pretty much what's expected of
it<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.319> something<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> kind<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> took

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
it this was something that kind of took

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.490 
it this was something that kind of took
me<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:24.150> getting<00:02:24.390> used<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.989> actually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
me a little getting used to I actually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
me a little getting used to I actually
haven't<00:02:25.860> played<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.459> game<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.239> week

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
haven't played the game in about a week

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.150 
haven't played the game in about a week
and<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> half<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.349> finally<00:02:28.590> decided<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and a half and when I finally decided to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.949 
and a half and when I finally decided to
jump<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.550> last<00:02:29.819> night<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.209> wanted<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.780> ahead

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
jump on last night I wanted to go ahead

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.080 
jump on last night I wanted to go ahead
and<00:02:31.080> knock<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.500> request<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:33.000> was

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and knock out this request that was

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.400 
and knock out this request that was
actually<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.690> bad<00:02:33.840> decision<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.380> should

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
actually kind of a bad decision I should

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.559 
actually kind of a bad decision I should
have<00:02:34.680> warmed<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.160> little<00:02:35.190> bit<00:02:35.489> because<00:02:35.910> for

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
have warmed up a little bit because for

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.840 
have warmed up a little bit because for
the<00:02:36.630> bout<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.319> about<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> first<00:02:37.920> 30<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.370> 45

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
the bout for about the first 30 to 45

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.370 
the bout for about the first 30 to 45
minutes<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.239> was<00:02:39.330> actually<00:02:39.660> having<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.110> really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
minutes I was actually having a really

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.650 
minutes I was actually having a really
tough<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.819> after<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:42.030> used<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.390> though

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
tough time after I got used to it though

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.750 
tough time after I got used to it though
it<00:02:42.870> actually<00:02:43.230> isn't<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:44.010> bad<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.430> weapon

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it actually isn't that bad of a weapon

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.180 
it actually isn't that bad of a weapon
when<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.930> hit<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.410> actually<00:02:46.980> hits

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
when you do get a hit it actually hits

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
when you do get a hit it actually hits
like<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> damn<00:02:47.610> truck<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:48.720> actually<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
like a damn truck so that's actually a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.320 
like a damn truck so that's actually a
huge<00:02:49.380> Pro<00:02:49.769> another<00:02:50.519> Pro<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.209> you're

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
huge Pro another Pro is that if you're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
huge Pro another Pro is that if you're
we<00:02:51.540> uh<00:02:51.569> if<00:02:52.049> your<00:02:52.260> person<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:52.950> pretty<00:02:53.160> much<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
we uh if your person is pretty much a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.699 
we uh if your person is pretty much a
strength<00:02:54.000> build<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.959> S<00:02:55.110> scaling<00:02:55.590> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
strength build and the S scaling is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.160 
strength build and the S scaling is
something<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.280> might<00:02:56.489> want<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.910> with

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
something that you might want to go with

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.600 
something that you might want to go with
especially<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.260> you're<00:02:58.380> using<00:02:58.620> other<00:02:59.250> ultra

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
especially if you're using other ultra

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.650 
especially if you're using other ultra
great<00:02:59.760> swords<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.209> you're<00:03:00.330> used<00:03:00.540> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
great swords and you're used to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.449 
great swords and you're used to
something<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.650> regular<00:03:01.799> great<00:03:02.190> sword

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
something like the regular great sword

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.670 
something like the regular great sword
or<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.090> pursuers<00:03:03.540> great<00:03:03.750> sword<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.530> is

or the pursuers great sword this is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.720 
or the pursuers great sword this is
something<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.160> might<00:03:05.310> want<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.579> check

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
something that you might want to check

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.370 
something that you might want to check
out<00:03:05.790> since<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> same<00:03:06.900> class<00:03:07.170> of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
out since it's in the same class of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.110 
out since it's in the same class of
weapons<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> fact<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:08.850> get<00:03:09.000> an

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
weapons and the fact that you do get an

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.849 
weapons and the fact that you do get an
S<00:03:09.209> scaling<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.750> strength<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.290> something<00:03:10.739> that

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
S scaling and strength is something that

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.220 
S scaling and strength is something that
you<00:03:10.950> want<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.280> ahead<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.579> try<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.720> wouldn't

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you want to go ahead and try I wouldn't

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.840 
you want to go ahead and try I wouldn't
pick<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.769> had<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.400> 40

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
pick it up if you had something like 40

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.670 
pick it up if you had something like 40
strength<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.390> you're<00:03:15.510> running<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:15.989> 50

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
strength but if you're running with 50

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.710 
strength but if you're running with 50
or<00:03:16.769> 60<00:03:17.160> strength<00:03:17.489> then<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.420> something

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
or 60 strength then this is something

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.930 
or 60 strength then this is something
you<00:03:18.780> might<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.140> huge<00:03:19.440> benefit<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.310> but

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you might get a huge benefit out of but

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.520 
you might get a huge benefit out of but
I<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.209> said<00:03:21.420> anything<00:03:21.810> lower<00:03:21.989> than<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.350> I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
I like I said anything lower than that I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
I like I said anything lower than that I
really<00:03:22.560> don't<00:03:22.980> see<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.430> getting<00:03:23.790> too<00:03:23.970> much<00:03:24.150> of

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
really don't see you getting too much of

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.360 
really don't see you getting too much of
a<00:03:24.450> benefit<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.140> scaling<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:26.220> keep

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
a benefit on the scaling so just keep

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.949 
a benefit on the scaling so just keep
that<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.549> mind<00:03:26.670> before<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.329> end<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.690> deciding

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
that in mind before you end up deciding

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.720 
that in mind before you end up deciding
what<00:03:28.230> you're<00:03:28.350> gonna<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.519> on<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
what you're gonna do on and on the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.280 
what you're gonna do on and on the
entire<00:03:30.030> experience<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> had<00:03:31.019> with<00:03:31.139> this

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
entire experience that I had with this

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.340 
entire experience that I had with this
weapon<00:03:31.470> was<00:03:31.739> actually<00:03:32.069> kind<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.400> crazy<00:03:32.639> one

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
weapon was actually kind of a crazy one

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.440 
weapon was actually kind of a crazy one
most<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> little<00:03:35.459> rough<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
most of it was a little rough in the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
most of it was a little rough in the
beginning<00:03:36.720> probably<00:03:37.200> because<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.889> hadn't

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
beginning probably because I hadn't

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.210 
beginning probably because I hadn't
played<00:03:38.549> in<00:03:38.910> about<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.420> week<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.780> half<00:03:40.220> most

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
played in about a week and a half most

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.559 
played in about a week and a half most
of<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.430> guys<00:03:41.519> probably<00:03:41.579> already<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:42.389> a

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
of you guys probably already know but a

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.870 
of you guys probably already know but a
patch<00:03:42.780> was<00:03:43.049> released<00:03:43.440> yesterday<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.310> I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
patch was released yesterday and I

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.110 
patch was released yesterday and I
really<00:03:45.180> wanted<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.720> how<00:03:46.730> different<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
really wanted to see how different the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.559 
really wanted to see how different the
PvP<00:03:48.569> was<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.609> I'll<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:50.730> honest<00:03:51.030> there<00:03:51.150> were<00:03:51.299> a

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
PvP was and I'll be honest there were a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.759 
PvP was and I'll be honest there were a
lot<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.780> different<00:03:52.139> things<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.530> saw

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
lot of different things that I saw

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.240 
lot of different things that I saw
lately<00:03:53.340> some<00:03:54.120> good<00:03:54.299> some<00:03:54.630> bad<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:55.470> won't<00:03:56.040> list

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
lately some good some bad I won't list

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.910 
lately some good some bad I won't list
the<00:03:56.340> bad<00:03:56.519> ones<00:03:56.790> because<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.569> really<00:03:58.049> don't<00:03:58.230> want

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
the bad ones because I really don't want

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.700 
the bad ones because I really don't want
to<00:03:59.010> try<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.220> promote<00:03:59.430> those<00:03:59.760> things<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
to try to promote those things and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.410 
to try to promote those things and
I'm<00:04:00.890> pretty<00:04:01.100> sure<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.460> guys<00:04:01.640> will<00:04:02.240> probably

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
I'm pretty sure you guys will probably

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.930 
I'm pretty sure you guys will probably
run<00:04:02.840> into<00:04:02.900> them<00:04:03.290> sooner<00:04:03.920> or<00:04:03.950> later<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:04.850> for

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
run into them sooner or later but for

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.910 
run into them sooner or later but for
the<00:04:05.000> most<00:04:05.180> part<00:04:05.270> this<00:04:06.200> weapon<00:04:06.530> kind<00:04:06.710> of<00:04:06.800> held

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
the most part this weapon kind of held

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.340 
the most part this weapon kind of held
its<00:04:07.100> own<00:04:07.220> keep<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.330> mind<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.720> my<00:04:08.960> character

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
its own keep in mind that my character

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.260 
its own keep in mind that my character
right<00:04:09.500> now<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.770> actually<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.460> top<00:04:10.940> tier<00:04:11.240> of

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
right now is actually at the top tier of

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.000 
right now is actually at the top tier of
the<00:04:11.480> saw<00:04:11.630> memory<00:04:11.990> so<00:04:12.320> all<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.740> fights<00:04:12.920> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
the saw memory so all the fights that

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.650 
the saw memory so all the fights that
you're<00:04:13.190> seeing<00:04:13.400> right<00:04:13.580> now<00:04:13.640> are<00:04:14.150> against

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
you're seeing right now are against

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.140 
you're seeing right now are against
people<00:04:14.930> who<00:04:15.110> are<00:04:15.470> either<00:04:15.860> in<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.760> three<00:04:17.120> or

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
people who are either in the three or

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.110 
people who are either in the three or
four<00:04:17.480> hundreds<00:04:17.960> or<00:04:18.140> even<00:04:18.340> probably<00:04:19.340> max<00:04:19.850> level

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
four hundreds or even probably max level

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.660 
four hundreds or even probably max level
I<00:04:20.510> didn't<00:04:21.050> fight<00:04:21.170> anybody<00:04:21.410> max<00:04:21.739> level<00:04:21.980> with

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
I didn't fight anybody max level with

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.610 
I didn't fight anybody max level with
with<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.360> weapon<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:23.810> pretty<00:04:24.320> much<00:04:24.440> what

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
with this weapon but pretty much what

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.900 
with this weapon but pretty much what
I'm<00:04:24.710> saying<00:04:24.920> is<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.220> all<00:04:25.340> these<00:04:25.490> guys<00:04:25.670> are

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
I'm saying is that all these guys are

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.880 
I'm saying is that all these guys are
really<00:04:26.060> really<00:04:26.150> high<00:04:26.480> level<00:04:26.510> all<00:04:27.230> their<00:04:27.680> stats

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
really really high level all their stats

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.790 
really really high level all their stats
are<00:04:28.130> pretty<00:04:28.430> bulky<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:30.170> still<00:04:30.410> held<00:04:30.620> its

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
are pretty bulky and it's still held its

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.190 
are pretty bulky and it's still held its
own<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.370> that's<00:04:31.760> why<00:04:32.090> it's<00:04:32.780> kind<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.110> a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
own so that's why it's kind of a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.680 
own so that's why it's kind of a
love/hate<00:04:33.590> if<00:04:33.800> you're<00:04:34.340> running<00:04:34.520> some<00:04:35.450> you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
love/hate if you're running some you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.450 
love/hate if you're running some you
know<00:04:35.810> decent<00:04:36.260> tier<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.680> guess<00:04:36.920> like<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.130> level

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
know decent tier I guess like a level

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.340 
know decent tier I guess like a level
150<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.210> want<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.480> use<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.750> weapon<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
150 and you want to use this weapon and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.290 
150 and you want to use this weapon and
your<00:04:39.800> cell<00:04:39.980> memory<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.310> not<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.610> high<00:04:40.790> I'm

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
your cell memory is not that high I'm

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.610 
your cell memory is not that high I'm
pretty<00:04:41.570> sure<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:41.900> can<00:04:42.020> start<00:04:42.260> doing<00:04:42.440> some

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
pretty sure you can start doing some

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.130 
pretty sure you can start doing some
massive<00:04:43.340> damage<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:44.240> for<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.450> most<00:04:44.600> part<00:04:44.690> it

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
massive damage but for the most part it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.670 
massive damage but for the most part it
was<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:46.220> little<00:04:46.640> frustrating<00:04:47.300> because<00:04:47.900> for<00:04:48.620> the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
was a little frustrating because for the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.190 
was a little frustrating because for the
people<00:04:48.950> who<00:04:49.100> are<00:04:49.400> running<00:04:49.930> builds<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.080> can

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
people who are running builds that can

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.620 
people who are running builds that can
take<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> lot<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.620> damage<00:04:51.920> this<00:04:52.460> weapon<00:04:52.970> didn't

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
take a lot of damage this weapon didn't

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.510 
take a lot of damage this weapon didn't
really<00:04:53.840> do<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.080> greatest<00:04:54.290> not<00:04:55.040> only<00:04:55.310> did<00:04:55.490> it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
really do the greatest not only did it

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.400 
really do the greatest not only did it
swing<00:04:55.880> really<00:04:56.060> slow<00:04:56.420> but<00:04:56.750> at<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.960> same<00:04:57.140> time

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
swing really slow but at the same time

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.230 
swing really slow but at the same time
when<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.650> finally<00:04:58.010> did<00:04:58.130> get<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.400> hit<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:59.030> didn't

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
when I finally did get a hit it didn't

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.180 
when I finally did get a hit it didn't
do<00:04:59.360> too<00:04:59.570> much<00:04:59.600> but<00:05:00.260> like<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.530> said<00:05:00.590> keep<00:05:00.920> all

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
do too much but like I said keep all

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
do too much but like I said keep all
that<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.970> mind<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.950> if<00:05:03.950> you're<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.820> lower

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
that in mind and if you're in a lower

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.300 
that in mind and if you're in a lower
soul<00:05:05.630> memory<00:05:05.810> tier<00:05:06.260> then<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:07.130> should

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
soul memory tier then you should

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.400 
soul memory tier then you should
probably<00:05:07.430> do<00:05:07.850> pretty<00:05:08.210> decent<00:05:08.630> but<00:05:09.200> that's

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
probably do pretty decent but that's

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.900 
probably do pretty decent but that's
pretty<00:05:09.590> much<00:05:09.710> gonna<00:05:09.860> wrap<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.130> up<00:05:10.340> let<00:05:10.670> me<00:05:10.760> know

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
pretty much gonna wrap it up let me know

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.370 
pretty much gonna wrap it up let me know
if<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.270> guys<00:05:11.390> have<00:05:11.630> tried<00:05:11.720> this<00:05:11.930> weapon<00:05:12.260> out

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
if you guys have tried this weapon out

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.430 
if you guys have tried this weapon out
and<00:05:12.410> let<00:05:13.070> me<00:05:13.100> know<00:05:13.190> how<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.640> went<00:05:14.170> for<00:05:15.170> the<00:05:15.290> most

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
and let me know how it went for the most

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.720 
and let me know how it went for the most
part<00:05:15.710> this<00:05:16.010> is<00:05:16.070> something<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.490> I'll

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
part this is something that I'll

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.940 
part this is something that I'll
probably<00:05:16.940> use<00:05:17.090> on<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.660> off<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:18.230> as<00:05:18.410> often<00:05:18.590> as

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
probably use on and off not as often as

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.560 
probably use on and off not as often as
some<00:05:19.310> of<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.700> other<00:05:19.880> weapons<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.390> I'm

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
some of the other weapons that I'm

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.060 
some of the other weapons that I'm
showcased<00:05:21.020> before<00:05:21.380> but<00:05:21.620> definitely

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
showcased before but definitely

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.860 
showcased before but definitely
something<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.430> if<00:05:22.910> I'm<00:05:23.180> feeling<00:05:23.330> bored<00:05:23.660> and

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
something that if I'm feeling bored and

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.660 
something that if I'm feeling bored and
I<00:05:23.930> feel<00:05:24.170> like<00:05:24.350> I<00:05:24.500> should<00:05:25.010> probably<00:05:25.040> use

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
I feel like I should probably use

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.010 
I feel like I should probably use
something<00:05:26.000> different<00:05:26.030> this<00:05:26.570> is<00:05:26.690> probably

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
something different this is probably

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.780 
something different this is probably
gonna<00:05:27.200> be<00:05:27.290> something<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.920> I<00:05:28.130> will<00:05:28.250> keep<00:05:28.670> in

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
gonna be something that I will keep in

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.250 
gonna be something that I will keep in
mind<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:29.540> other<00:05:29.720> than<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.870> like<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.230> said

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
mind but other than that like I said

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.480 
mind but other than that like I said
that's<00:05:30.560> pretty<00:05:30.740> much<00:05:30.890> gonna<00:05:31.040> wrap<00:05:31.250> it<00:05:31.280> up

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.980 
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up
