have the most amount of fact show you
guys<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> map<00:00:24.269> where<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.600> located<00:00:25.580> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
guys on the map where it's located so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.130 
guys on the map where it's located so
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.849> our<00:00:27.000> current<00:00:27.300> location<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
immediately got this at the beginning of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.410 
immediately got this at the beginning of
the<00:00:34.800> game<00:00:35.329> it<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:37.070> approximately<00:00:38.070> about

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
Southwest located southwest of Riverwood

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.500 
Southwest located southwest of Riverwood
or<00:00:42.230> northwest<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.469> Helghan<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:45.300> when

decide<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> activate<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.990> decide

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
decide to activate that you can decide

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920 
decide to activate that you can decide
not<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> activate<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
not to activate that this here is the

not to activate that this here is the
mage<00:01:25.200> stone<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.670> 20%<00:01:27.000> faster<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
mage stone and it will be 20% faster and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.300

so<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> common<00:01:29.070> theme

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so as you can see it's a common theme

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.240 
so as you can see it's a common theme
each<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.850> does<00:01:30.030> 20%<00:01:30.630> faster<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.070> learn

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
each one does 20% faster they will learn

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.380 
each one does 20% faster they will learn
those<00:01:32.549> particular<00:01:32.880> skill<00:01:33.299> set<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> user

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
those particular skill set now the user

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.319 
those particular skill set now the user
could<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:36.930> decide<00:01:37.579> which<00:01:38.579> route<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.119> want

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
could then decide which route they want

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
could then decide which route they want
to<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.750> which<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.170> feel<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> best<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to go in which they feel is best you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.850 
to go in which they feel is best you
only<00:01:41.130> could<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.549> once<00:01:41.930> stone<00:01:42.930> activated<00:01:43.740> at

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
only could have once stone activated at

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
only could have once stone activated at
a<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.210> ready<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.780> accept
