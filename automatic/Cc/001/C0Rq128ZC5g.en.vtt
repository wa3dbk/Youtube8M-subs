going to roll pretty directly straight

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.729 
going to roll pretty directly straight
forward<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> obstacle<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.649> know

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
forward at the obstacle and you know

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.080 
forward at the obstacle and you know
you're<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> ollie<00:00:41.219> before<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you're going to ollie before you get to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.639 
you're going to ollie before you get to
the<00:00:42.180> coping<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.230> tail<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> get

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the coping so that your tail can get

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.430 
the coping so that your tail can get
around<00:00:43.920> before<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.340> gets<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.670> onto<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> coping

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
around before it gets up onto the coping

around before it gets up onto the coping
backside<00:00:46.440> tailslide<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:47.250> similar<00:00:47.789> approach

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
backside tailslide very similar approach

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.209 
backside tailslide very similar approach
you're<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.590> rolling<00:00:49.829> quite<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you're just going to be rolling quite a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549 
you're just going to be rolling quite a
bit<00:00:50.430> faster<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.230> coming

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
bit faster and you're going to be coming

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
bit faster and you're going to be coming
at<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> lot<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> sideways<00:00:53.820> angle<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
at a lot more of a sideways angle to the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
at a lot more of a sideways angle to the
transition<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.850> once<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
transition so that once you get your

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
transition so that once you get your
tail<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> momentum<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.410> carrying

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tail on there your momentum is carrying

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.869 
tail on there your momentum is carrying
you<00:00:58.859> sideways<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.460> you're<00:00:59.579> actually<00:00:59.670> going

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you sideways and you're actually going

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.160 
you sideways and you're actually going
to<00:00:59.940> slide<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.660> stall<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:07.610> next<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
to slide not just stall on it next is a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
to slide not just stall on it next is a
once<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.740> comfortable<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.729> confident

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
once you are comfortable and confident

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
once you are comfortable and confident
with<00:01:12.299> getting<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> trick<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.619> going

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
with getting into the trick you're going

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
with getting into the trick you're going
to<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.310> push<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> through<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to want to really push it through this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
to want to really push it through this
trick<00:01:16.080> tends<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> stick<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
trick tends to like to stick a lot and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.630 
trick tends to like to stick a lot and
to<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> slide<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
to get it to slide you really have to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
to get it to slide you really have to
sort<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> force<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.500> which<00:01:22.500> means<00:01:22.680> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sort of force it which means just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
sort of force it which means just
letting<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.430> inhibitions<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
letting your inhibitions go and and just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
letting your inhibitions go and and just
letting<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.409> body<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> work<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> front

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
letting your body do the work the front

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
letting your body do the work the front
side<00:01:27.930> tail<00:01:28.140> sides<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.159> your

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
side tail sides you can look at your

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
side tail sides you can look at your
feet<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.119> were<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.600> side

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
feet you can see we were going back side

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
feet you can see we were going back side
to<00:01:30.960> side<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> trust<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.009> body

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to side you got to trust in your body

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
to side you got to trust in your body
that<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> sliding<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that you're just going to be sliding and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.429 
that you're just going to be sliding and
moving<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> once<00:01:36.840> you're<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> trick

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
moving so once you're in to the trick

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
moving so once you're in to the trick
your<00:01:37.890> actual<00:01:38.520> view<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.119> board<00:01:39.390> should

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
your actual view of your board should

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
your actual view of your board should
probably<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.320> something<00:01:40.850> similar<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
probably be something similar to this

real<00:01:56.460> hard<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> good<00:01:57.240> stand-up<00:01:57.810> slide

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
real hard to get a good stand-up slide

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
real hard to get a good stand-up slide
and<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> keep<00:01:58.619> yourself<00:01:59.070> from<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.119> all

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
this and I tend to find that if you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.339 
this and I tend to find that if you
grapple<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.450> board<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:13.020> once

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
grapple the board a little bit once

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it through a little bit so right when

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.740 
it through a little bit so right when
you<00:02:17.100> ollie<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.880> your<00:02:18.000> foots<00:02:18.210> over<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.630> it

through you can see my foot kind of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.780 
through you can see my foot kind of
concave<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:22.710> when<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.400> foots<00:02:23.610> off
