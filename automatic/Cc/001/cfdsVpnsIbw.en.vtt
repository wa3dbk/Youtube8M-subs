 hi friends since previous videos 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 Top 10 largest animals collected 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.290
 many likes decided to do for you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.790
 second part well let's get down to it 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.020
 sarkozuh is an extinct genus of giant 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.920
 crocodiles 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.689
 ate fish and herbivorous dinosaurs 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.850
 dwelt in modern africa 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 110 million years ago 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.330
 the length of the skull was about 180 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 centimeters it means that in his mouth 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 no problem could only ordinary man 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.380
 sarkozuh was about twice 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.649
 longer than modern crocodiles 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.170
 its length reached 12 meters and weight 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 six and a half tons to recent 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 time all the finds are exhausting with 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.989
 few petrified teeth and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 armor shields 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.969
 which were discovered in the desert of sugar

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 years 6 new ones were discovered 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 instances including a dance 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.909
 about half of the skeleton and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 most of the spine are all others 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.740
 giant crocodiles are known only by 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 several fragmentary skulls so 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.439
 the size of the largest crocodile exactly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.759
 giant pantora reached to eight meters 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 its weight was about two tons 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.030
 had a classic bird's beak not 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.460
 who had teeth for his forelimbs 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.830
 presumably and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.110
 or plumage today he 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.100

 fossil brand grief and discovered 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.409
 in 1972 great britain this scorpion 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.830
 was one of the most ancient arachnids 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.950
 but exceeded in size all modern 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.590
 types of length reached 94 centimeters 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.170
 mass unfortunately at the moment is not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 the sink chamber c race reached length 9 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.470
 10 meters that is together with tentacles 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 this clam should have a length of 12 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.130
 meters judging by his size he was 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.590
 top predator

 teeth, although these teeth are very large 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.920
 had some similarities with teeth 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.130
 people but reason why among polenta 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.600
 canopies there was a hypothesis about giant 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.950
 human ancestors 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.880
 the find of the whole jaw of Gigantopitka 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.910
 1956 convincingly proved that she

 small great ape by 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.130
 giant experts estimate drinking these 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.230
 had a height of up to three or even four meters 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.750
 and weighed up to half a ton 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.020
 that is, were the largest monkeys 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.120
 of all times however these estimates cannot 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.420
 be considered final because 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.220
 based on a very small amount 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.920
 fossilized finds and were computed on 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.700
 the basis of the proportions inherent in the structure

 a million years ago these extinct rodents 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.130
 the buffalo sized ones were one and a half 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.950
 meters tall 3 meters long and weighed 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.920
 about two tons of these animals occupied in

 flying birds in the whole history of the earth 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.540
 wingspan was estimated to be up to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 seven and a half meters is twice as much 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.620

 his skull reportedly has about 3 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.360
