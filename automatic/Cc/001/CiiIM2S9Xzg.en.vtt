00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.279
 and closes again 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 this is the first 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 can say 1 more which works 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.020
 more expensive prices will be subsequent but 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.770
 today I will explain to you how is it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.260
 working I will not do with you 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.719
 but I'll explain everything clearly and you already 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.500
 you can see the first two parts 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.840
 hours at 3 and do so let's 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.129
 take and blatantly disassemble the blade to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.129
 finally saw the mechanism 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.600
 as we see we all have such a kombi 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 shock, see what form 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.009
 he is such an interesting form 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 for and raisin thread we take on the rope 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:45.700
 We have here is such a little thing it 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.479
 hooked and twists on when 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.009
 got wet 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 gum back it back click 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.530
 further to fully understand and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.540
 so now he wants to wait so long and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:31.190
 have requested 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:33.680
 look we have the most ordinary 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.160
 mechanism you can see how it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.380
 do here 1 part 2 part 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.170
 can go see and so we 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.750
 do in this drive as spoke in 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.810
 past video we have no disk main 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.440
 the key and we are doing this 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:01.550
 we cut through the gap quite long 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.620
 climbed and so we charge and make marks 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.730
 where the spray begins with the process begins 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.710
 right here and the project happened here 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.980
 I start to move where we look 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.580
 ended it ended right here 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.890
 it means the length we find the middle 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.870
 this place in this segment, and it is 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 there will be a diameter 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.020
 I want the county that is the diameter of the circle will be 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.230
 such 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:35.610
 cut from the top plate which 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.810
 closes a circle like this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:43.140
 we do chasing on this others we must 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.440
 here to stick such two happiness we 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.120
 Must cut two such parts of the EU 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.570
 also plywood should cut and them under 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.790
 by the corner 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:00.960
 to make the river inside the circle 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.190
 such that the thread does not fly off further 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.040
 We begin to build our design 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.750
 we put there already ready so here's the hook and 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.810
 glue attacking here 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.000
 little-little roundellar it was she 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.010
 don't cling here that is see 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.370
 we insert this rounds 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.560
 and it should be located like this 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.130
 That is, the petals should be on 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.540
 the sides and perpendicular should 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.540
 be located this roundel further we twist 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.760
 opens twisted closes it 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:44.400
 going on what is this rounder offended 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:49.280
 cut and move mechanism 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.949
 here is such a mechanism so interesting 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.180
 Further that matters further we take thread 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.460
 it is advisable to buy from under her take here 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.169
 a pen 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.090
 I cut a small piece of small 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.759
 a piece and dress in no prickly 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.289
 you cannot tie a knot you need a knot will 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.320
 be sure to slide off you 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.930
 such is the flat part that she was 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.110
 even she will be very good 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.590
 engage here here you 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.590
 kisses 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:34.510
 here it will be and completely scroll 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:39.070
 there we pull a string she makes a circle 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:43.520
 this part goes to and here and 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.170
 gum then jerks back everything gets up 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.020
 to their seats why do you need to 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:54.910
 lubricate and these parts 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.910
 must grip with lube 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.460
 then everything will open much 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.470
 more smoothly and easier and start to collect 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.050
 on must find the distance at which 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:11.810
 gum will be stretched and at the same time 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:14.330
 will catch on where is the full 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.440
 circle here you need to cut to not 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.440
 slid off nothing 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.090
 so far we do that's why I collect 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.580
 such a construction further we must 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.440
 cut just such a rack in it 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.960
 hole 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.080
 more precisely not holes kick the circle and him 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.350
 stick here 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.910
 closing and now our disk will be 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.620
 just stick honestly need to glue 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.490
 on superglue or something else 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.080
 this is after which all gathered can wear 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.080
 on hand and test 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.220
 about the rate I disassembled it showed work 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.400
 it became why a little bit similar and due 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:08.420
 depends but bogside it here we have 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.930
 it opens and closes like everything 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.550
 It works well, I thought about Anke see 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:17.750
 here here is twitching 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.560
 she spins opens the blade further 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.270
 goes back 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:29.260
 drank up back hooked again and blade 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:33.380
 retracts again click goes back again 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:36.020
 hooked people and so here is all 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.620
 It works well I think you liked it 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.680
 this video support him like i want 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:45.620
 in many likes you so much want 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.900
 seriously complicated it was I make you 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.360
 showed hope you will succeed but 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.690
 that's all and do not know subscribe to 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:59.560
 channel put your thumbs up to 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.560
 and all, I wish you all good luck
