done on it thankfully all that kind of
stuff<00:00:27.199> running<00:00:28.199> e85<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.429> uh<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:30.269> currently

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
stuff running e85 so uh I'm currently

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.560 
stuff running e85 so uh I'm currently
have<00:00:30.749> my<00:00:30.899> wideband<00:00:31.349> at<00:00:31.559> lambda<00:00:32.269> that<00:00:33.269> can<00:00:33.449> be

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
have my wideband at lambda that can be

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.329 
have my wideband at lambda that can be
either<00:00:33.949> gas<00:00:34.949> or<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.670> 85<00:00:36.179> it<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:37.309> 1.0<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
either gas or an 85 it just 1.0 is

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.400 
either gas or an 85 it just 1.0 is
stoichiometry<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.839> is<00:00:39.929> where<00:00:40.109> you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stoichiometry which is where you want to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.419 
stoichiometry which is where you want to
be<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.679> for<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.579> you're<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.969> boost

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
be at for when you're not in boost

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.410 
be at for when you're not in boost
alright<00:00:44.429> let<00:00:44.579> me<00:00:44.609> get<00:00:44.760> over<00:00:44.820> here

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
alright let me get over here

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.959 
alright let me get over here
I<00:00:46.249> can't<00:00:47.249> really<00:00:47.370> sit<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.850> doubling<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:49.140> here

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
I can't really sit up doubling up here

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
I can't really sit up doubling up here
alright<00:00:51.409> so<00:00:52.409> once<00:00:53.010> you're<00:00:53.159> connected<00:00:54.559> y'all

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
alright so once you're connected y'all

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
alright so once you're connected y'all
you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> option<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> follow<00:00:57.179> me<00:00:57.480> which

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you have the option to follow me which

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
you have the option to follow me which
make<00:00:58.289> whole<00:00:58.499> bunch<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.949> yellow<00:00:59.129> cells

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
make whole bunch of little yellow cells

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.119 
make whole bunch of little yellow cells
right<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.949> then<00:01:01.949> if

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
you want to erase the tail and erase all

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.179 
you want to erase the tail and erase all
the<00:01:03.929> yellow<00:01:04.110> ones<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.379> tell<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.890> you're

press on it tells you all the places you
hit<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> map<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:12.090> erase<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.380> some

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
hit in the map so I erase it and do some

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
hit in the map so I erase it and do some
tuning<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.390> I'm<00:01:15.390> only<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.840> some

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
tuning right now I'm only gonna do some

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.550 
tuning right now I'm only gonna do some
vacuum<00:01:16.380> tuning<00:01:17.810> there's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> plus<00:01:19.079> and<00:01:19.259> minus

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
vacuum tuning there's a plus and minus

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.810 
vacuum tuning there's a plus and minus
add<00:01:19.740> fuel<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.990> plus<00:01:21.990> minus<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.820> down

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
add fuel right here plus minus and down

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
add fuel right here plus minus and down
here<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.170> adjust<00:01:25.500> percentage<00:01:25.979> which

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here it has the adjust percentage which

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
here it has the adjust percentage which
I<00:01:26.399> have<00:01:26.549> set<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.210> little<00:01:28.079> box<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.500> can

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I have set to one little box you can

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.529 
I have set to one little box you can
change<00:01:28.799> anything<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.399> 7-10<00:01:29.939> whatever<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
change anything from 7-10 whatever you

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.810 
change anything from 7-10 whatever you
want<00:01:30.689> percent<00:01:31.280> depending<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
want percent depending which how you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.219 
want percent depending which how you
want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.390> already<00:01:33.509> fine-tuning<00:01:34.140> my

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
want to now I'm already fine-tuning my

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630 
want to now I'm already fine-tuning my
vacuum<00:01:34.500> zone<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.009> at<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.219> percent<00:01:35.490> though

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
vacuum zone but at one percent though

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
vacuum zone but at one percent though
I'm<00:01:35.789> not<00:01:35.880> adjusting<00:01:36.360> too<00:01:36.539> crazy<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.049> jumping

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I'm not adjusting too crazy and jumping

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.730 
I'm not adjusting too crazy and jumping
all<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.649> place<00:01:39.170> alright<00:01:40.170> let's<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.530> some

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
all over the place alright let's do some

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.910 
all over the place alright let's do some
tuning<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.149> gonna<00:01:42.289> have<00:01:43.289> it<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.469> neutral

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
tuning I'm just gonna have it in neutral

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.760 
tuning I'm just gonna have it in neutral
and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.610 

see<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.729> rich<00:01:49.670> the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
see where that's at rich the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:20.680 
see where that's at rich the
oh<00:01:51.650> there<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.400> go

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:03:03.680 

like<00:02:21.380> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.930 

so<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:05.050> tuned<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:06.160> whole<00:03:06.400> range<00:03:06.730> from

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
so I just tuned that whole range from

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.250 
so I just tuned that whole range from
the<00:03:07.060> top<00:03:07.360> vacuum<00:03:08.550> at<00:03:09.550> their<00:03:09.790> 6000<00:03:10.630> rpm<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.140> can

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
the top vacuum at their 6000 rpm you can

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.430 
the top vacuum at their 6000 rpm you can
see<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:12.360> got<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.390> where<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> wanted<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.230> in

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
see I got it where I wanted to be in

see I got it where I wanted to be in
there<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:14.830> your<00:03:15.010> tuning<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.550> depending

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
there all your tuning is are depending

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.590 
there all your tuning is are depending
on<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.300> I've<00:03:16.510> guess<00:03:18.060> write<00:03:19.060> up<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.300> lot<00:03:19.420> about

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
on you I've guess write up a lot about

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.950 
on you I've guess write up a lot about
tuning<00:03:20.050> about<00:03:20.650> your<00:03:20.800> lambda<00:03:21.570> vacuum<00:03:22.570> usually

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
tuning about your lambda vacuum usually

may<00:03:25.030> be<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> little<00:03:25.240> bit<00:03:25.390> church<00:03:25.600> for<00:03:25.930> cooling

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
may be a little bit church for cooling

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.270 
may be a little bit church for cooling
properties<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:26.770> I'm<00:03:26.830> running<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.070> little<00:03:27.160> bit

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
properties but I'm running a little bit

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.900 
properties but I'm running a little bit
85<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:27.970> pretty<00:03:28.900> good<00:03:29.020> cooling<00:03:29.200> properties<00:03:29.910> so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
85 so pretty good cooling properties so

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.950 
85 so pretty good cooling properties so
that's<00:03:31.060> pretty<00:03:31.180> much<00:03:31.270> how<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.480> tune<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.810> just

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
that's pretty much how you tune you just

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.140 
that's pretty much how you tune you just
have<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.140> go<00:03:32.230> around<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.500> whole<00:03:32.880> rpm<00:03:33.880> range

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
have to go around the whole rpm range

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.870 
have to go around the whole rpm range
and<00:03:34.780> usually<00:03:35.710> that<00:03:36.040> lets<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.400> can<00:03:36.550> tune<00:03:36.700> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and usually that lets I can tune the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.610 
and usually that lets I can tune the
whole<00:03:37.000> negative<00:03:37.450> twenty<00:03:37.780> vacuum<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
whole negative twenty vacuum but if you

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.920 
whole negative twenty vacuum but if you
want<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.860> tune<00:03:39.010> all<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.460> ones<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.510> between<00:03:40.630> up

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
want to tune all the ones in between up

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.510 
want to tune all the ones in between up
to<00:03:41.050> zero<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.590> kind<00:03:41.770> of<00:03:41.800> want<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> take<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.460> a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
to zero you kind of want to take it on a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.280 
to zero you kind of want to take it on a
cruise<00:03:43.710> follow<00:03:44.710> me<00:03:45.010> drive<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.900> at<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.990> certain

is a vacuum meter to look when I'm

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.200 
is a vacuum meter to look when I'm
driving<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.090> you'll<00:03:52.630> see<00:03:54.030> where<00:03:55.030> you're<00:03:55.180> out

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
driving and you'll see where you're out

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.820 
driving and you'll see where you're out
in<00:03:55.360> AFR<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.930> then<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.140> kind<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.350> just<00:03:56.470> tune<00:03:56.680> as

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
in AFR and then you kind of just tune as

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.520 
in AFR and then you kind of just tune as
you're<00:03:56.980> driving<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.670> keep<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.970> steady<00:03:58.030> foot

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
you're driving just keep a steady foot

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.230 
you're driving just keep a steady foot
steady<00:03:59.530> rpm<00:03:59.980> see<00:04:00.250> what<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.490> is<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.610> state<00:04:01.000> the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
steady rpm see what it is a state the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.400 
steady rpm see what it is a state the
wideband<00:04:01.570> will<00:04:01.750> stay<00:04:01.900> there<00:04:01.960> and<00:04:02.110> then<00:04:02.290> you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
wideband will stay there and then you

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.780 
wideband will stay there and then you
adjust<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.770> till<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.040> want<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.550> want<00:04:03.700> it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
range and then how you tune the vacuum

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.390 
range and then how you tune the vacuum
faster<00:04:11.290> way<00:04:11.380> would<00:04:11.500> be<00:04:11.530> on<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.740> dyno<00:04:11.950> tune<00:04:12.220> which

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
faster way would be on a dyno tune which

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.560

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
make sure bring a video that but for now

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.170 
make sure bring a video that but for now
that's<00:04:15.610> vacuum<00:04:16.060> tuning<00:04:16.390> I'll<00:04:16.480> map<00:04:16.690> ECU
