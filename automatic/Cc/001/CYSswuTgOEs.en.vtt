00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.259
 and recommendations for patients the 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.779
 fixed prosthesis 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.240
 The fixed prosthesis is an element that 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 replenishes part or all of one or 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.369
 several teeth permanently 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.710
 requires synchronized work between 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.050
 the dentist and the prosthetist so 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.330
 often need numerous appointments have 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.810
 patience once made the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.029
 prosthesis and cemented 1 avoid chewing 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.949
 food too hard to bite 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.020
 nails or any other type of element 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.239
 harmful because many crowns or 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.760
 bridges are covered with a layer of 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.710
 porcelain that can be damaged when the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.690
 porcelain fracture the solution 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.149
 permanent involves removing the crown or 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.420
 the bridge in its entirety and replace it 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.370
 for another new 2 if you have veneers 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.549
 porcelain avoid prying or 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.100
 tear with them 3 avoid drinking 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.809
 directly from the bottle and protect yourself 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.670
 if you do it in crowded places 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.889
 because a glass impact in the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.069
 porcelain could produce a fracture 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:05.710
 unexpected in the anterior teeth 4 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.450
 If your crown or bridge comes off 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.400
 possible with time go 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.440
 immediately to your dentist so that 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.260
 study the causes and get it from 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.300
 new 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.430
 because a delay can cause the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.800
 space, preventing repositioning 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.890
 of said bridge or the appearance of 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.350
 infections or other types of problems 5 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.510
 If your crown or bridge has been dyed or if 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.610
 want to change aesthetics ask for appointment with 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.400
 your dentist to receive advice 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.580
 also to maximize the life of 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.040
 your prosthesis know that one the plan of 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.080
 periodic reviews is important already 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.500
 that teeth with crowns and bridges are 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.900
 they face greater 32 the delay in the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.790
 diagnosis often involves 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.030
 total loss of the tooth treated with 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.830
 prosthesis 3 the use of a dental splint 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.650
 It will relieve the stress of the teeth and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.229
 muscles your dentist could inform you 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.060
 in more detail keep a good 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.920
 hygiene to avoid gingivitis and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 Periodontitis that can cause 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 mobility and bleeding problems and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.149
 for that 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.850
 cps daily from the gum to the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.870
 use mouthwash as a complement to the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 dental floss since prostheses tend to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.980
 to retain food remains and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.660
 bacteria from their union with the tooth or in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.420
 the root that supports it 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.150
