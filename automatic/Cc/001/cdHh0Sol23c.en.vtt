00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
championship and then moving

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.440 
championship and then moving
well<00:01:36.020> level<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.490> gives<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.970> sort<00:01:38.360> of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
well level it just gives you sort of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.990 
well level it just gives you sort of
this<00:01:38.630> immense<00:01:39.170> feeling<00:01:39.799> inside<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
this immense feeling inside of you you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.179 
this immense feeling inside of you you
