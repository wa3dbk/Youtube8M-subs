some people don't succeed is is
commitment<00:00:13.580> I<00:00:14.230> mean<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:15.259> think<00:00:15.349> that's<00:00:15.589> clear

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
commitment I mean I think that's clear

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.909 
commitment I mean I think that's clear
many<00:00:17.539> people<00:00:17.900> simply<00:00:18.199> are<00:00:18.470> not<00:00:18.680> committed<00:00:19.279> and

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
many people simply are not committed and

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.880 
many people simply are not committed and
any<00:00:21.919> doing<00:00:22.369> anything<00:00:22.759> that's<00:00:23.650> succeeding<00:00:24.650> at

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
any doing anything that's succeeding at

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.179 
any doing anything that's succeeding at
doing<00:00:25.310> anything<00:00:25.669> that's<00:00:26.329> challenging<00:00:27.050> is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.890 

requires<00:00:31.189> a<00:00:31.669> high<00:00:32.239> level<00:00:32.480> of<00:00:32.660> commitment

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
requires a high level of commitment

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.960 
requires a high level of commitment
because<00:00:33.320> when<00:00:33.890> someone's<00:00:34.370> not<00:00:34.430> commit

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
because when someone's not commit

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.720 
because when someone's not commit
committed<00:00:35.540> as<00:00:35.720> soon<00:00:35.870> as<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.110> gets<00:00:36.199> difficult

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
committed as soon as it gets difficult

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.350 
committed as soon as it gets difficult
they<00:00:37.730> give<00:00:37.879> up<00:00:38.030> they<00:00:38.269> go<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.449> something<00:00:38.720> else

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
they give up they go to something else

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.270 
they give up they go to something else
they<00:00:41.360> give<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.079> I<00:00:42.170> think<00:00:42.440> one<00:00:42.650> of<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.860> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
they give in and I think one of the the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.630 
they give in and I think one of the the
other<00:00:43.399> piece<00:00:43.699> that's<00:00:44.539> probably<00:00:45.460> equally<00:00:46.460> as

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
other piece that's probably equally as

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.319 
other piece that's probably equally as
important<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.140> many<00:00:48.379> people<00:00:48.800> simply

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
important is that many people simply

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.709 
important is that many people simply
haven't<00:00:50.329> done<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.809> work<00:00:51.520> on<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:53.300> emotional

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
haven't done the work on the emotional

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.240 
haven't done the work on the emotional
side<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:56.079> believe<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> majority<00:00:58.010> of

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
side so I believe that the majority of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.090 
side so I believe that the majority of
calories<00:00:59.090> eaten<00:00:59.660> in<00:00:59.870> our<00:01:00.019> culture<00:01:00.500> today<00:01:00.710> are

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
calories eaten in our culture today are

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.970 
calories eaten in our culture today are
eaten<00:01:01.370> for<00:01:01.579> emotional<00:01:02.000> reasons<00:01:02.859> so<00:01:03.859> if

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
eaten for emotional reasons so if

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.499 
eaten for emotional reasons so if
someone<00:01:04.280> hasn't<00:01:04.460> done<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.879> work<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.390> they

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
someone hasn't done the work that they

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.960 
someone hasn't done the work that they
need<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.750> do<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.289> deep<00:01:07.039> be<00:01:07.220> able<00:01:07.399> to<00:01:07.460> deal<00:01:07.729> with

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
need to do to deep be able to deal with

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.240 
need to do to deep be able to deal with
their<00:01:08.149> emotions<00:01:08.750> on<00:01:08.929> an<00:01:09.050> ongoing<00:01:09.259> basis<00:01:10.070> as

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
their emotions on an ongoing basis as

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.400 
their emotions on an ongoing basis as
they<00:01:10.429> come<00:01:10.700> up<00:01:10.729> they're<00:01:11.690> gonna<00:01:11.840> likely<00:01:12.289> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
they come up they're gonna likely to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.400 
they come up they're gonna likely to
find<00:01:12.590> themselves<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.479> same<00:01:14.690> pattern<00:01:15.080> of

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
find themselves in the same pattern of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.779 
find themselves in the same pattern of
eating<00:01:16.250> emotionally<00:01:18.429> when<00:01:19.429> those<00:01:19.640> things

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
eating emotionally when those things

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.430 
eating emotionally when those things
come<00:01:19.940> up<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.450> know<00:01:20.599> eating<00:01:20.869> eating<00:01:21.259> to

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
come up you know eating eating to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.960 
come up you know eating eating to
suppress<00:01:21.830> those<00:01:22.039> emotions<00:01:22.580> they're<00:01:22.819> not

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
suppress those emotions they're not

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.820 
suppress those emotions they're not
doing<00:01:23.209> it<00:01:23.300> on<00:01:23.360> purpose<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:24.319> not<00:01:24.410> a<00:01:24.500> conscious

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
doing it on purpose it's not a conscious

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.169 
doing it on purpose it's not a conscious
choice<00:01:25.539> but<00:01:26.539> it's<00:01:26.690> their<00:01:26.959> ingrained<00:01:28.179> habit

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
choice but it's their ingrained habit

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.300 
choice but it's their ingrained habit
it's<00:01:29.869> their<00:01:30.110> pattern<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.709> their<00:01:30.800> programming

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it's their pattern and their programming

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.969 
it's their pattern and their programming
and<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.119> because<00:01:32.959> they<00:01:33.110> haven't<00:01:33.349> changed<00:01:33.649> it

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
and so because they haven't changed it

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.070 
and so because they haven't changed it
and<00:01:34.610> they<00:01:34.789> haven't<00:01:35.119> done<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.450> work<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.660> be

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
and they haven't done the work to be

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.190 
and they haven't done the work to be
able<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:37.130> deal<00:01:37.580> with<00:01:37.789> those<00:01:37.940> emotions<00:01:38.200> instead

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
able to deal with those emotions instead

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.410 
able to deal with those emotions instead
of<00:01:39.440> suppressing<00:01:39.860> them<00:01:40.190> they<00:01:40.759> go<00:01:40.940> back<00:01:41.179> into

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
of suppressing them they go back into

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.690 
of suppressing them they go back into
their<00:01:41.660> normal<00:01:42.440> pattern<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.830> suppressing<00:01:43.580> them

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
their normal pattern of suppressing them

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.620 
their normal pattern of suppressing them
clearly<00:01:45.009> people<00:01:46.009> do<00:01:46.399> succeed<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.479> it's

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
clearly people do succeed so it's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.930 
clearly people do succeed so it's
possible<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.830> know<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.220> possible<00:01:49.789> for

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
possible you know it's possible for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.359 
possible you know it's possible for
anybody<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.660> really<00:01:50.840> wants<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.349> so<00:01:52.250> if

to make only the best choices from now
on<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:57.080> can<00:01:57.259> do<00:01:57.379> that<00:01:57.640> even<00:01:58.640> if<00:01:58.729> it's

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
on you can you can do that even if it's

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.969 
on you can you can do that even if it's
been<00:01:59.060> hard<00:01:59.270> up<00:01:59.390> until<00:01:59.690> now<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.080> would<00:02:00.560> encourage

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.099 
out that I'm not suggesting that you be
committed<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:19.129> particular<00:02:19.730> diet<00:02:19.969> or<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
committed to a particular diet or to

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.170 
committed to a particular diet or to
particular<00:02:21.500> lifestyle<00:02:21.950> choices<00:02:22.189> you<00:02:22.819> can<00:02:22.969> do

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
particular lifestyle choices you can do

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.070 
particular lifestyle choices you can do
that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.320 
that
but<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:25.070> what's<00:02:25.280> much<00:02:25.550> more<00:02:25.580> important

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
but I think what's much more important

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.500 
but I think what's much more important
is<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:28.280> committed<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> something<00:02:28.910> larger

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
is to be committed to something larger

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.330 
is to be committed to something larger
than<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.140> okay

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
than that okay

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.270 
than that okay
I<00:02:31.370> mean<00:02:32.380> committing<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> particular<00:02:34.040> diet

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
I mean committing to a particular diet

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.490 
I mean committing to a particular diet
you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.240> imagine<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.960> was<00:02:36.110> something

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
you know imagine it was something

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.400 
you know imagine it was something
different<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:37.010> I'm<00:02:37.310> committed<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.880> eating

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
different like I'm committed to eating

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.100 
different like I'm committed to eating
pizza<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.440> french<00:02:39.920> fries<00:02:40.190> every<00:02:40.430> day<00:02:41.110> why

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
pizza and french fries every day why

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.080 
pizza and french fries every day why
would<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.350> commit<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.640> even<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.000> you

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
would you commit to that I'm even if you

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
would you commit to that I'm even if you
really<00:02:44.270> love<00:02:44.450> those<00:02:44.630> things<00:02:44.870> well<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.770> know

really love those things well you know

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.440 
really love those things well you know
it's<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.340> don't<00:02:46.400> need<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.700> commit<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.150> diet

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it's you don't need to commit to a diet

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.690 
it's you don't need to commit to a diet
