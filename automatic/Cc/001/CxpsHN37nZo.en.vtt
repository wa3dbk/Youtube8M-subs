00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.910
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today I 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.580
 I will tell you about how to plant 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.789
 currants probably you all know what 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.609
 currants are black red white 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.650
 golden so -called in principle all 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.420
 they are similar in progress but nevertheless 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 what features shall we say black 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.769
 currants she is more demanding 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.869
 soil moisture fertility red and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.580
 golden in principle is beautiful 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.760
 tolerates dry air and fine 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.350
 suffer drought 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.240
 black currants are much more rich in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 ascorbic acid but in red 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.890
 currant contains a large number 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 biologically active substances which 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 5 or even 10 times faster output from 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
 human body some toxins 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.100
 radioactive substances 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 Well, white currant is useful to those people 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 who are allergic to just 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 does not cause allergies but nonetheless 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.040
 An example of this red bush here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.170
 currants we will see how you need 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.689
 right to plant it well, I always advise 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.399
 buy container plants why in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289
 First you immediately see what you are buying. 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.340
 here they are fruit 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.560
 despite the fact that the plant in the container 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.119
 gets well no matter how full the food 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 nevertheless the fruit and tied and here 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.950
 see what they will be in the second root 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
 plant system is beautiful 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 formed you can plant it in any 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.880
 time in spring and summer and autumn well 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 of course except for the frosty winter 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 the roots will not be damaged by disease 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.909
 disease your plants will be no 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 stress accordingly but not experienced and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 so when planting any type of currant 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.549
 first thing to do 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.719
 dig a plot of land where you 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.729
 going to plant and 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.619
 and get rid of absolutely all weeds 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 especially those that are deeply rooted 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.969
 it is better to choose landing sites 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.889
 lighted 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.270
 protected from cold winds where 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.729
 some water will be so good 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
 hold a pit rummages about 40 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 centimeters deep and 60 centimeters 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.850
 width since the currant plants here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.829
 fructifying to get 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.909
 good harvest naturally required 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.829
 good land so most i am we 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.410
 about three-quarters we fill 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.940
 a mixture of compost humus 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.100
 sod land you can add mineral 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.510
 fertilizer in small quantity if you 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.010
 added mineral fertilizer have 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.740
 in view of not burning the roots 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 need to cover this layer a little bit 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.880
 common ground now we take out 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.650
 neatly from the container of our bush 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.450
 from secret to the bottom is clearly a little 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.860
 we press down to the root neck here 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.960
 roots here by the way how to become 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.510
 stick out a little out there 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.530
 put so that the root neck was 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.420
 at ground level 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.080
 and now the remaining space 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 we fall asleep our good fertile land 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.560
 when you fall asleep don't forget 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.750
 tamp with our hands so that we go there 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.640
 the earth is gone and to remember all 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.670
 voids when you tamped done 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.200
 Immediately such a trunk circle 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.960
 have made sure that some water is not 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.610
 flowed to her pour pouring can 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.620
 copiously can be directly on the foliage pouring 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.690
 currants by the way everything is absolutely and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.940
 white and red and black all love 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.740
 sprinkling dry period is useful for them 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.620
 dash do this watering not only 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.150
 charges moisture to the root system but still 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.400
 and contributes to the fact that the land is about 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.170
 penetrates inside and the voids that are there 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 Of course, they were probably here 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.950
 are floating in the ground and root system 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 we got it out of the container 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.030
 will be surrounded on all sides 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 earth and the plant will live beautifully and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.170
 to develop means then some water 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.390
 imbibed fucked two or three times well 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.590
 spilled some water soaked now upper 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.390
 layer necessarily need 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.130
 grumble we took the mixture from us 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.200
 such a peat for a little bit of nail files here 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.850
 added a good loose mulch which 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.870
 It will be very good to retain moisture in 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.900
 this pristvolnye circles 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.430
 another plus mulching will not be 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.320
 grow at least some time 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.000
 here weeds repeat where the currant 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.950
 it is very important not to be here 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.890
 no weeds to pick up 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.600
 nutrients well basically here 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.160
 this plant that you planted can 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.170
 quietly leave until spring 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.810
 don't do anything with it in general 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.989
 it is necessary when spring comes the first thing 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.090
 need to do this carefully loosen 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.519
 here it is here this pinhole 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.950
 circle remove all weeds naturally 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.290
 loosen up to get there 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.269
 and moisture and air and in order for the earth 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.670
 was loose here is a very important stage 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.769
 next in currants care this 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.989
 annual pruning the fact is that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.000
 Currant pruning gives a lot 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.070
 shoots from every year you need 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.410
 leave 34 escapes 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.920
 and such molding to produce for 5 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.340
 years and here at 5 for 6 year you will have 15 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.230
 17 shoots of different ages 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.720
 the yield depends on it because 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.280
 that yields start rising a 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.870
 then begins quietly over the years 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.370
 disappear and here these branches need 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.860
 constantly exchanging then there must be 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.800
 branches of different ages feed 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.450
 currant and red and white and black 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.180
 preferably in the fall in Nastya and this one 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.580
 tree trunk compost or humus i 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.440
 supporter of organic fertilizers but if 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.060
 you want can spring fertilize 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.400
 mineral fertilizer naturally 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.570
 combined with such abundant watering 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.490
 if you apply mineral fertilizer 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.500
 you need to water the soil very well 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.270
 use foliar top dressing then 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.950
 have sprayed leaves special 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.810
 means for this but it already depends on 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.580
 fertility of your soil so to speak 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.300
 how much have you contributed to root 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.240
 the system 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.180
 Well, I remind you that the most important thing is this 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.980
 tree trunk around your bush 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.120
 currants must be clean 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.120
 and free from weeds 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.819
 that's all I wanted for you 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.949
 today talk about how to 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.020
 plant currants how to care for them 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.210
 at least the first time on this i'm with 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.919
