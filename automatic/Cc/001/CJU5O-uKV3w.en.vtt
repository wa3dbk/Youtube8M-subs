00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.110 
very simple to add on the series up
lights<00:04:48.310> then<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.990> signal<00:04:50.470> clip<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.729> just<00:04:51.940> use

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
lights then for signal clip you just use

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.159 
lights then for signal clip you just use
DMX<00:04:52.570> cables<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.830> these<00:04:53.979> have<00:04:54.250> DMX<00:04:54.820> in

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
DMX cables that's it these have DMX in

DMX cables that's it these have DMX in
DMX<00:04:56.169> out<00:04:56.349> you<00:04:57.250> plug<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.000> same<00:04:58.479> thing

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
DMX out you plug it in and same thing

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.240 
DMX out you plug it in and same thing
with<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.870> power<00:04:59.020> cable<00:04:59.470> they're<00:04:59.830> going<00:05:00.070> from

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
with the power cable they're going from

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.029 
with the power cable they're going from
one<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.729> next<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.270> next<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.770> light

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
one to the next to the next so the light

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.490 
one to the next to the next so the light
number<00:05:03.250> one<00:05:03.580> if<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.389> want<00:05:04.539> this<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.840> be<00:05:04.960> purple
