00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hi, welcome to the most ex 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.600
 Valentines day at this time that help us 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 and let's finalize then this little 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.380
 project we created a video store 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 earlier we talked about the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.320
 form right law that have movies and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.470
 such 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 and here shows the price will be cloudy or 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.039
 to see that places more things more 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.910
 agility to make people grow 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609
 on top 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.830
 the user name is not so for example 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 put here at max wilson because he 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.920
 want to make a vocation is this case and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:38.730
 dictate a date here but I can put 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 another date for example of good there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.879
 then on that date the code of that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.320
 lease and then ok the customer data 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 I trust he will put for example 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.039
 will be loka abatac beauty with more movies 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 and if you ever wish some movie can 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 click here 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 generated a new field to put the troop of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.890
 elite in this case then beauty is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 What he's going to put could also 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 create date for evolution and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.400
 everything else is not right 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 but in this case here if I have to create 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.619
 a new motto that in this case I was 3 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 here because I have the locations that already 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.850
 had moved it so that for example 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.970
 the auction with two films or the fast 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 if I go there on the landmarks is the landmarks too 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 with two children here the elite 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.540
 very easy system there guys interact 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 which is basic knowledge in akz is at 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 Wait there, it was useful for you. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.229
 learn now to finish let's go then 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 creating a menu with fear here is fine 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.840
 simple 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 For this I will have to customize the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.520
 my toolbar in the field here 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.290
 O 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.570
 I was there, armored nurse, just to 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.160
 give this space here I could put 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.940
 new guides we will leave this for 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.860
 While 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.470
 I'll just put it here and click the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.890
 right click here and this will appear 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 option 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.980
 calls customize bar 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.310
 quick access touch tools 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.440
 click here and up there is I have 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.270
 these options here to save undo and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.660
 remake here in the corner here so I 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.120
 I can add any command together 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.140
 with them there for example you can put the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:43.830
 open a very simple ok appeared open 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.700
 there and click I can choose what I 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.830
 I want to open 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.780
 is the same process click on the file 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.730
 Apr is the same guy, but he's good but 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.170
 I want to do is actually create a 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 menu then I'll pick an option that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.080
 is not showing up there is this guy who 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.900
 I think he walks well here leaves 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.250
 search for out-of- game commands here 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.170
 Rain options 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.550
 here's what I want and have commands 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.070
 out of the game options I have this 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.140
 face called reboot manager 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.739
 I was scared and told to add and I'm going to give 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.329
 An okay beauty, too, in case I want 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.120
 remove any of them could 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.560
 wrap the open ne right teaching button 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.900
 remove but I want to tweak the menu then 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.890
 I was with him this message that I do not 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.739
 I create any for now the name of 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.380
 The standard for me is the edict that I can 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:53.510
 change the name I want to leave only the 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.510
 menu for example the forms menu 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.549
 close in beauty 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.000
 ok then you have none in the other 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:11.010
 but I'll edit this one so click 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.269
 edit then here i came here new now i 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.269
 I'm going to give a name that I want then 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.510
 example any work I want marking 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.359
 placement the first want to see the world 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.240
 which has several commands the disregard that I 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.039
 I want to open form for certain 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.190
 he asked what form it was then 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:38.400
 location is the title I gave there I'll give 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:42.090
 a beauty ok again again and now 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:49.130
 with any April break then lets 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:56.789
 I see the client open up for there addition 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:59.120
 form that is close now close 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.080
 again he has created for me that O 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.900
 control menu 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.460
 I'll give you two clicks here 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.650
 Note that he has already created for me with the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.190
 title that I gave the least popular 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.180
 in this case two simple nÃ© you click 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
 on location 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.300
 he opens the lease there you click 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.280
 clients well even then I hope you 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.380
 enjoyed in these tips in art 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.659
 get out but there's more to 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.550
 People are going to start messing with 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.210
 relationships fuller than one 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.430
 advanced way and we'll mess with 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.969
 consultation is in several ways and 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.380
 consultations so here we will work with 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.150
 import and export ltda has 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.820
