 Hello everyone, today we will do one together 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.080
 anti age face cream with quintino aq 10 Ã¨ 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.060
 a very full-bodied cream and is suitable 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.700
 therefore for very dry and 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.609
 ripe this is the recipe as you can 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.289
 see there are only two stages why 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.960
 the phase to phase b are merged into 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.269
 one phase and then there is the phase ci 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.199
 also then I used to sing it 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.089
 in this recipe 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.560
 if you want to use it you can 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:35.380
 then insert 0.3 gram dicana santana 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.740
 don't becker we put water and then 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.990
 all the fat part tivioli butters and le 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.100
 emulsifiers, etc. etc. 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.340
 also if you prefer you can 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 simply proceed with the recipe a 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.940
 three phases 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 nothing changes is just a way with 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.670
 which I find myself better in short 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.880
 put the mixture in a bain - marie than in 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.010
 how it will be dissolved and we find the 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.520
 composed with a milk plane or with 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 minipimer woods 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.330
 once the compound will be 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
 completely and cold 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.040
 we are going to insert reactivates as far as 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.900
 regards the continuous aq 10 I have it in 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.660
 dust then stuff to melt a little 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.460
 of rosehip oil if you do 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.760
 the already liquid, in short, a whole 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.229
 simply without using oil 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.740
 however, more oil does not hurt 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.930
 within this recipe continues 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.940
 to insert all the others chosen e 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.729
 finally as usual I put the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.130
 preservative and I measure the pH it must 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.960
 be around 5 56 our cream 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.600
 anti age is ready as you can see 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.860
 very full bodied but also very pleasant 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.280

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.940
