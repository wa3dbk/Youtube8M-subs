fifty teats lifespan of the possums in
the<00:02:31.300> wild<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.690> about<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.200> three<00:02:32.530> years<00:02:32.790> while

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the wild is about one three years while

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.590 
the wild is about one three years while
in<00:02:34.360> captivity<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.620> be<00:02:35.830> about<00:02:36.640> eight<00:02:37.030> years

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
in captivity it can be about eight years

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.300 
in captivity it can be about eight years
and<00:02:38.190> also<00:02:39.190> hint<00:02:40.150> feed<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.630> possum<00:02:41.100> very<00:02:42.100> much

resemble small human hands and also our

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.300 
resemble small human hands and also our
equipment<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:46.900> dams<00:02:47.560> which<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.400> great<00:02:50.310> in

equipment with dams which are great in
in<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:52.090> he'll<00:02:52.480> basically<00:02:52.990> help<00:02:53.440> them<00:02:53.710> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
in there he'll basically help them to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.310 
in there he'll basically help them to
climb

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
climb

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.060 
climb
I'll<00:02:56.740> suppose<00:02:57.580> summer<00:02:57.970> only<00:02:58.840> hunts<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.830> food

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
I'll suppose summer only hunts for food

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.490 
I'll suppose summer only hunts for food
in<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:01.020> night<00:03:02.020> time<00:03:02.520> while<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:04.060> daytime<00:03:05.050> he

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
in a night time while in a daytime he

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.450 
in a night time while in a daytime he
usually<00:03:06.000> rests<00:03:07.470> usually<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.620> hollow<00:03:08.890> trees<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
usually rests usually in hollow trees to
