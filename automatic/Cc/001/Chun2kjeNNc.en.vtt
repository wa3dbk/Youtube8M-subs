00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:18.300
 Hello, I finished my knife so 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:24.060
 homemade flipper here lining 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:29.250
 titanium turned out the other exo solved 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:39.620
 after processing on a shallow world. will you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:48.570
 chamfer video shot did not repair it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 I wanted to leave so small you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 spilled 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:59.300
 doing a hacksaw doctors were 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.300
 made such a travel stop 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.080
 frame to titanic and daily map 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 neochen spring axial 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:21.380
 falcon all jars are such a peg 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 This turned out to be a new one too. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.990
 what cant still been so window wanted 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.580
 first developed folding too 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.440
 a small distance here turned out 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.340
 this is why it is not so good 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.340
 turned out 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 the brain could mid principle this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.560
 is regulated 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:57.470
 replacing a pin on a larger diameter is 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.970
 signed a big alligator manifestation 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:12.970
 article after 10 under such a stigma will have 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.970
 I have such an experience 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.840
 all the mice on the edge evolve 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.220
 right hand does not work 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.220
 do you require personally 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:48.980
 the beginning of the forms stuck to you after polishing 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 this part of the heel of the blade this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.630
 why was everything great 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.390
 blade poured on cutter without 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:14.709
 so let's say everything to the eye flowed for example 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:22.540
 hardness is not measure should from 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:28.050
 learn and 10 9 50 families of units by 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.050
 leaf is not the essence of the main work on the experience 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:44.040
 designing somewhere I'll already know what 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:44.040
 how to do the only thing 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.390
 difficult is that this knife is not 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:58.620
 lifting and more clifford flip oval so and 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 we have no cleaning plane very hard 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:09.100
 with planes with a fit there is a small 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 easy stretch doesn't even feel on 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.430
 Skoda lifter and some gaps on 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.390
 washers washer ish not be repaired or something 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.350
 which is not very up to the finger 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.350
 quietly open 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:34.250
 but to demand not so much 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.250
 it turns out 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:44.680
 here's how everyone else thanks for watching 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.680
