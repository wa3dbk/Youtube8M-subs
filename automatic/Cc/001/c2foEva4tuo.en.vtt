00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
forth a little bit of course that is the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640 
forth a little bit of course that is the
magnet<00:01:26.790> i<00:01:27.030> call<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.360> say<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> looks

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
magnet i call it say because it looks

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.899 
magnet i call it say because it looks
like<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.070> chasing<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> magnet

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
like it's chasing it so you a magnet

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.859 
like it's chasing it so you a magnet
magnet<00:01:31.329> all<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.570> way<00:01:31.689> across<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.689> if

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
magnet all the way across that but if

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.559 
magnet all the way across that but if
you<00:01:35.049> want<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.289> do<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.679> simple<00:01:35.950> way<00:01:36.159> you

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
you want to do it the simple way you

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.099 
you want to do it the simple way you
just<00:01:37.890> basically<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:39.939> see<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.600> stops<00:01:40.899> at

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
just basically you can see it stops at

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.319 
just basically you can see it stops at
the<00:01:41.140> middle<00:01:41.469> sometimes<00:01:41.859> but<00:01:42.189> you're<00:01:42.969> just

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
the middle sometimes but you're just

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.230 
the middle sometimes but you're just
basically<00:01:43.509> doing<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.709> but<00:01:45.009> see<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.609> have<00:01:46.119> it

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
basically doing that but see I have it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.690 
basically doing that but see I have it
too<00:01:46.270> far<00:01:46.630> apart<00:01:46.719> so<00:01:47.679> sometimes<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.369> doesn't

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
too far apart so sometimes it doesn't

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.449 
too far apart so sometimes it doesn't
work<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:49.569> can<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> face<00:01:50.140> up<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.619> face<00:01:51.130> down

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
work you can do a face up to face down

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.010 
work you can do a face up to face down
it<00:01:52.390> doesn't<00:01:52.810> matter<00:01:52.929> but<00:01:53.740> um<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.929> recommend<00:01:55.929> if

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it doesn't matter but um I recommend if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.889 
it doesn't matter but um I recommend if
you're<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.200> beginner<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:57.209> doing<00:01:58.209> simple<00:01:58.539> one

something and you could put actually
tried<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.290> before<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.769> can<00:02:44.920> put<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.069> fork

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
tried this before you can put a fork

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.000 
tried this before you can put a fork
through<00:02:46.419> the<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.760> right<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.389> so<00:02:50.319> it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
through the this right here so it's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.339 
through the this right here so it's
basically<00:02:51.250> simple<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.060> stop<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
basically simple to stop it at the the

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.280 
basically simple to stop it at the the
middle<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.370> want<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.700> get<00:02:55.269> some<00:02:55.540> force<00:02:55.840> going

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
middle you want to get some force going

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.559 
middle you want to get some force going
and<00:02:56.500> then<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.829> drop<00:02:57.069> your<00:02:57.310> force<00:02:57.609> basically

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
and then just drop your force basically

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.940 
and then just drop your force basically
you're<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:59.019> like<00:02:59.139> this<00:02:59.380> go<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.769> like<00:02:59.919> this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you're going like this go on like this

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.589 
you're going like this go on like this
going<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.639> you<00:03:00.819> can<00:03:00.970> even<00:03:01.150> stop<00:03:01.359> over

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
going like this you can even stop over

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.539 
going like this you can even stop over
your<00:03:01.720> hand<00:03:01.989> if<00:03:02.169> you<00:03:02.260> want<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.680> don't<00:03:02.709> you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
can just slide it this way and this way

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.030 
can just slide it this way and this way
this<00:03:08.319> way<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.459> way<00:03:10.769> basically<00:03:11.769> simple

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
this way and this way basically simple

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.269 
this way and this way basically simple
so<00:03:12.730> I'll<00:03:12.910> see<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.150> next
