00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all guys as usual 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 frankie and I'm here today for this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.030
 new video where we're going to see 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.820
 the unboxing of the hd pvr 2 gaming edition 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 I feel very politically you see jim 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.809
 for decades but I took his and reins 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.820
 to do this very quick boxing 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.330
 also because you know that I am not really 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.949
 the classic type from video boxing 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 reviews but still this product 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.689
 which was a mandate from the peace that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.789
 thank you very much roberto that in short 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 responsible for air opacity for having me 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.800
 mandate this that is none other than the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 prize for winning the contest or peace 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 rewarded in addition to the one he sent me 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.290
 also the t-shirt that you will see among 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.300
 really very few moments why not 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 I can move, I know if I get the idea 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 however, if you see it here when 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 I will make video on the peace channel indeed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 I leave the link in the description 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 because you will also find them, register them 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 from your xbox 360 or ps3 in hd on your pc 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 that is not me but on your charge e 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 share your games with video games 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.430
 with a on youtube with a simple click 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.909
 in short, the usual stuff here of the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 strange with you maybe they say yes 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.810
 should be halo insults to go go and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 then here allowing you to play 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 record gameplay at the same time 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.390
 without loss of any speed includes 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 all the cables needed for the connection 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.880
 of your xbox including anyway 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.159
 let's move on to the opening of the package than for 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 do it guys i'll use something i have 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.250
 always wanted to do or the life of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 cutting editing then all together 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 let 's do the hands well ie from 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.360
 of the opening in margin reality or 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.700
 just the motorbikes the adhesive because this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.369
 is the first product I open for 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.650
 first time without I resisted 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.700
 very much so guys for the first one 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.680
 once with you no no no me 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 ruined the moment I have to make an extra 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.460
 then as in all areas nng 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.950
 generally we should start with 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.500
 the product or less important and therefore 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.600
 I will also do it because in reality I too 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.330
 I would like to see the pvr immediately, but no 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.390
 I have to keep the band well school 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.030
 farfense this thing here that is nothing else 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 that the thing or delicate components do 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 it should be it is what for 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 component cables find all the wires 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.890
 inside the package so this is the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.070
 first product that you will find inside 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.590
 of the magical confession so now 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.420
 we will boys magically do it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.569
 to disappear 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.910
 let's move on to the second product remains the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.900
 strange box we go to open 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:45.320
 together or my god my god my god 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 What is in and feeding or beautiful 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.040
 unbelievable things 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.680
 I don't know I feel too many emotions from 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.330
 do unboxing because I don't think it is 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 like the first time I do it because 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.959
 last time I did a year ago 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.420
 so for me it's all over again 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.690
 however, no classic power supply 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.400
 trivial game but of course also 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.730
 this we must make disappear and therefore 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.040
 then magical hand we pass to this that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.750
 instead another component cable that is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 what you practically have to do 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.379
 connect from the console 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.720
 because here you see there is the Cosenza for 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.340
 the console component cables that go 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.180
 we do these very well too 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.540
 disappear magically 123 then we have here 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.700
 instead a cable that goes from the usb to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.470
 your computer to the pvr then 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.659
 basically it's the cable you will need 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.670
 to connect the pvr from your computer 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.359
 so this is very important 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.680
 let's make our 31 disappear 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.040
 these cables no longer run out 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.260
 so a cable instead of going to HDMI 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.950
 hdmi which will be used to connect from 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.019
 television 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.629
 to the console to console 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.489
 TV is an HDMI cable 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.620
 but since there is not even one other equal 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.169
 we make them both disappear together 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.769
 so double magic so here's a 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.269
 double like 1 2 and 3 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.260
 and now the highlight that everyone 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:11.040
 they were waiting 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.910
 gentlemen the cd with the inside 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.949
 program registration software 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.370
 today or perhaps you reflected succeeded in 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.800
 see me maxi classroom well and this is it instead 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.030
 a very simple instruction manual 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.410
 this thing is a very useful utility that 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.940
 we make disappear in very few 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.410
 moments 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.620
 3 and then two and then one and now yes 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.510
 boys without too much delay we salute the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.770
 system that will help me record the 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.270
 gameplay certainly a quality 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.400
 major ladies and gentlemen the hd pvr 2 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.090
 that ming edition we go immediately 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 to open it if I succeed in its function 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:00.880
 paper away and look at it i mean ok 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.170
 honestly it's not that I do a lot 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.760
 much case perhaps to the design and of a 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.480
 acquisition system but this is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.340
 just cool to note the design 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.160
 how did that then if I'm not wrong 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.270
 this is a led that lights up 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.860
 here the logout pagg here we have mine 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.860
 reflection but hello 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.410
 well and here we are then arrived at 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.750
 conclusions of this unboxing for the hd 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.210
 pvr 2 chemical edition a product that 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.120
 very good I think definitely the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.650
 director with a quality really 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.850
 absurd that is, I vicari, however, below 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.070
 where click 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.020
 in the description or even a notation 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.100
 here somewhere to go to 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.630
 a video recording uploaded 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.030
 integrate without having to convert without 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.580
 to do anything is really a quality 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.500
 good I would say is entirely absurd st 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.169
 compared to all the videos I have 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.479
 recorded fine now you see a lot 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.400
 more details and then especially one 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.410
 which I loved a lot about 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.150
 this this product was the 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.510
 registration software because 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.880
 I can finally register 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.800
 simultaneously the gameplay with the 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.729
 my voice or even with the voice of the 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.009
 computer 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.800
 let's say if I had to make videos on 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.309
 skype with other people 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.129
 all the program can record 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:28.370
 simultaneously three tracks together on 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.139
 which is great because it finally doesn't 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.210
 I will have more of those horrendous problems 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.789
 desing then guys for this episode 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.589
 frankie's technology is all to itself 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.569
 I liked to remember leaving a 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.279
 nice i like that years support why 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.409
 now quality wanted levels 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:45.110
 astronomical passages on the page 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.969
 facebook of apache italia and passate 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.059
 also in their youtube channel because between 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:52.069
 little by a week maybe or even by 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:54.860
 less when I publish this video 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.259
 anyway it will come soon on that 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.469
 video channel not only mine but 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.449
 also of the whole audacity team that 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.729
 They are to be created so really gone 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.770
 this is because in short between clear and even 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.899
 I would therefore say that now it really is 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.729
 See you all at a next video 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.729
 as always straight for straight
