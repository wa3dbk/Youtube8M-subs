00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.360
 Change or part 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.909
 When the album and the temperature of the back teeth surprisingly high 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.909
 It is true 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.189
 To be able to use it with the usual body feeling to improve 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.099
 I put on the cover 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.859
 Kagawa is 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.839
 More than 20,000 yen used 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.169
 There is a definite variation of about 5 mm 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.169
 Let's play the color slightly 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.710
 Attach 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.660
 for that reason 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 I'm distributing it only by Ii card business 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.600
 So now I am not a socks 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 I finished the 15th first and this is the send button now 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470
 Use 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.300
 At a street store 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.740
 I'm wearing high 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.140
 From the future 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.920
 The envelope is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 Mook for that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.180
 I'm sticking 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.650
 This is the end 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.650
 Future features 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.330
 Did not come around once more or only one 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 Because 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 Only one 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.680
 If you have 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 Paste it in a good position of 2 strokes further 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.170
 In a form that protects from both Ireland 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.520
 It is good though it is 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.260
 A little earlier than that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.730
 The offer of the league also says that the future will be better 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
 Possible 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 I tried to attach 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.600
 It is like this 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.780
 Also in the same group 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.550
 Mr. Ban did not increase 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.130
 Where to read the picture book 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 I think I can use it if I have a little mind 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.649
 If it is a little like this before 73 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.480
 In the problem that has become 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.540
 Nagasaka 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.640
 I am Shonan 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.929
 Dance a little more at Mt. Fuji 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.099
 However 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.359
 b5 size 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:13.749
 somewhere 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.739
 Looking for it 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.649
 There was no Koka city 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.149
 At net home that we will use with this
