this way because it likes to be in the
shade<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:28.050> dying<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.830> Sun<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
shade of that so dying in the Sun and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:40.270 
shade of that so dying in the Sun and
growing<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.270> way<00:03:31.700> well<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:33.150> she<00:03:35.209> look<00:03:37.040> crazy

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:55.690 

turn<00:03:41.280> down

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.580 

but<00:03:56.240> you<00:03:56.390> sound

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.690 

similar<00:04:04.430> facts<00:04:04.790> with<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:06.220> water<00:04:07.220> current<00:04:07.489> I

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
similar facts with the water current I

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.620 
similar facts with the water current I
still<00:04:07.970> have<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:11.330> goes<00:04:11.480> on

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
still have to have this one that goes on

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.140 
still have to have this one that goes on
timer<00:04:11.900> for<00:04:12.140> six<00:04:12.470> hours<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:13.130> changed<00:04:13.880> up<00:04:13.970> the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
timer for six hours I changed up the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.729 
timer for six hours I changed up the
schedule<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.750> then<00:04:14.870> this<00:04:15.050> one<00:04:15.260> goes<00:04:15.410> up<00:04:15.590> for

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
schedule and then this one goes up for

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.810 
schedule and then this one goes up for
six<00:04:16.010> hours<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:17.060> way<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.230> this<00:04:19.040> one's<00:04:19.310> weaker

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
six hours this way so this one's weaker

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.030 
six hours this way so this one's weaker
then<00:04:20.389> this<00:04:20.570> one<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.680> have<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.859> strong

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
then this one is so I have a strong

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.620 
then this one is so I have a strong
current<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.580> then<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.760> weak<00:04:23.000> current<00:04:23.360> just

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
current and then a weak current just

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.340 
current and then a weak current just
like<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.870> Great<00:04:24.080> Barrier<00:04:24.290> Reef<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:26.419> come

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
like the Great Barrier Reef then come

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.190 
like the Great Barrier Reef then come
right<00:04:27.380> here

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
right here

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.700 
right here
it<00:04:30.200> also<00:04:30.380> have<00:04:30.770> another<00:04:31.100> pump<00:04:31.490> right<00:04:31.730> here

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
it also have another pump right here

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.600 
it also have another pump right here
that's<00:04:33.710> blowing<00:04:35.200> behind<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.470> rock<00:04:36.710> all<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
that's blowing behind the rock all the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.050 
that's blowing behind the rock all the
way<00:04:37.729> around<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.210> it's<00:04:38.540> blowing<00:04:38.900> through<00:04:39.200> here

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
way around so it's blowing through here

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.360 
way around so it's blowing through here
all<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.240> way<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.790> one<00:04:44.950> look<00:04:45.950> at<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
all the way this is one look at the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.950 
all the way this is one look at the
