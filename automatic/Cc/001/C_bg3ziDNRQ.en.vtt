00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
crash test with my I thought you know

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
crash test with my I thought you know
purple<00:00:10.980> ha<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> see<00:00:15.710> his<00:00:16.710> glass<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.930> for<00:00:18.930> tests

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
purple ha to see his glass and for tests

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:42.819 
purple ha to see his glass and for tests
I<00:00:19.580> tried<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.820> use<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.439> flash<00:00:22.439> card<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:41.059> losers

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
I tried to use a flash card and losers

00:00:42.829 --> 00:01:08.020 
I tried to use a flash card and losers
just<00:00:43.829> try<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:49.219> just<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:53.989> flash<00:00:54.989> card

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.080 

so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:12.170> scratch<00:01:15.230> next

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
so I not see the one scratch next

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:35.530 
so I not see the one scratch next
he's<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> flashcard<00:01:19.460> city<00:01:20.460> squeezers

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.210 

so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> probably<00:01:36.870> not<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.650> much<00:01:41.780> second<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
so I probably not see much second is a

00:01:43.220 --> 00:02:00.940 
so I probably not see much second is a
lie

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.980 

so<00:02:01.950> cool<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.549> no<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.330> know<00:02:03.830> why<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.860> don't

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
so cool it's no I don't know why I don't

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.460 
so cool it's no I don't know why I don't
see<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
see it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.790 
see it
probably<00:02:09.440> one<00:02:10.610> one<00:02:11.610> scratch<00:02:12.319> because<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.650> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
probably one one scratch because it is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:31.520 
probably one one scratch because it is
knife<00:02:14.280> its<00:02:16.790> simplest<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.870> next<00:02:31.319> is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
knife its simplest so and the next is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:53.960 
knife its simplest so and the next is
the<00:02:31.560> case<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:50.190> how<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.819> see<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.420> don't<00:02:52.970> you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the case so how do you see I don't you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:07.130 
the case so how do you see I don't you
know<00:02:55.010> word<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.459> scratched<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> true<00:03:06.140> first

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
know word is scratched so true first

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.199 
know word is scratched so true first
range<00:03:07.590> from<00:03:08.430> glass<00:03:09.680> sure<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.010> maybe<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
range from glass sure so maybe it is

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:20.350 
range from glass sure so maybe it is
because<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.829> original<00:03:14.549> iPod<00:03:15.110> not<00:03:16.110> cloth<00:03:18.769> so

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
because it is original iPod not cloth so

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.560 
because it is original iPod not cloth so
so<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.630> big<00:03:22.110> scratch<00:03:22.739> test

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
so it is big scratch test

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.180 
so it is big scratch test
