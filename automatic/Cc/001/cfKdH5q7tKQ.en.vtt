00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
make sure it goes around the wrist or

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.509 
make sure it goes around the wrist or
something<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:42.830> doesn't<00:03:43.099> fall<00:03:43.190> off<00:03:43.250> but

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
something so it doesn't fall off but

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:53.430 
something so it doesn't fall off but
can't<00:03:43.970> really<00:03:44.180> do<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.330> with<00:03:44.599> a<00:03:44.629> fan
