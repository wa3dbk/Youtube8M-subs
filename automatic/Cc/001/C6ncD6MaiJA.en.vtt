00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome to this workshop where i got started with 2 nice yet so extra 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.849
 difficult due to the game form and laptop or desktop PC 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.189
 You want a lap tops as you don't have too many difficulties with the 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.300
 expectation as sweet as any just on one 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.390
 additional 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 video output includes a van der expert visible during rush hour 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 Moolen that can fit in well with many of the CSs is that they are also such 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.430
 contains in that box and the graphics cards with two video outputs 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.730
 if that is not the case then you have to improve all the free cards 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.760
 and replace it with a new one with the river exits before you go 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.970
 to control the device click here current the screen can do that with 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.990
 the right mouse button and I'm going to undo you for the installation option 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.120
 after which you were confirmed okay 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.980
 windows that adapter will get the syringe after which you turn off the pc machines 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.590
 remove the old card and replace it with the new one with 2 video 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.390
 outputs 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.760
 if that happens you can connect the two screens to that and that is 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.430
 he will normally re-enable windows that will automatically cover against 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 the eventual you have to point the way to the corresponding turning for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.119
 the on cd dvd or maybe you have already done that engine off 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.330
 percent of the producer's website 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.970
 if you have the choice started and view the device manage then the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.320
 chances are that you will see something like the following two screens 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 driver's between correct with those of your first protected 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.350
 and then to general place in the play screen floater i think i am 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.450
 before the animals comes second 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.289
 that is not the correct version 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.340
 and you have to straighten that out 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.220
 you can do that by generally harassing three displays with 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.090
 right-clicking 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.890
 and then the option to choose drivers from everton 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.480
 I love that your door associated CD you have the right everywhere 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.510
 it is found on the website of the percent 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.000
 you choose is on my computer after we find drivers 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.719
 via the browse button he referred to the correct location most cases were insee 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.099
 driver 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.439
 let them but think your mouth including impressed smoking folders 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.339
 m afterwards you can 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.829
 continue to connect with pieces on next month if it is good 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.849
 East 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.829
 driver 7 m install the correct driver 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.200
 in my case that a draft horse is the same 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.309
 as the 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.929
 operating the first screen with it indeed goes on the week 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.129
 three monitors each 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 so the first lacie is already successful 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.789
 to be the right drivers that you install, but that doesn't mean 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.519
 It is imperative that we investigated the correct or the optimal settings that has 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.589
 When a last year's second picture creates that check if she's following you 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.889
 right click on an empty space on your desktop 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 and you choose the creation resolution option 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.909
 then your leg choose multiple screens with nothing 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.999
 the displays the bis rather moderate 3 the display can be expanded at 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.389
 both confirmed with 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.409
 to apply 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.569
 you get one for each of those screens and another picque anyway 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.639
 to see 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.900
 to know which screen belongs to which icon 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.279
 you can do the button 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.419
 identify this to click here 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.949
 you will then see the respective team or weather on top of 4 screens 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:33.819
 click here 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.359
 the speed nevertheless disaster of the second screen to people choose door optimal alice 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.569
 lucien for debate lcd screens called little fresh shower euro 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.419
 click cook and name the most advanced settings option 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.589
 m on a clear answer tab bild screen 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.469
 It is important that you leave a check mark on the motives for this 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.220
 cannot display the screen 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.570
 if that happened 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.350
 you can in principle use the drop-down menu at the renewal frequency 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.420
 select highest current highest values ​​that can be seen 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.469
 at how much it judged I assume you are going here the predictable colored 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:18.530
 32 bit assad spoke wish is set you can also confirm here with 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.700
 apply m with 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 on two 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.160
 you can also count which of the two displays to it 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.719
 Court of the World must be sharp, that is, the screens 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:37.990
 where, among other things, the compass rose start the taskbar 21st, it must be visible 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.430
 that is very easy you select the icon of the screen 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.400
 and you place a check next to the option to set this screen as the head 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.680
 display that is basically everything 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.919
 youth prince so meanwhile also experimented with options at 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.740
 multiple screens was standard publishing there is also the possibility to 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.659
 expansion 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.110
 and the ability to just turn the desktop on 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.150
 first 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.289
 or display a second screen 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.259
 now you use windows 7 then you don't need anything for 30 minutes 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.569
 doing is also something like the 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.269
 yes the shortcut key combination windowskey plus 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.699
 as soon as you press that starter combination, two screens 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:22.930
 You can see four icons on your screen and you can use the arrow keys 

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:27.739
 choose in which of the fourth view on booty you get to see exactly 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.389
 and so handy very easy 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.870
 to keep the large number of windows on your two monitors manageable 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.099
 You easily use traffic optics that is that small rectangle you 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.199
 here the far right on the taskbar 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.300
 or four user messages from this option from the context menu of the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.180
 taskbar 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.180
 so you can know the test has gone banks in different ways 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.870
 Finally, there are also a number when Chris Dyer works with two 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.990
 So making monitors a lot easier is one of the better ones 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.490
 juzhni floris the heavy commercial version that lets you down 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.349
 meant more 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.550
 for example, a tasks bars on both screen and let's see 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.400
 to background to combat that backgrounds across the two displays 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.819
 show different backgrounds 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.879
 some others argue until his dismay has the three clubs 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.199
 approached other toppers as his and ridiculous 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.619
 believe me freely 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:28.550
 I have been working with it for twelve years and I am sure that corner will soon be the 2 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.449
 screens do not miss anything anymore 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:32.659
 have fun or stuck
