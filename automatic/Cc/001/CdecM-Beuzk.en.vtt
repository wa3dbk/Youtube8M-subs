hey guys this one to make a quick video
updating<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.810> movement<00:00:06.810> or<00:00:07.080> click<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.740> move

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
updating the movement or click to move

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.820 
updating the movement or click to move
for<00:00:09.389> some<00:00:09.570> reason<00:00:09.870> when<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> game<00:00:10.349> charges

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
for some reason when the game charges

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.400 
for some reason when the game charges
the<00:00:10.950> player<00:00:11.160> starts<00:00:11.780> going<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.870> into<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> air

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the player starts going up into the air

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.129 
the player starts going up into the air
and<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.700> kept<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.690> until<00:00:15.870> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and just kept going on and on until you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170 
and just kept going on and on until you
clicked<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.070> there<00:00:17.609> was<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> simple<00:00:18.060> way<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
clicked and there was a simple way to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.790 
clicked and there was a simple way to
fix<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> go<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
fix that all you have to do is go in

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.290 
fix that all you have to do is go in
here<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.220> set<00:00:20.580> speed<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> zero<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.039> then<00:00:23.039> um

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
here and set speed to zero and then um

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.359 
here and set speed to zero and then um
in<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.199> adjust<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.250> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
in here you can adjust it so if you

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.320 
in here you can adjust it so if you
wanted<00:00:26.670> speed

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
wanted speed

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.429 
wanted speed
I<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:28.019> set<00:00:28.199> mine<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> 25<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.480> that's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> simple

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
I just set mine to 25 so that's a simple

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.569 
I just set mine to 25 so that's a simple
things<00:00:31.880> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.690> fix<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.579> also

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
things if you want to fix that also

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.910 
things if you want to fix that also
another<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.239> did<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.809> create<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.530> cool

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
another thing I did was create a cool

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520 
another thing I did was create a cool
effect<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> click<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> ground

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
effect that when you click on the ground

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.479 
effect that when you click on the ground
it<00:00:41.510> moves<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.629> character<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> also

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it moves your character but then it also

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.779 
it moves your character but then it also
displays<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.840> particle<00:00:46.410> effect<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.550> last

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
displays like a particle effect so last

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.170 
displays like a particle effect so last
time<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.000> created<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> particle<00:00:49.410> effect<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.059> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
time we created a particle effect and I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.639 
time we created a particle effect and I
was<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> minions<00:00:52.530> attack

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
was gonna use it for the minions attack

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.700 
was gonna use it for the minions attack
and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> decided<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.699> use<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.710> flicked

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and I decided to use this for my flicked

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.090 
and I decided to use this for my flicked
location<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> did<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> created

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
location so what I did was I created

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.900 
location so what I did was I created
that<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.989> then<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> went<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> prefabs<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that and then I went to prefabs and I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
that and then I went to prefabs and I
created<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.719> called<00:01:03.750> clicked<00:01:04.350> spawn<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.280> now

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
created one called clicked spawn and now

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
created one called clicked spawn and now
it<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.630> yeah<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> code<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.650> click<00:01:07.830> spawn<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it has yeah I code for click spawn and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.560 
it has yeah I code for click spawn and
this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:10.880> destroying<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.210> after<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this is just for destroying this after a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.010 
this is just for destroying this after a
certain<00:01:12.780> amount<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> set<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
certain amount of time so I set it to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.190 
certain amount of time so I set it to
zero<00:01:16.020> point<00:01:16.259> two<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.210> destroy<00:01:18.210> game<00:01:18.630> objects

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
zero point two and destroy game objects

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
zero point two and destroy game objects
and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.729> back<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> our<00:01:21.150> click<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and then we can go back to our click to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.770 
and then we can go back to our click to
move<00:01:21.810> script<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.549> threw<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> code

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.170 

right<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.020> here

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
right in here

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
right in here
so<00:01:30.180> it'll<00:01:30.990> keep<00:01:31.140> spawning<00:01:31.439> constantly<00:01:32.240> until

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so it'll keep spawning constantly until

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
so it'll keep spawning constantly until
the<00:01:33.420> player<00:01:33.630> gets<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> location<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the player gets to that location and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.020 
the player gets to that location and
then<00:01:35.430> it'll<00:01:35.670> fade<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.280> that's<00:01:38.280> pretty

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
then it'll fade out so that's pretty

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
then it'll fade out so that's pretty
much<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.330> scripts<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> do

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
much the scripts and then you want to do

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 
much the scripts and then you want to do
like<00:01:43.110> effects<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.580> put<00:01:45.030> click<00:01:45.240> effect

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
like effects and just put click effect

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.570 
like effects and just put click effect
in<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.429> do

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
in there if you don't know how to do

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.810 
in there if you don't know how to do
this<00:01:47.700> already<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> check<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this already and we can go and check it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.880 
this already and we can go and check it
out

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
out

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.669 
out
so<00:01:52.890> it'll<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.179> fade<00:01:54.420> out

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
so it'll go there and don't fade out

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.420 
so it'll go there and don't fade out
it's<00:01:55.679> pretty<00:01:55.890> cool

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.520 

so<00:02:00.430> that's<00:02:00.759> mice<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.600> know<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:02.049> other<00:02:02.229> games

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
so that's mice I know in other games

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.590 
so that's mice I know in other games

tutorials<00:02:16.120> today<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.420> ended<00:02:16.959> up<00:02:17.080> figuring<00:02:17.290> out

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
tutorials today I ended up figuring out

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.130 
tutorials today I ended up figuring out
a<00:02:17.620> different<00:02:17.860> way<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.489> do<00:02:18.640> movement<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.930> not

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
a different way to do movement it's not

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.199 
a different way to do movement it's not
smooth<00:02:20.470> yet<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.950> maybe<00:02:21.100> I'll<00:02:21.310> try<00:02:21.489> figuring

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
smooth yet so maybe I'll try figuring

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.610 
smooth yet so maybe I'll try figuring
out<00:02:22.330> how<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.540> smooth<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:22.989> out<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.410> bit

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
out how to smooth that out a little bit

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.140 
out how to smooth that out a little bit
but<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:24.069> are<00:02:24.280> spread<00:02:24.610> out<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:25.030> they

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
but they are spread out when they

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
but they are spread out when they
they're<00:02:25.569> walking<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> saw<00:02:27.280> them<00:02:27.340> figured

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
they're walking but I saw them figured

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
they're walking but I saw them figured
out<00:02:27.760> how<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.000> flip<00:02:28.330> them<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> yeah<00:02:30.519> we<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.790> uh

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
out how to flip them and yeah we can uh

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.110 
out how to flip them and yeah we can uh
I'll<00:02:32.170> try<00:02:32.620> making<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.220> couple<00:02:33.489> more<00:02:33.610> tutorials

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
