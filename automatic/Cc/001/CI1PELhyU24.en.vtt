00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
new redson tutorial we're doing a really

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.419 
new redson tutorial we're doing a really
cool<00:00:12.360> fireplace<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.889> toggle<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
cool fireplace and you can toggle on and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.880 
cool fireplace and you can toggle on and
off<00:00:14.639> that's<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
off that's it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.279 
off that's it
isn't<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.920> exciting<00:00:17.630> no<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:18.779> kidding

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
isn't that exciting no I'm kidding

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
isn't that exciting no I'm kidding
so<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.670> normal<00:00:21.029> looking

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so we have just a normal looking

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.000 
so we have just a normal looking
fireplace<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> mean<00:00:22.350> most<00:00:22.560> people<00:00:22.619> would<00:00:22.830> just

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
fireplace I mean most people would just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.290 
fireplace I mean most people would just
look<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> think<00:00:23.609> oh<00:00:23.820> cool<00:00:24.060> fire

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
look at this and think oh cool fire

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.609 
look at this and think oh cool fire
charges<00:00:24.720> maybe<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.260> relight<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
charges maybe it's just to relight the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.279 
charges maybe it's just to relight the
thing<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.730> yes<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.180> does<00:00:27.359> use<00:00:27.570> fire<00:00:27.810> charges

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
thing so yes this does use fire charges

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.839 
thing so yes this does use fire charges
not<00:00:28.410> flint<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.830> steel<00:00:28.890> cuz<00:00:29.400> fit<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.699> steel

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
not flint and steel cuz fit and steel

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.479 
not flint and steel cuz fit and steel
would<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.150> pop<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> dispensers<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
would just pop out of the dispensers on

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.319 
would just pop out of the dispensers on
xbox<00:00:32.489> ps3<00:00:32.820> anyways<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.910> as<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.030> see

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
xbox ps3 anyways so now as you can see

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.150 
xbox ps3 anyways so now as you can see
we<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.660> our<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.840> levers<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
we have our little levers here you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.420 
we have our little levers here you
should<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.489> don't<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.480> anything

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
should they don't really do anything

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.470 
should they don't really do anything
unless<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.790> both<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.329> time

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
unless you put both with the same time

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.729 
unless you put both with the same time
then<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.940> yeah<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.360> right

entrance<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> fireplace<00:00:54.000> tutorial<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
entrance a fireplace tutorial so this is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.939 
entrance a fireplace tutorial so this is
a<00:00:55.800> circuit<00:00:56.219> behind<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:57.620> these<00:00:58.620> walks

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
a circuit behind it that's these walks

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.810 
a circuit behind it that's these walks
are<00:00:59.100> extra<00:00:59.609> whoops<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
are extra whoops so this is the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
are extra whoops so this is the
circuitry<00:01:03.210> behind<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.500> nothing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
circuitry behind it that's like nothing

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.120 
circuitry behind it that's like nothing
actually<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> pretty<00:01:06.240> good<00:01:06.479> compared<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually this is pretty good compared to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.219 
actually this is pretty good compared to
other<00:01:08.130> people's<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.990> know

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
other people's and it's I don't know

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.600 
other people's and it's I don't know
it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.530> cool<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> cuz<00:01:11.430> there's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it's not as cool as this cuz there's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's not as cool as this cuz there's
like<00:01:11.760> opens<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> fancy<00:01:13.170> jibba

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like opens up and this is fancy jibba

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
like opens up and this is fancy jibba
jabba<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
jabba and stuff but I think this is

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
jabba and stuff but I think this is
pretty<00:01:15.840> cool<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.350> mean<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> does<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pretty cool I mean you know it does a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
pretty cool I mean you know it does a
trick<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.150> mean<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> build<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> on

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
trick I mean you can kind of build it on

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.020 
trick I mean you can kind of build it on
survival<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.020> infinite

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
survival if you have you know infinite

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
survival if you have you know infinite
blaze<00:01:24.030> powder<00:01:24.270> gunpowder<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
blaze powder gunpowder and that's that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
blaze powder gunpowder and that's that
kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> stuff<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.540> we're<00:01:27.540> gonna<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.960> kind

stair so for example we could do you
don't<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> wood<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> would

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
don't want to do wood because that would

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.109 
don't want to do wood because that would
just<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.369> stupid

pistons right here then replace it and
put<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.500> stairs<00:04:00.709> back<00:04:00.949> on<00:04:01.129> there<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.519> now

put the stairs back on there and now
we're<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.049> sticky<00:04:03.500> pistons<00:04:03.859> are<00:04:03.979> you<00:04:04.069> just

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.219 
we're the sticky pistons are you just

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.189 
we're the sticky pistons are you just
going<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.400> place<00:04:04.579> two<00:04:05.269> stairs<00:04:05.509> and<00:04:05.780> break<00:04:06.019> this

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
going to place two stairs and break this

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.039 
going to place two stairs and break this
here<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.269> then<00:04:08.269> you're<00:04:08.419> going<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.659> want<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.930> go

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
and just kind of place a quick little

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.860 
and just kind of place a quick little
block<00:04:10.939> block<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:13.299> now<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.329> just<00:04:14.359> gonna<00:04:14.599> want<00:04:14.780> to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
block block so now I just gonna want to

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.849 
block block so now I just gonna want to
go<00:04:14.959> grab<00:04:15.199> two<00:04:15.469> Pistons<00:04:15.979> like<00:04:16.759> this<00:04:17.560> very<00:04:18.560> very

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
go grab two Pistons like this very very

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.709 
go grab two Pistons like this very very
simple<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.519> think<00:04:19.699> these<00:04:19.820> are<00:04:20.090> all<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> pistons

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:20.719 
simple I think these are all the pistons

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.120 
simple I think these are all the pistons
you'll<00:04:20.870> nope<00:04:21.109> you're<00:04:21.320> gonna<00:04:21.590> need<00:04:21.769> two<00:04:21.949> more

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
you'll nope you're gonna need two more

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.730 
you'll nope you're gonna need two more
later<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.960> now<00:04:24.169> you're<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.469> want<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.650> go

later on so now you're just want to go

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.210 
later on so now you're just want to go
and<00:04:24.919> cover<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.400> area

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
and cover this area

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.920 
and cover this area
in<00:04:26.400> blue<00:04:26.610> wool<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.240> then<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.390> want<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.630> grab

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
in blue wool and then you want to grab

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.040 
in blue wool and then you want to grab
your<00:04:28.080> main<00:04:28.380> block<00:04:29.150> actually<00:04:30.150> right<00:04:31.020> here

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
your main block actually right here

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.220 
your main block actually right here
because<00:04:31.860> if<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.720> did<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.810> right<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.080> you

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
because if you did it right there you

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.300 
because if you did it right there you
would<00:04:34.350> see<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.530> blue<00:04:34.680> wool<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.010> inside

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
would see the blue wool on the inside

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.230 
would see the blue wool on the inside
and<00:04:35.850> not<00:04:36.210> only<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.540> but<00:04:36.720> right<00:04:36.960> there<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:39.120> now

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
you're just going to go and do the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.340 
you're just going to go and do the
following<00:04:40.350> pattern<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.160> want<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.370> place

following pattern so you want to place

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.070 
following pattern so you want to place
redstone<00:04:43.350> like<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.360> then<00:04:45.360> redstone<00:04:45.810> here

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
redstone like this then redstone here

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560 
redstone like this then redstone here
and<00:04:46.890> then<00:04:47.250> redstone<00:04:47.760> repeaters<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.360> this

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
and then redstone repeaters like this

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.480 
and then redstone repeaters like this
and<00:04:48.870> then<00:04:48.990> two<00:04:49.320> repeaters<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:49.770> again<00:04:50.280> this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
and then two repeaters here again this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.190 
and then two repeaters here again this
part<00:04:50.730> is<00:04:50.790> optional<00:04:50.910> you're<00:04:51.870> going<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.080> place

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
part is optional you're going to place

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.100 
part is optional you're going to place
redstone<00:04:52.620> curving<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.430> like<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.870> now<00:04:54.870> you're

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
redstone curving in like this now you're

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.390 
redstone curving in like this now you're
going<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.290> want<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.440> do<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.740> don't<00:04:55.980> place<00:04:56.130> a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
going to want to do is you don't place a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360 
going to want to do is you don't place a
piston<00:04:56.910> either<00:04:57.360> here<00:04:57.840> or<00:04:57.870> here<00:04:58.140> um<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:59.130> doesn't

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
piston either here or here um it doesn't

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.320 
piston either here or here um it doesn't
matter<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.640> depends<00:04:59.910> on<00:04:59.940> how<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.120> want<00:05:00.300> to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
matter it depends on how you want to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.150 
matter it depends on how you want to
build<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.630> I've<00:05:01.230> informed<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.740> be<00:05:01.830> right<00:05:01.950> here

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
build it I've informed to be right here

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.230 
build it I've informed to be right here
because<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.760> looks<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.970> little<00:05:03.030> bit

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
because I think it looks a little bit

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.280 
because I think it looks a little bit
better<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:04.050> they're<00:05:04.260> gonna<00:05:04.440> place<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:06.290> piston

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
better so they're gonna place a piston

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.020 
better so they're gonna place a piston
there<00:05:07.710> with<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:07.920> blue<00:05:08.160> block<00:05:08.430> two<00:05:09.000> blocks

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
there with a blue block two blocks

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.480 
there with a blue block two blocks
underneath<00:05:09.570> with<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.750> torch<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.200> top<00:05:10.490> then

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
underneath with a torch on top then

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.560 
underneath with a torch on top then
you're<00:05:11.640> going<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.910> want<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.150> go<00:05:12.210> in<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.420> LAN

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
you're going to want to go in your LAN

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.050 
you're going to want to go in your LAN
grab<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:13.490> block<00:05:14.490> there<00:05:15.830> redstone<00:05:17.060> another

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
grab a block there redstone another

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.590 
grab a block there redstone another
block<00:05:18.330> here<00:05:19.220> with<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:21.620> repeater<00:05:24.080> block<00:05:25.080> and

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
block here with a repeater block and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.640 
block here with a repeater block and
like<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.630> whole<00:05:27.840> bunch<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.050> keys<00:05:28.200> outside<00:05:28.380> like

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
like a whole bunch of keys outside like

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.159 
like a whole bunch of keys outside like
that<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.490> now<00:05:29.580> we<00:05:29.640> have<00:05:29.910> our<00:05:30.270> like<00:05:30.930> little

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
that so now we have our like little

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.510 
that so now we have our like little
triangle<00:05:31.680> design<00:05:31.919> thing<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.220> what<00:05:32.310> I'm<00:05:32.370> gonna

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
triangle design thing or what I'm gonna

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.130 
triangle design thing or what I'm gonna
call<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:32.820> we<00:05:33.240> need<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.450> do<00:05:33.540> that<00:05:33.630> again<00:05:33.990> on<00:05:34.110> the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
call it we need to do that again on the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.680 
call it we need to do that again on the
other<00:05:34.260> side<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:34.830> we're<00:05:34.919> gonna<00:05:35.100> do<00:05:35.310> block<00:05:35.690> block

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
other side so we're gonna do block block

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.370 
other side so we're gonna do block block
block<00:05:37.340> then<00:05:38.340> we're<00:05:38.669> gonna<00:05:38.760> need<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.060> do<00:05:39.380> I

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
block then we're gonna need to do I

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.950 
block then we're gonna need to do I
think<00:05:40.919> it's<00:05:41.010> like<00:05:41.130> block<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.910> then<00:05:42.030> block<00:05:42.600> and

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
think it's like block and then block and
