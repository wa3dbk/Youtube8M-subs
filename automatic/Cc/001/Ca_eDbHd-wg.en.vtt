00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello girls welcome one more good day 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 Well, I bring a shopping video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.309
 it's only a week to go finally 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 of the holidays so I had to 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.559
 buy some things paste several 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 are for example solar and good ap that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 with other things that I also 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.990
 I wanted to have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 one of the things that I bought was this 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.450
 which here is 3m was quite cheap 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 I think four or five consisted 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.230
 euros nothing else anyway you know 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.880
 that all prices and photos that's 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.710
 little on the blog I had already used 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.780
 to be here but instead of the abode that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 it's stronger had still used the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.520
 rose that is number 4 but there was not 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.989
 seen and also to see that there was more 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.090
 strong yet you already know for me 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.879
 I decided to try it because the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 that I usually use is 16 euros 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.260
 and good a little to see if any a 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.059
 a little more low-end work me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.739
 well I told you nyman had the video of 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.050
 finished products that I had bought 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.879
 an ethnic joke and that there was 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.440
 improved only one day so 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.900
 many of you in the comments I 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.370
 comments stage that the solar great 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.380
 just very good so in particular the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.480
 of spray last quite the truth is that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.400
 this lot bought it more for me 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.350
 boyfriend because he does not like anything to put on 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.690
 cream is very uncomfortable texture 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.290
 and so it was in jest as well I will 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 bought protection 20 because it's 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.600
 he uses and well let's see how 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.190
 it works we will take it on vacation 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.040
 where I went to buy it they did not have 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 Highest protection of 20 great so 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.500
 I saw this one that is hawaiian tropic and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 it's protection 30 I do not know how it will be 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.710
 with him that is coconut and mango has 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 good paint all the lots of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.190
 Hawaiian tropic in general are 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.680
 pretty good so we'll try how 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.710
 and what also comprises the great was 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.960
 this ace also stop in haze format and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.810
 Seeing it like that, I wanted to try it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 also the access before the great is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.400
 for me it is the one of a lifetime 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 remembers much to my vacation 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.110
 always with my sisters with my parents 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.479
 I do not know is what I like best hope 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.509
 that the smell is the same as the cream 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.880
 because I'm passionate about the smell I still have three 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.610
 ritual shower foams you already know that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.310
 they are my favoritismos bath gels 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.610
 they had said that if you took two 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.580
 units that went to 20% so 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.010
 I decided to buy the orange that is the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
 sweet now is gancedo I like it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.090
 very much how it smells and there was already 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.070
 I used the exfoliant and decided to fuck 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 also that of the limited edition of 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.680
 summer that is called man dilute and is of 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.270
 frank and for me and rice milk me 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.250
 I really like how it smells a lot more 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.050
 sweet to those that I have had rituals 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.090
 but I really like the smell so I 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.100
 I decided to try it because being an edition 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 limited if I did not buy it I was going to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.860
 lose insurance take advantage of perfumery 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.320
 general to buy me also my corrector 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.170
 film and maybelline in tone 20 by 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.270
 some reason they have stopped making the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.540
 25 and they have done me a lot of work because 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.760
 It is my summer corrector or yes so 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.530
 I put the good that you are cleaning 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.209
 because the truth is that right away 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.880
 is the brown now I'm back to catch 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.750
 pretty color but right away it's going to 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 go so I put it back I bought it too 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.930
 the draft but instead of the tone 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.790
 online I bought it in nude tone 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.590
 that is a little bit darker and it comes 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.150
 very good now that I'm a little 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.740
 tanned for those days when 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.270
 I do not want it to look like I'm going makeup 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.340
 but I already know that the ojera mela 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.349
 I always cover because I have a lot 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.819
 and although it is corrector is not 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.920
 very common in fact it is a coverage 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.560
 pretty light, so at least 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.330
 the disguises a little bit I do here a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.580
 triangle as you saw and my routine 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.260
 express 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.700
 what we blur the ned and blender I put a 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.019
 little bit of suntan lotion and that 's the routine 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.060
 that I'm following so this 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.340
 corrector for that function I like 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.590
 quite as I tell you the film corrector 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
 and in level 25 I can not find it 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.099
 at a good and dead level it must be that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.440
 he has withdrawn it so I bought myself a 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.290
 mineral ice that I like very much in the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.120
 tone in the c 35 I bought it 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.060
 precisely for when you are quite 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.130
 brunette as I go is on vacation the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.930
 beach tan is pretty intense 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.730
 although it is true that it is going very soon 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.910
 but for those days we can put a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.090
 corrector so you see this is perfect 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.889
 in this 35 is the mineral corrector eyes 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.289
 de mar is a proofreader that the truth 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.180
 like a lot happens a bit like with this 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.370
 that does not have good coverage is more 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.590
 covering it but it's a little on 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.210
 the line is not almost covering but the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.770
 true that it blurs pretty well or 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.199
 disguises pretty well 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.509
 imperfections And finally you 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.150
 I teach a mascara is more 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.520
 and it's the new one called hour flash but 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.860
 a union very different from what we are 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.560
 accustomed is very very tiny of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.199
 silicone and my partner told me that 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.750
 I left the super super super lashes 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.639
 separate is not so much to give volume 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.639
 but as if to leave them very nice 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.479
 separate and long, in fact she me 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.650
 said leaves butterfly wing eyelashes 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.419
 so I really wanted to 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.220
 try it you know that I'm a fan of 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.360
 the eyelash masks so I already 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.860
 I'll tell you how 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.659
 Well nothing girls these have been my 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.699
 little shadows to prepare for 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.560
 my vacation there are some little things 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.690
 necessary and others a little bit capricious 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 as the bathroom foams have been but 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.620
 the truth is that they stayed very very very 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.830
 cheap ones they stayed two for the price of 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.360
 one so I could not resist in short 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.949
 I hope you liked it a lot
