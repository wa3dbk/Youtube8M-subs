00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.920
 Hello flag the monetary in this video the as Rome 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.160
 Colt rate 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.350
 carbohydrates 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.350
 Year 10 special foods the 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.449
 make sure you have enough energy 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.489
 The important thing many people do not know about carbohydrates is not they vital 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.769
 can even live without cabbage 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.359
 The always strength sports area and especially banks build muscle 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.499
 Anyone who definitely recommends eating enough carbohydrates 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.899
 There are two different groups in coal there is once the 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.200
 long-chain carbohydrates and the artful charcoal Trotta 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.620
 It is important to know that these are 2 different ones 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.400
 Kohler dpa 78 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.820
 and they each have different advantages 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.839
 while blank Adiga coal traders look like 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.109
 Noodles from rice or from potatoes oatmeal as are different types 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.170
 of long-chain 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.640
 Coal kicked 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.650
 the utilities for a long time with energy 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.880
 especially from sports or 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.159
 as a lunch 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.109
 Use Cannoli to have enough energy within a few hours 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.009
 or to have the training from a rich house and there's short-chain 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.690
 carbohydrates 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.250
 because contrary to the example chocolate sweets sugar 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 so 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.740
 especially the things 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.820
 in processes period 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.370
 Give Phil Power if, for example, Cross Sport should do it now, you know 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.620
 Are you too Kurt feels too full of face 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.210
 and so is, for example 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 yes also a Mars Roland Sackers best note that in Herten short time 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.220
 get energy again 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.420
 and so it is the effect 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.150
 from these two different coal came and these two different cabbages 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.829
 One is also today 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.080
 use different 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.830
 that means that for example Kurzke thick coal Trotta 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.300
 Bite should take time and long-chained Cultra then bitten times 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 if only one thing has stopped then is a person 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.860
 as well as gaining weight quite easily too 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.500
 then I recommend you for example in the evening 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.710
 respectively 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 an hour or 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.889
 Immediately before take-off no coal wire will take any more 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.360
 long-chain yet short Koenig icon Trade 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.839
 for now go 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.450
 yes Reinhard Cannabis as a person who 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.049
 Unbelievable difficulties are gaining weight 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.549
 then I can definitely recommend 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 Just before bedtime, long-chain carbohydrates are increasing in the evening 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.889
 or you can do it 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.519
 come to Rome without a list box 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.000
 You can use that around 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.619
 reinforced again 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.829
 to profit from the trend 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.149
 but I do not want to exaggerate 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.139
 on the one hand worthy of cannabis 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.109
 In the evening reduce as much as possible that does not attach too much fat 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.449
 Colt rates can lead to it so easy 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.979
 yes, that's why I sometimes do not want to overdo it with fat 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.249
 When process chain is the basic question is good is immediate 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.199
 and after training in then you can do it very well 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.159
 especially after training 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.749
 Yes if 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.339
 physically is special 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.369
 Hormones are lying down 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.950
 shake off through the crown and carry through a cabbage ride 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.589
 you can get it through the insulin 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.459
 build better muscle but this special effects it especially after the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.289
 Training thought 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:28.319
 You can use it before training just to get more power at the end of March 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.969
 just feels a little tired 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.059
 So use short-chain carbohydrates 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.410
 long-chain carbohydrates in thale i you 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.659
 as a breakfast 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.599
 at lunchtime 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.879
 afternoon 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.289
 or as an evening meal 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.469
 while it may be easier to use 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.739
 to have enough energy to the number sufficient power 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.820
 then there is something very important what is here 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.550
 yes also just wants to say and while there serve as a source you can share 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.550
 Index became 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.609
 especially cheaper for animals 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.759
 around 20 times there 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.699
 the insulin secretion 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.279
 the higher the insulin distribution in scene 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.149
 the more 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.359
 Sugars start to get shot in the bloodstream and it has pros and cons 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.839
 if, for example, it is up to the principle yes 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.579
 good that you picture with as possible 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.199
 Kohl came to him 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.519
 So Gluten Stilmix can have it 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.519
 on the internet, look under for chemical index 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.330
 Yakult Rades are good for taking after training or you can even 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.279
 no power measured by weak 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.569
 Gruhl enter 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.879
 low wise celestial index I can recommend you then 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.240
 yes, if I, for example 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.139
 noon or walk 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.469
 What food we subjectively need as a good thing 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.599
 and they last for several hours 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.719
 the disadvantage with 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.590
 Coal was a mockery 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.330
 from Kenshin next episodes and secondly one 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.259
 Kik watch for the highly toxic and once 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.400
 Tour Aircooled Council is a 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.819
 ONP wisely standing next, the relatively fast down again 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.099
 and so was the setting one before 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.779
 remember at noon 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.949
 or even in the afternoon if it's something sweet, for example 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.449
 because until relatively quickly get tired again yes 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.819
 that is the effect 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.319
 and therefore you also know these fast food chains the hamburger is the 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.309
 Corn is white with products I mix a heart very high Flouquet index 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.039
 will you 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:24.990
 first 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.990
 "When I'm tired at lunch things 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.479
 and also up to now, cravings seem to get so you can 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.400
 Whole menu food what still hungry it is not a coincidence but 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.770
 It is for the reason that there are usually mild white flour scenes and everything 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.210
 I would have to have a mix of styles and make sure you're easy 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:46.960
 tired and tired 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.189
 by false reasons, therefore, stepped 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.360
 I can do that for you 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.669
 not to mention that fast food Inc Raymond of course no single 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.830
 as a relative hated to who it is okay but also wholegrain bread has one 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.039
 lower Flouquet mix index and 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.509
 this effect is reduced or completely reduced so you are 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.399
 no longer so tired what a lot of hunger and especially people the software 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.479
 Of course, that's it 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.050
 yes you might want to lose weight 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.589
 Price alone important 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.939
 to watch for whole grains 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.909
 I really hope to have the clouds in this video 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.069
