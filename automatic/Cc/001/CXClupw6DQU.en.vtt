shock bodies so you can actually adjust
your<00:02:29.560> shocks<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.510> shock<00:02:31.510> positions<00:02:32.110> for

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
your shocks and shock positions for

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.960 
your shocks and shock positions for
something<00:02:32.799> this<00:02:32.920> small<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> breathe<00:02:33.519> pretty

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
something this small is breathe pretty

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.250 
something this small is breathe pretty
nice

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
nice

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.740 
nice
again<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.160> brushless<00:02:36.519> so<00:02:37.060> I'm<00:02:37.420> not<00:02:37.690> sure

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
again it is brushless so I'm not sure

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.530 
again it is brushless so I'm not sure
what<00:02:38.319> kind<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.620> brushes<00:02:39.040> systems<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.060> what

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
what kind of brushes systems in it what

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.690 
what kind of brushes systems in it what
kind<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.780> KB<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> or<00:02:41.920> whatnot

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
kind of KB it is or whatnot

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.130 
kind of KB it is or whatnot
I<00:02:42.730> do<00:02:43.180> know<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> spectrum<00:02:44.739> receiver

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
I do know that it is a spectrum receiver

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.009 
I do know that it is a spectrum receiver
another<00:02:47.140> thing<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.970> servo<00:02:49.840> is

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
another thing is is that the servo is

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.740 
another thing is is that the servo is
not<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> normal<00:02:50.410> servo<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.420> looks<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.540> it's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
not a normal servo it's looks like it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.199 
not a normal servo it's looks like it's
almost<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> little<00:02:53.319> motor<00:02:53.709> servo<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
almost like a little motor servo this is

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.360 
almost like a little motor servo this is
more<00:02:55.420> than<00:02:55.569> more<00:02:56.350> than<00:02:56.380> three<00:02:56.739> wires<00:02:56.950> there

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
more than more than three wires there

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.819 
more than more than three wires there
the<00:02:58.359> ESC<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.170> receiver<00:02:59.769> is<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.100> one<00:03:00.609> unit<00:03:00.850> board

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
the ESC and receiver is a one unit board

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.280 
the ESC and receiver is a one unit board
there's<00:03:02.829> down<00:03:03.190> fault<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.150> fault<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.109> that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
there's down fault and a fault to that

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.830 
there's down fault and a fault to that
it's<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.329> like<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:08.280> beginner<00:03:09.280> stage

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's it's more like a beginner stage

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.650 
it's it's more like a beginner stage
before<00:03:10.840> pre<00:03:11.170> RC<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.769> have<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.889> deal<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:13.450> pretty

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
before pre RC to have a deal it's pretty

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.840 
before pre RC to have a deal it's pretty
nice<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.799> bottom<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.280> where<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.609> access

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
nice on the bottom is where you access

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.210 
nice on the bottom is where you access
your<00:03:16.120> battery<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.139> little<00:03:17.380> tray<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.980> pull

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
your battery it's a little tray you pull

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.729 
your battery it's a little tray you pull

there as far as the car goes it's a
pretty<00:03:53.109> nice<00:03:53.319> built<00:03:53.650> car<00:03:53.950> I'm<00:03:54.160> surprised<00:03:54.609> that

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
pretty nice built car I'm surprised that

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.319 
pretty nice built car I'm surprised that
surprised<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.040> it's<00:03:57.549> actually<00:03:57.880> last<00:03:58.090> as

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
surprised that it's actually last as

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.930 
surprised that it's actually last as
long<00:03:58.540> have<00:03:58.840> how<00:03:59.709> we<00:03:59.769> been<00:04:00.160> beating<00:04:00.549> on<00:04:00.639> it<00:04:00.820> and

this<00:04:02.799> car<00:04:03.040> will<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.760> other<00:04:04.120> views<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.260> just

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
this car will be in other views of just

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.500 
this car will be in other views of just
bashing<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.489> stuff<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:06.939> that<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.269> then<00:04:07.390> the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
of grass rugs I know that sounds kind of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.600 
of grass rugs I know that sounds kind of
weird<00:04:48.789> how<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.800> know<00:04:50.919> we<00:04:51.010> can't<00:04:51.220> really<00:04:51.340> go<00:04:51.520> on

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
weird how you know we can't really go on

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.200 
weird how you know we can't really go on
rugs<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.650> it's<00:04:53.650> just<00:04:53.800> for<00:04:54.039> me<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.460> don't<00:04:55.090> want

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
rugs but it's just for me I don't want

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
to risk it on rugs because I know we can

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.600 
to risk it on rugs because I know we can
burn<00:04:57.910> out<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.300> motor<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.199> ESC<00:04:59.350> so<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
burn out the motor and ESC so it's a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.700 
burn out the motor and ESC so it's a
pretty<00:05:00.789> nice<00:05:01.000> scale<00:05:01.360> car<00:05:01.630> for<00:05:01.900> just<00:05:02.199> driving
