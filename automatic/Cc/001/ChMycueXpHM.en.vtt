00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 me 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.970
 we are on the Modena circuit one of the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.750
 last works of the racetracks more 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.550
 new fates in Italy in recent years 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.950
 details on his ups and downs and his 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 tight curves sequence all the a 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.260
 to connect we tested a car here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 fantastic new lotus evora s 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590
 d 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.920
 a light car with a big engine 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.110
 lady of 3500 cc c but is enriched by 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.740
 a volumetric compressor that gives not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.990
 there are so many horses at the top you can 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 drive safely as if it were a 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.330
 Bourbon car a capacity of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.780
 resume at 800 laps already in the sixth 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 march 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.270
 the secret is not only in the couple 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.789
 obviously at high risk of the limited 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.039
 very small but what amazes us is 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.340
 just his ending the ability to 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.280
 bristles to attack the tail like few others 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.369
 other cars today I point out the direct 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.560
 there is little competition and effort to keep the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.590
 wake of the evora s 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.020
 when the mixture becomes tight and rich 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 of curves in counterslope or curves 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.390
 rapids to be connected in succession 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.209
 direct the feeling with him very fast 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.890
 steering is crazy you have the feeling of 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.390
 have your hands directly in contact 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.750
 with the ground 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.069
 so much is direct and immediate every 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 transposition of what there is of grip 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.930
 and between the tire and the same 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.420
 the secret of his success passes 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.390
 through a reduced weight the frame 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.489
 spaceframe in very light aluminum 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.420
 of suspensions with angles of 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.739
 cannes custer and front pin team 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.450
 really the right ones for sporty driving 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.450
 for driving on the track 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.319
 its main feature is the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.469
 reactivity the speed with which it engages 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.810
 the rope and holds trajectories 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.790
 very tight at high speed 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 once turned on latin in disabling 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 completely control systems 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.159
 of traction and control of 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.290
 stability turns out in the car 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.260
 exciting is not an easy car to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.840
 manage because the oversteer is always 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.900
 of rolling the car is oversteer the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.639
 full insertion has exited braking and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.250
 quickly turning the steering wheel 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.180
 transfers all the drift in a flash 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.069
 anterior and posterior symptomatic 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.349
 easily a band with a loss 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.629
 of grip easily controllable with 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.459
 of the counter-steering but be careful with the 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.340
 gas because the volumetric compressor 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.769
 provides an exorbitant pair already at 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.409
 2,000 rpm so just touch 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.540
 the accelerator to trigger a 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.540
 more oversteer in it gives more 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.739
 a true thoroughbred that aesthetically 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 at times it recalls the best seen so far 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.239
 with the writings the workhorse 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.120
 lotus historian that we find in the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.030
 sharp shape of the snout with the headlights 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.759
 very long and sloping on the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.729
 rear side and air intake 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.940
 on the bonnet where we have two radiators 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.220
 almost completely horizontal everything 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.350
 this along with spaceframe comes 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.800
 taken up by what was introduced with the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.440
 elise exige bigger and more voluminous 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.750
 also capable of two small seats on the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.389
 rear then one two on two 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.530
 slightly sacrificed the little fears 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.250
 on the back 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.250
 right behind the engine but a guide 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.250
 extraordinary
