00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.070
 just do not lose in front of you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.070
 why are you behind you 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.970
 against the cars through the air 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.560
 that philipp k remembers it like that 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.420
 fast and furious movies again and again 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 create new ideas to present 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:28.720
 that's awesome it's a beast 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.630
 This car is just super cool from one 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.160
 car gets ne completely different league with the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.670
 idea of â€‹â€‹the flipper we have been around for some time 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.680
 played 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.700
 Justin wanted one vehicle the other 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.260
 cars high in the air catapults that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.149
 design pastors show 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.250
 he is someone in the eye of the frontal 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.470
 Storm rages and everything destroys him 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.180
 gets in the way 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.860
 stays on course this car made on 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 most work we have it from reason 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.940
 built on new 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.430
 it ends up with a Formula 1 car group 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.080
 deep and wide 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.780
 too loud like a t-rex the one from the back 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.530
 in the ear a giant motor roars with eight 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.640
 cylinders producing over 500 ps 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.800
 equipped with rear wheel steering the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.120
 operated from here 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.650
 you can turn the wheel axles to the left and 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.190
 steer right and thus backwards 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.260
 beautiful pirouettes regulates the 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.970
 print 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.470
 the cars fly over it and that 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.470
 increases safety for the driver and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.160
 five police cars are already flying through 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.410
 the air drives the mileage 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.210
 Great there was little room for error 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.180
 our commitments as so far too 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.740
 go just like possible what where 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.400
 everything is well rehearsed we have to as 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.350
 team work perfectly 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 in a test we have a small one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.930
 ramp on that philipp k built 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 I thought it was worth trying 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.940
 our surprise brought our 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.720
 flipchart actually a police car 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.640
 to take off 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 In the film two drivers race head-on 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.070
 we really have that in common with each other 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.960
 Turned timing is the key 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.440
 it depends on centimeters if we 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.880
 fail the car overturns in 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 Justine saw what we are capable of 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.040
 and said I want more 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.700
 Police cars even more about beating yet 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.290
 more crashes when a car turns and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 flying through the air then it just works 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 right and not with computer tricks one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.010
 gets a real car slaughter too 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.690
 see how your program 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.250
 I have the flip kg loves the fans 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.930
 ask each time with which places 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.720
 they are now on the start and over again 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:41.380
 surprisingly fast and furious 6 from 23 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.380
 May in the cinema
