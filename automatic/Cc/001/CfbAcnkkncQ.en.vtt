00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.250 

jasor<00:02:16.049> kicking<00:02:16.739> aside<00:02:17.209> how<00:02:18.209> did<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.629> as

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
jasor kicking aside how did you think as

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
jasor kicking aside how did you think as
I<00:02:19.290> said<00:02:19.530> without<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.040> goal<00:02:20.190> kicking<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.519> team

still<00:02:21.239> went<00:02:21.420> quite<00:02:21.599> well<00:02:21.750> yeah<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.709> did<00:02:23.220> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
still went quite well yeah we did I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.210 
still went quite well yeah we did I
thought<00:02:23.879> we<00:02:24.000> dominated<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.840> physically<00:02:25.560> you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
thought we dominated them physically you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
thought we dominated them physically you
know<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.549> obviously<00:02:26.640> scored<00:02:27.269> two<00:02:27.450> tries<00:02:27.599> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
know and obviously scored two tries to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.140 
know and obviously scored two tries to
their<00:02:28.049> one<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.760> pretty<00:02:29.909> disappointing

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
their one so it's pretty disappointing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390 
their one so it's pretty disappointing
losing<00:02:30.959> games<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.310> how
