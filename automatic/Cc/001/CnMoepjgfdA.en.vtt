my 30 travelers notebook just so that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.799 
my 30 travelers notebook just so that
you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.879> size<00:00:52.120> difference<00:00:52.149> it's<00:00:52.750> not

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
you can see the size difference it's not

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.010 
you can see the size difference it's not
it's<00:00:53.289> pretty<00:00:53.620> much<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:54.039> same<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.570> that's<00:00:58.780> what

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
it's pretty much the same so that's what

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.510 
it's pretty much the same so that's what
it<00:00:59.110> looks<00:00:59.260> like<00:00:59.379> I<00:00:59.620> purchased<00:01:00.129> it<00:01:00.250> before<00:01:00.489> I

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
it looks like I purchased it before I

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.750 
it looks like I purchased it before I
think<00:01:00.840> once<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:01.899> do<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.140> conversion<00:01:02.760> including

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
think once I do the conversion including

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.520 
think once I do the conversion including
the<00:01:03.850> shipping<00:01:04.180> price<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:04.869> everything<00:01:05.050> I

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
the shipping price and everything I

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.000 
the shipping price and everything I
believe<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.009> came<00:01:06.130> up<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.460> about<00:01:06.549> 270<00:01:07.299> dollars

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
believe it came up to about 270 dollars

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.920 
believe it came up to about 270 dollars
so<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.040> don't<00:01:09.549> think<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.729> was<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:09.880> it's<00:01:10.780> not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
so I don't think it was that it's not

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.700 
so I don't think it was that it's not
too<00:01:11.110> too<00:01:11.380> bad<00:01:11.560> I<00:01:12.520> will<00:01:13.479> mention<00:01:14.020> some<00:01:14.200> things

to<00:02:03.219> notice<00:02:03.369> like<00:02:03.670> there's<00:02:03.909> kind<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.240> cracking

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to notice like there's kind of cracking

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
certain parts and then there's this one

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190 
certain parts and then there's this one

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
very rough very rough I don't think I'll

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.470 
very rough very rough I don't think I'll
use<00:03:34.150> these<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:35.250> your<00:03:36.250> scissors<00:03:36.670> in<00:03:36.880> there<00:03:37.120> and

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
really nice so I think I might I don't

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.640 
really nice so I think I might I don't
think<00:03:42.489> I'll<00:03:42.579> use<00:03:42.609> both<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:44.410> nice<00:03:44.620> to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
think I'll use both but it's nice to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.240 
think I'll use both but it's nice to
know<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.459> backups<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:47.230> do<00:03:47.829> like<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
know that I have backups I do like the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.370 
know that I have backups I do like the
fact<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.549> there<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.209> small<00:03:49.630> little<00:03:49.690> pocket

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
fact that there is a small little pocket

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.349 
fact that there is a small little pocket
here<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.549> mainly<00:03:54.819> want<00:03:55.180> to

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
here and then I think I mainly want to

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.280 
here and then I think I mainly want to
use<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:56.500> month<00:03:56.769> onto<00:03:57.340> page<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.959> then<00:03:59.109> there's

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
use the month onto page and then there's

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.069 
use the month onto page and then there's
some<00:03:59.470> lined<00:03:59.769> pages<00:04:00.069> as<00:04:00.430> well<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:01.150> come<00:04:01.359> with

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
some lined pages as well that come with

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.710 
some lined pages as well that come with
the<00:04:02.290> refills<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.579> is<00:04:03.760> in<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.060> b7<00:04:04.540> size

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the refills and this is in the b7 size

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.349 
the refills and this is in the b7 size
which<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.139> I<00:04:05.200> guess<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:06.639> same<00:04:06.849> as<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
which is I guess is the same as the

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.259 
which is I guess is the same as the
pocket<00:04:07.720> size<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.579> let<00:04:09.579> me<00:04:09.639> just<00:04:09.819> quickly<00:04:09.940> put

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
pocket size so let me just quickly put

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.240 
pocket size so let me just quickly put
these<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.599> there<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.870> well

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.190 

and<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.370> there<00:04:17.519> are<00:04:17.880> these<00:04:18.239> sweet<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.930> to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
and then there are these sweet on to

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.990 
and then there are these sweet on to
