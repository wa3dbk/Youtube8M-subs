00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.710
 hello and welcome to the ribs 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.700
 armor to talk about this beautiful vegetables 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.529
 what is broccoli 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.420
 it seems that the climate of the region 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.070
 Paimpolaise and the only ones are 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.080
 particularly favorable to its culture 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.970
 and to tell us about it and well it's 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.309
 exactly one of the broccoli producers 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.720
 begging the company to provide who will be able 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.390
 to entrust us with his production secrets 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.739
 hello patrick hello gilly hello 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.110
 so here we are in the middle of 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.820
 harvest yes we are in full period there 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.710
 for harvesting broccoli from 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.339
 spring so I let myself be told 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.510
 that this region around paimpol 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.059
 concentrated most of the production 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.580
 broccoli in which I suppose our 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.650
 climates the soil allows this culture 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.930
 promotes this culture there we have a 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.760
 temperate climate on the serghini sector 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.650
 very hot gel here do not have more than 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.180
 a few days a year sometimes 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.250
 yet we might think 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.630
 finally the north coast of brittany 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.190
 in any case this part is rather 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 to protect from bad weather she is 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.710
 protected from winter weather 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.570
 makes the proximity of the gulf stream this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.880
 hot current who precisely to whom comes 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.649
 warm the east and the edge band 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.789
 coastal so little amplitude termist 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.320
 that one of the temperatures that go down 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.689
 not too low in winter and that do not show 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.969
 not too summer either summer remains 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.689
 it can rarely exceed 25 degrees 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.900
 is his broccoli farts fits well 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.210
 adapt well 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.560
 it's temperature said me we talk about 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.580
 climate but is not that the customer there is 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 the soil at the site 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.470
 so here we are on limons 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.220
 wind who have excellent fertility 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.290
 that allows us to cultivate 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.720
 naturally plants like the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.190
 broccoli so what period does this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.320
 sowing what period is that 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.480
 you remember well recognized the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 broccoli there are two two campaigns the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.940
 spring season whose flanders 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.490
 during the month of April and we harvest them 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.090
 from June 20 to July 20, so about 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.790
 three months 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.320
 it's just 90 days of culture 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.510
 between them twenty ten days this is so 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.520
 that the very fast and tell you about 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.800
 two seasons so you replanted after 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.180
 there is the autumn season, that is to say 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.150
 we're going to replant but in others 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.860
 ground or a rotation history where we go 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.470
 we replant in the month of July to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 harvest in the month of October then you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.570
 do not have an interesting thing the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.340
 rotation 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.680
 that is, we can not cultivate 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.330
 two times in a row the same field with 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.480
 broccoli agronomically it can 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.590
 always change culture and we have to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720
 better culture this way 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 okay so I understood how that 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 is grown and but I would like 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.519
 know how it is collected since we 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500
 is in full and very strong that one 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.620
 go see my wife marie yvonne 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.300
 so the harvest is done by hand the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.989
 harvest is done manually there is a 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.470
 size to respect which is between 15 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.940
 and 18 cm and for that there is no such 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.580
 that the hand of the man that one can 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.690
 estimate the need to cut it or not 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 this for now 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.320
 what is the variety of broccoli that 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.730
 you cultivate one cultivates the parthenon that 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.010
 this is the parthenon why this 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.140
 variety because we are looking for 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.440
 broccoli they can go up to 800 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.350
 grams 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.110
 and especially it's a variety that has a 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.500
 very fine grain and that is excellent in 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.690
 bush 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.269
 OK, it's true that he is very pretty 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.709
 and as you say I guess it's 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.930
 a sign of quality to have 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.549
 well- green and well-sealed grains and the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.100
 finesse the bug of the gringo of the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.739
 quality and well done because I know 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.920
 that it's work to get that I 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.570
 please thank you now we will 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.670
 meet jérôme not network that is 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.470
 agronomist who will enlighten us on the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.540
 ground treatment traceability 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.420
 product and nutritional value 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.980
 of this package hello jérôme julie days 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.720
 so inevitably when we consume 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.180
 vegetables one wonders how 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.560
 these vegetables are they treated protect 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.889
 as for the bad ones 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.480
 herbs 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.790
 We use age-purpose techniques 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.989
 and hoeing that prevent 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.239
 the use of protective products 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.139
 then only manual treatments 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.970
 and mechanics 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.590
 no we can also used 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.910
 chemical treatments but for that 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.680
 we use products that are 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.409
 certified in organic farming 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.299
 okay so that's one we could say 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.940
 reasoned agriculture is this 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.820
 then we have almost a traceability 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.400
 complete patrick provides us with broccoli 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.710
 for that we have a plot we 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.900
 have codified his parcel and when the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.150
 patrick's product comes in to be sure 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.380
 I have them well the carrier gives the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.419
 code of his parcel that allows us 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.370
 to have a traceability to the field 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.620
 and we will also follow through 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.259
 cultural son all applications 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.789
 all the tillage all the 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.169
 mechanical means to use patrick 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.970
 throughout his culture 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.759
 you never let go of this little broccoli 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.620
 we laugh a lot 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.530
 how long of time I guess 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.930
 flows between the moment when the vegetable and 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.520
 harvested now and the moment she 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.460
 is sure I have on average we are 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.620
 between 4 and 8 hours between the moment 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.889
 he leaves the field and the moment he is 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.570
 frozen at -18 yes so that's really 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.210
 cooler what would I do more 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.349
 fresh and then the last thing that 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.820
 I'm interested in it's value 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.830
 product nutrition because I have 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.030
 always heard that all of 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.949
 crucifiers besides soul and in 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.610
 especially broccoli and is very good 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.500
 for health 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.120
 so our goal through the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.830
 deep freezing is to fix the whole 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.690
 nutritional qualities of broccoli 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.659
 especially vitamins including 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.760
 vitamins vitamin c vitamin b9 and 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.530
 preserve all the fiber aspect that is 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.300
 also very important on broccoli 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.760
 so finally if I understood correctly 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.830
 to get the best broccoli ya 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.979
 many factors but the main ones 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.229
 it's still the choice of the variety 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.460
 the perfect stage of harvest to follow 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.710
 every day so here it's really 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.360
 the farmer and finally the time that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.860
 flows between the harvest and the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.340
 freezing which must be the shortest 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.590
 possible 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.150
 thank you very much managed to silabu julie 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.070
 and I must say that I do not regret my 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.820
 trip because not only have I 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.710
 learned a lot 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.330
 I suppose too but in addition we have 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.419
 a beautiful view they are lucky 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.419
 his broccoli a little field
