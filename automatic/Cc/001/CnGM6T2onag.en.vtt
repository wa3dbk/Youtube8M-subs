00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
running across the front and then

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.520 
running across the front and then
there's<00:01:42.539> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.929> be<00:01:42.959> another<00:01:43.319> one<00:01:45.530> joining

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.430 

so<00:01:56.220> let's<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.610> started<00:01:57.440> ladies

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
so let's get started ladies

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.470 
so let's get started ladies
handkerchiefs<00:01:58.890> usually<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.240> multiple

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
handkerchiefs usually come in multiple

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.840 
handkerchiefs usually come in multiple
packages<00:02:01.230> but<00:02:02.010> you<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.610> careful

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
packages but you have to be careful

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
packages but you have to be careful
because<00:02:03.150> usually<00:02:03.630> there's<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.740> each

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
because usually there's just one of each

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.300 
because usually there's just one of each
design<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.870> need<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.620> each<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
design and you you need two of each so

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.790 
design and you you need two of each so
you<00:02:08.369> probably<00:02:08.490> have<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.450> order<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.350> packages

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you probably have to order two packages

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100 
you probably have to order two packages
again<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:11.940> an<00:02:12.209> excellent<00:02:12.630> opportunity

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
again this is an excellent opportunity

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.010 
again this is an excellent opportunity
to<00:02:13.590> share<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.190> your<00:02:14.490> friends<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.840> have

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
to share it with your friends so we have

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
to share it with your friends so we have
the<00:02:16.140> two<00:02:16.320> packages<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.700> match

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the two packages and then we can match

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.699 
the two packages and then we can match
up<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.180> patterns<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.400> would<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.880> one

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
up the patterns so this would be one

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.120 
up the patterns so this would be one
dress<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:23.760> would<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.180> another<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.130> so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
dress this would be another one and so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.210 
dress this would be another one and so
on<00:02:26.360> well<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.810> from<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.290> package<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.070> my

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.039 
made out of lace beautifully colored
fabrics<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.640> only<00:03:05.970> thing<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.450> they

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
fabrics the only thing is that they

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.180 
fabrics the only thing is that they
usually<00:03:07.950> not<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.600> precisely<00:03:09.600> made<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.530> there

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
usually not very precisely made so there

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.140 
usually not very precisely made so there
are<00:03:11.459> going<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.090> slight<00:03:12.870> variations<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
are going to be slight variations so I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.320

made my choice I'm going to be using

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.710 
made my choice I'm going to be using
this<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.080> here<00:03:19.910> first<00:03:20.910> thing<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.540> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
this one here first thing to do is to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.850 
this one here first thing to do is to
cut<00:03:22.049> out<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.470> little<00:03:22.590> tags

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.890 

you<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.760> watch<00:03:31.940> them<00:03:32.180> an<00:03:32.300> eye<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:32.480> them

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
you have to watch them an eye on them

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.010 
you have to watch them an eye on them
just<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.680> any<00:03:34.040> other<00:03:34.280> new<00:03:34.670> items<00:03:37.960> now<00:03:38.960> we

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
have to make sure that they match up the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.800 
have to make sure that they match up the
patterns<00:03:42.830> as<00:03:43.010> mirror<00:03:43.430> images<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.390> each<00:03:44.540> other

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
patterns as mirror images to each other

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.870 
patterns as mirror images to each other
so<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.590> going<00:03:45.770> to<00:03:45.890> be<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.250> front<00:03:46.580> now<00:03:46.820> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
so this is going to be the front now the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.390 
so this is going to be the front now the
front<00:03:47.360> theme<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.610> going<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.630> two<00:03:50.900> sides

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
front theme is going to be the two sides

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.360 
front theme is going to be the two sides
overlapping<00:03:52.400> each<00:03:52.850> other<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.920> will<00:03:55.160> be<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
overlapping each other this will be the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.720 
overlapping each other this will be the
top<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.630> will<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.320> bot<00:03:57.650> front<00:03:58.070> bottom<00:03:58.610> of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
top this will be the bot front bottom of

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.870 
top this will be the bot front bottom of
the<00:03:58.910> traps<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:03.410> are<00:04:03.470> going<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.740> be<00:04:03.920> making<00:04:04.520> the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
the traps we are going to be making the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.130 
the traps we are going to be making the
theme<00:04:06.040> two<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.280> half<00:04:07.490> inches<00:04:07.840> from<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> top

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
theme two and a half inches from the top

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.910 
theme two and a half inches from the top
so<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.250> measure<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.910> two<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.510> half<00:04:11.690> inches

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
so a measure of two and a half inches

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:25.750 
so a measure of two and a half inches
mark<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.160> with<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.430> pin<00:04:13.760> or<00:04:23.380> just<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> same<00:04:24.860> put

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
mark it with a pin or just the same put

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.390 
mark it with a pin or just the same put
in<00:04:25.910> another<00:04:26.180> pin<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.650> I'm<00:04:27.800> going<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.160> sit

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
in another pin and then I'm going to sit

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:56.490 
in another pin and then I'm going to sit
down<00:04:28.730> with<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.120> machine

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.170 

because<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.770> very<00:04:57.800> fine<00:04:58.280> fabric<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.030> have

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
because it's a very fine fabric you have

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:09.760 
because it's a very fine fabric you have
to<00:04:59.330> make<00:04:59.510> sure<00:04:59.540> that<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.290> stays<00:05:00.500> nice<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:09.560> we

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
the second one for that we're going to

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.460 
the second one for that we're going to
have<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.550> on<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:17.300> wrong<00:05:17.450> side<00:05:23.050> tidy<00:05:24.050> up<00:05:24.260> the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
have it on the wrong side tidy up the

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.130 
have it on the wrong side tidy up the
threads<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:24.980> it<00:05:27.790> on<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:29.330> wrong<00:05:29.510> side<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:30.020> the

fabric this is the top we know because

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.610 
fabric this is the top we know because
that's<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.910> two<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.300> half<00:05:35.510> inches<00:05:35.690> opening

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
that's the two and a half inches opening

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's the two and a half inches opening
for<00:05:36.890> the<00:05:37.010> front<00:05:37.570> right<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.870> this<00:05:39.140> is<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:40.850> back
