that's<00:01:21.060> amazing<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> steerer<00:01:22.049> speaker<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that's amazing the steerer speaker and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460 
that's amazing the steerer speaker and
digital<00:01:22.920> noise<00:01:23.040> cancellation<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.119> same<00:01:24.470> from

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
digital noise cancellation is same from

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
digital noise cancellation is same from
the<00:01:25.500> z2<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> c3<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> c3<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the z2 over here on the c3 so the c3 is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.270 
the z2 over here on the c3 so the c3 is
also<00:01:29.270> slimmer<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.710> shorter<00:01:32.100> than

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
also slimmer and a little shorter than

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
also slimmer and a little shorter than
the<00:01:32.460> z2<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.049> 7.5<00:01:34.710> millimeters

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the z2 and also it's 7.5 millimeters

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
the z2 and also it's 7.5 millimeters
thinner<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> z2<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.150> eight<00:01:36.509> point<00:01:36.750> two

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
thinner as the z2 is eight point two

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
thinner as the z2 is eight point two
millimeters<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:38.340> limit<00:01:38.640> or

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
millimeters it's like one limit or

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
millimeters it's like one limit or
different<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.240> unfortunately<00:01:40.229> fortunately

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
different so unfortunately fortunately

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.359 
different so unfortunately fortunately
at<00:01:41.460> disclaiming<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.720> z3<00:01:43.200> cases<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:44.009> rendered

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
at disclaiming the z3 cases has rendered

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
at disclaiming the z3 cases has rendered
a<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> reduction<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.450> battery<00:01:45.750> capacity

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a bit of reduction in battery capacity

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.980 
a bit of reduction in battery capacity
so<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> z3<00:01:46.890> has<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.759> 3000<00:01:48.240> 1,000,000<00:01:48.869> about

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so the z3 has a 3000 1,000,000 about

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
so the z3 has a 3000 1,000,000 about
battery<00:01:49.380> which<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.649> harm<00:01:50.070> Liam<00:01:50.310> power<00:01:50.430> less

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
battery which is harm Liam power less

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.530 
battery which is harm Liam power less
than<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> Xperia<00:01:51.270> z2<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.950> but<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.189> still

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
than the Xperia z2 and but you can still

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.359 
than the Xperia z2 and but you can still
expect<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.720> their<00:01:54.869> battery<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.799> I'll<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
expect to their battery so I'll see to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.880
