brand new products that skin physics

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.290 
brand new products that skin physics
have<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.720> released<00:00:22.369> it's<00:00:23.369> called<00:00:23.699> instant

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
have just released it's called instant

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
have just released it's called instant
FX<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.550> 11<00:00:27.300> unique<00:00:27.960> ingredients<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
FX and it has 11 unique ingredients that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
FX and it has 11 unique ingredients that
are<00:00:29.550> actually<00:00:29.970> absorbs<00:00:30.720> into<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> skin<00:00:31.259> via

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
are actually absorbs into the skin via

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.930 
are actually absorbs into the skin via
and<00:00:33.410> microwave<00:00:34.410> massage<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.280> vibration

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and microwave massage and vibration

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.630 
and microwave massage and vibration
technology<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> property

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
technology so this is this is a property

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.039 
technology so this is this is a property
so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.699> can<00:00:41.909> see<00:00:42.119> that<00:00:42.299> it's<00:00:42.479> silver<00:00:42.900> on

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.049 
so you can see that it's silver on

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.859 
so you can see that it's silver on
either<00:00:43.260> ends<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.979> end<00:00:44.580> with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> smaller

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:45.869 
either ends now the end with the smaller

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:48.079 
either ends now the end with the smaller
silver<00:00:46.409> part<00:00:46.650> that's<00:00:47.369> the<00:00:47.640> part<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
silver part that's the part that you

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.729 
silver part that's the part that you
take<00:00:48.330> off<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.900> can<00:00:49.049> see<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> there's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
take off so you can see that there's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
take off so you can see that there's
roll<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.339> beads<00:00:50.580> at<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.449> ends<00:00:51.750> there

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
roll the beads at the ends there

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
roll the beads at the ends there
multiple<00:00:52.229> roller<00:00:52.619> beads<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.339> product<00:00:53.699> comes

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
multiple roller beads the product comes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.820 
multiple roller beads the product comes
out<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.019> other<00:00:55.170> end<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.799> a

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
out there and on the other end is a

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.979 
out there and on the other end is a
button<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.229> you<00:00:58.229> press<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:59.220> this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.720> going

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
button that you press and this is going

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280 
button that you press and this is going
to<00:01:01.049> make<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> vibrate<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> hopefully<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to make it vibrate so hopefully you can

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.640 
to make it vibrate so hopefully you can
hear<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.860> vibrating<00:01:06.049> now<00:01:07.049> I'm<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> going

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
hear that vibrating now I'm just going

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
hear that vibrating now I'm just going
to<00:01:07.770> show<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> how<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.759> apply<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.420> I'm<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to show you how to apply it so I'm going

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
to show you how to apply it so I'm going
to<00:01:09.750> pour<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.320> right<00:01:10.619> eye<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.360> just

to pour it to my right eye and you just
squeeze<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> tiny<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.370> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:16.430> ingredients

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
squeeze a tiny bit of the ingredients

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.790 
squeeze a tiny bit of the ingredients
out<00:01:17.610> onto<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.120> eye<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.930> unless

this I so you can see if it makes a

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.810 
this I so you can see if it makes a
difference<00:01:40.110> between<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.370> left<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
difference between the left and the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.590 
difference between the left and the
right<00:01:42.090> eye<00:01:43.610> some<00:01:44.610> sort<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> massage<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> few
