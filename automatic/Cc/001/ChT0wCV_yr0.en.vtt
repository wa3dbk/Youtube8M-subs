00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.210
 let's say you have no rust on the car 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.100
 nor any chips that you do not 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.289
 like and you are ready to stick the car 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.020
 before we start pasting 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.050
 always we spend 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.450
 manually through the car wash 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.500
 impossible to clean out all the dirt and soups 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.230
 who are stuck in different villages they need 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.830
 remove only contactless sink 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.520
 Karcher after the car has passed 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.040
 we drive a sink and in the evening washed the car 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.739
 in the morning and already glue and because during the night 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.320
 all like these droplets dry up and and 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.830
 accordingly, the machine is already without water 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.790
 total released net ready for pasting 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.790
 after that you 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.130
 washed we do not degrease and normal 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 so degreaser it costs order 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.320
 there is 100 rubles and there is a small jar 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.080
 From the United States more liter for my fucking 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.900
 even 2 where you are almost half a liter is all 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.030
 liter on the usual and take degreased 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.730
 surface on many machines for example 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.080
 on 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.720
 milan drivers recently encountered 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.030
 so that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 the whole body is completely processed some 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 chemistry or wax is not understandable to all 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 the film does not necessarily stick 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.730
 check then like a harlequin film for then i 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.500
 also then show in the next video how 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.500
 check the stickiness and if there are any 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 bitumen stains which after three he too 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.150
 manifest we use that length 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.330
 she is different here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.730
 I can orsk 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.480
 if you find a reception take prem she and 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.610
 reach in general is the clay that 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.020
 cleans all dirt from the surface do 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.940
 and very smooth without scratching 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.430
 somewhere how to apply all too try 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.060
 from making a separate video 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.160
 how all this is done is completely ready 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.610
 to work and it remains only to glue 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.210
 film 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210
 until
