unbelievably<00:01:56.700> amazing<00:01:57.030> things<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.719> had<00:01:57.840> fire

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
unbelievably amazing things we had fire

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
unbelievably amazing things we had fire
from<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.500> distance<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.399> take<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.939> three

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
people in one hit and then you'd have

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
people in one hit and then you'd have
somebody<00:02:02.579> point-blank<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.329> front<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
shoot them in the head and you get a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
shoot them in the head and you get a
hitmarker<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.570> quite

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
hitmarker and that's really quite

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.290 
hitmarker and that's really quite
frustrating<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.649> used<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> remember<00:02:09.030> doing<00:02:09.149> a

I've<00:02:17.880> tried<00:02:18.270> everything<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:19.230> every<00:02:19.710> shotgun

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
I've tried everything with every shotgun

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.950 
I've tried everything with every shotgun
I've<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.520> every<00:02:20.850> shotgun<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.420> gold<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.840> I've

I've got every shotgun in gold and I've
got<00:02:22.170> damage<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:22.950> every<00:02:23.400> single<00:02:23.580> gun<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.210> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
got damage on every single gun and the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.260 
got damage on every single gun and the
model<00:02:25.350> 1887<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.550> probably<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> most

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
model 1887 is probably the most

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.180 
model 1887 is probably the most
inconsistent<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.260> me<00:02:28.410> every<00:02:28.860> other<00:02:28.890> one

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
inconsistent for me every other one

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.910 
inconsistent for me every other one
seems<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> job<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.570> model<00:02:30.840> 1887<00:02:31.440> doesn't

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
seems to do a job the model 1887 doesn't

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
seems to do a job the model 1887 doesn't
and<00:02:32.040> what's<00:02:32.280> annoying<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.060> when<00:02:33.540> you've<00:02:33.660> got

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
and what's annoying is when you've got

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.870 
and what's annoying is when you've got
things<00:02:34.020> like<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.410> striker<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.100> use<00:02:35.370> us<00:02:35.610> or

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
things like the striker the use us or

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300 
things like the striker the use us or
spammable<00:02:36.780> guns<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.740> generally<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
spammable guns can generally get a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.340 
spammable guns can generally get a
one-hit<00:02:38.760> ko<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.210> distance<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> that's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
one-hit ko from distance and that's

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
one-hit ko from distance and that's
quite<00:02:40.560> annoying<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.100> when<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.520> consider

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
quite annoying because when you consider

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.720 
quite annoying because when you consider
with<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> model<00:02:42.450> 1887<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.860> shoot<00:02:44.130> once<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
with the model 1887 you shoot once and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.000 
with the model 1887 you shoot once and
then<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.330> do<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> cowboy<00:02:46.200> click<00:02:46.830> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
then you have to do the cowboy click of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.560 
then you have to do the cowboy click of
the<00:02:47.040> chamber<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:47.910> pull<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.240> back<00:02:48.390> down

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the chamber and then pull it back down

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.630 
the chamber and then pull it back down
and<00:02:48.750> far<00:02:48.960> again<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.830> these<00:02:50.010> other<00:02:50.190> ones<00:02:50.430> it's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and far again with these other ones it's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640 
and far again with these other ones it's
bang<00:02:50.910> bang<00:02:51.270> bang<00:02:51.510> bang<00:02:51.750> bang<00:02:52.020> bang<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.470> there's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
bang bang bang bang bang bang so there's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.990 
bang bang bang bang bang bang so there's
plenty<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.790> sir

plenty there to back it up and it sir
it's<00:02:54.300> quite<00:02:54.600> frustrating<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.290> yeah<00:02:55.500> that's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it's quite frustrating but yeah that's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.830 
it's quite frustrating but yeah that's
the<00:02:56.340> game<00:02:56.490> play<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.820> background<00:02:56.970> enjoy

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the game play in the background enjoy

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
the game play in the background enjoy
like<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> sigh<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.250> back<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> dome

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
like a sigh going back to the dome

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.420 
like a sigh going back to the dome
finger<00:03:00.300> I've<00:03:00.990> never<00:03:01.380> liked<00:03:01.680> dome<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.160> always

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
finger I've never liked dome I always

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.970 
finger I've never liked dome I always
find<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.760> too<00:03:03.030> much<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.360> an<00:03:03.660> explosion<00:03:04.410> fest

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
find it too much of an explosion fest

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.080 
find it too much of an explosion fest
which<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:06.030> weird<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.900> had<00:03:07.320> my<00:03:07.590> best

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
which is weird because I had my best

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.699 
which is weird because I had my best
game<00:03:09.090> player<00:03:09.390> modern<00:03:09.870> warfare<00:03:10.050> 3<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.440> think

probably<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:11.490> best<00:03:11.730> game<00:03:12.030> players

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
probably one of my best game players

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.720 
probably one of my best game players
over<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.930> I'd<00:03:13.050> ever<00:03:13.290> posted<00:03:13.890> was<00:03:14.340> unknown

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
watching this probably hack and I

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.710 
watching this probably hack and I
understand<00:05:35.460> that<00:05:35.520> understand<00:05:36.090> people<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.599> it

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
and it's not very nice if you do do it

you<00:05:40.710> think<00:05:41.010> it's<00:05:41.160> harmless<00:05:41.430> but<00:05:41.729> it<00:05:41.820> is<00:05:41.940> quite

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
you think it's harmless but it is quite

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
annoying and I've been hacked to the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.190 
annoying and I've been hacked to the
degree<00:05:44.940> where<00:05:45.270> I've<00:05:45.389> actually<00:05:45.570> been<00:05:45.810> kicked

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
degree where I've actually been kicked

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.140 
degree where I've actually been kicked
offline<00:05:46.500> and<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.460> couldn't<00:05:47.669> get<00:05:47.789> back<00:05:47.970> online

was<00:05:50.729> one<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.120> those<00:05:51.210> instances<00:05:51.720> where<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.169> think

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
was one of those instances where I think

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.290
