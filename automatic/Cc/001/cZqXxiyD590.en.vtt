00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 is the only Mexican gun that is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.490
 simple action 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.129
 which is from 1 to 0 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.289
 and what is handmade in the 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.180
 that officials with high pride 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.520
 Gabriel caliber in his weapons factory 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.890
 Trejo in ZacatlÃ¡n talks to us about this 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.050
 dynasty of gunsmiths in his family that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.289
 traces back to three generations a 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.900
 increase gabon and between angels that was 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.780
 market or corner or the Carrancistas 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.790
 he was also very fond of shooting 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.670
 to white 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 my father joined the cause or with his 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.780
 dad and his brothers who were the ones 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.120
 they founded the factory 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.370
 Gabriel's father initially started 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.350
 to make weapons secretly but 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.110
 when Gabriel's grandfather discovered it 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.769
 instead of scolding him he advised him 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.050
 first thing I had to solve was how 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.909
 make striped barrel of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.960
 pistols if not it was not going to be possible that 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.960
 your gun will work 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 without having studied engineering the trejo 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.329
 besides making weapons they also design 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.299
 and assemble the machines for their 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.759
 elaboration this crazy machine are 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.200
 some of which are still functioning 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.200
 after several decades 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 the first gun made by the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.030
 gabriel's father was totally 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030
 automatic 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.210
 the weapons then the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.660
 manufacture of automatic pistols and 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.450
 something even more categorical happened not 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.120
 prohibit the manufacture and sale of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.330
 pistols and closes its doors arms 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.370
 trejo 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.890
 but gabriel living up to the saying 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.350
 where the eye puts the bullet and in the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 2010 again request authorization 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.390
 government there they tell us that we already 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 we had taken that they even 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.040
 they had searched or tried to search for 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.470
 see if we are interested in going back to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 make weapons 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.020
 now they are developing several 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:17.390
 models is a 380 380 caliber 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.390
 of 9 shots with a capacity of 13 shots 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 louis caliber 22 long rifle this is a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 type 911 that was of the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.710
 a model of the col tm the pistols are 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.900
 totally made of steel which allows 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.120
 its repair is much simpler in 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.400
 comparison to other weapons manufactured with 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 alloys this has aroused the interest 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.710
 from different countries in Latin America and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.940
 completely local now in plans 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.550
 export to meet that demand for
