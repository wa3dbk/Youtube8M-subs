00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
next day he said that it was ninety-nine

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
next day he said that it was ninety-nine
percent<00:00:52.829> sure<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> missing

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
percent sure that it was the missing

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
percent sure that it was the missing
plane<00:00:55.649> that's<00:00:56.460> interesting<00:00:57.000> since<00:00:57.180> they

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
plane that's interesting since they

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.670 
plane that's interesting since they
hadn't<00:00:57.600> recovered<00:00:57.870> anything<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
hadn't recovered anything how could it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.060 
hadn't recovered anything how could it
be<00:00:58.770> 99%<00:00:59.430> sure<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> same<00:00:59.910> plane<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
be 99% sure it was the same plane I

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
be 99% sure it was the same plane I
don't<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.129> maybe<00:01:03.059> someone<00:01:03.449> told<00:01:03.570> him<00:01:03.660> say

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
don't know maybe someone told him say

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
happens to the papers filed almost a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
month after the crash okay what was on

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.530 
month after the crash okay what was on
those<00:02:31.599> papers<00:02:32.049> if<00:02:32.200> they<00:02:32.230> were<00:02:32.409> really<00:02:32.829> there<00:02:33.040> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
those papers if they were really there I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.940 
those papers if they were really there I
led<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.659> believe<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.500> stayed<00:02:35.769> on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
led to believe that the just stayed on

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
led to believe that the just stayed on
the<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.459> 60-degree<00:02:36.879> slope<00:02:37.180> covered<00:02:37.659> by
