00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey there let's draw a diamond ring

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.330 
hey there let's draw a diamond ring
alright<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:06.330> we<00:00:06.359> go<00:00:06.710> we're<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.040> start

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
alright here we go we're going to start

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
alright here we go we're going to start
out<00:00:08.519> with<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.059> straight<00:00:09.599> line<00:00:11.059> underneath<00:00:12.059> that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
out with a straight line underneath that

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.180 
out with a straight line underneath that
straight<00:00:12.840> line<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.679> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.040> make

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
straight line we are going to make

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.609 
straight line we are going to make
another<00:00:14.549> straight<00:00:15.059> line<00:00:15.330> only<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
another straight line only it's going to

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.730 
another straight line only it's going to
be<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:17.010> bit<00:00:17.279> longer<00:00:18.289> we<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
be a little bit longer we are going to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.990 
be a little bit longer we are going to
attach<00:00:20.210> those<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.660> lines<00:00:22.699> with<00:00:23.699> another

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
attach those two lines with another

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
attach those two lines with another
straight<00:00:24.359> line<00:00:25.910> now<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.289> end<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
straight line now at this end at this

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.030 
straight line now at this end at this
end<00:00:29.910> we're<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> come<00:00:30.990> down<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:34.710> lines

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
end we're going to come down with lines

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.840 
end we're going to come down with lines
just<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.110> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:38.070> bottom<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.610> these

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
just like that at the bottom of these

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.290 
just like that at the bottom of these
two<00:00:39.149> lines<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> attach<00:00:40.739> those

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
two lines we are going to attach those

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
two lines we are going to attach those
with<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> shape<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> looks<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
with the shape that looks like this it's

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
with the shape that looks like this it's
a<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:45.050> long<00:00:46.280> oval<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.079> then<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
a very long oval and then we're going to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
a very long oval and then we're going to
put<00:00:49.770> another<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.430> only<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.149> one's<00:00:51.420> even

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
put another one only this one's even

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
put another one only this one's even
going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.770> longer<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
going to be a little bit longer and it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.930 
going to be a little bit longer and it's
going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> attach<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.940> now

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
going to attach to the first one now

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.939 
going to attach to the first one now
this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> tricky<00:00:57.809> part<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.620> need<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this is a tricky part because we need to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.490 
this is a tricky part because we need to
get<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.850> actual<00:01:00.510> circle<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
get the actual circle going and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.280 
get the actual circle going and
sometimes<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.190> difficult<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:04.129> make<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
sometimes it's difficult to make a

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.359 
sometimes it's difficult to make a
circle<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.770> okay

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
circle but that's okay

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969 
circle but that's okay
you<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> practice<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you just have to practice so we have a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.260 
you just have to practice so we have a
circle<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.840> inside<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.380> circle

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
circle and then inside that circle

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
circle and then inside that circle
you're<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:15.869> another<00:01:15.900> circle<00:01:16.770> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you're going to make another circle this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
you're going to make another circle this
is<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> actual<00:01:17.909> ring<00:01:18.630> part<00:01:20.930> put

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is going to be the actual ring part put

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.520 
is going to be the actual ring part put
two<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.409> lines<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.159> each<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
two little lines on each side just like

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.609 
two little lines on each side just like
that<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that now we're going to go back up to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.359 
that now we're going to go back up to
the<00:01:28.740> diamond<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> put<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
the diamond and we are going to put a

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.520 
the diamond and we are going to put a
series<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.380> inside<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.350> up

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
series of these inside so we just go up

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
series of these inside so we just go up
and<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.970> down

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and down up and down

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
and down up and down
until<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> run<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> room<00:01:42.770> perfect

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
until you run out of room perfect

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.280 
until you run out of room perfect
now<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.440> you're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.049> let's<00:01:49.049> put

now from there you're going to let's put

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
now from there you're going to let's put
a<00:01:49.320> dot<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.400> we<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.700> where<00:01:51.060> we're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a dot right here so we know where we're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
a dot right here so we know where we're
going<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.220> is
