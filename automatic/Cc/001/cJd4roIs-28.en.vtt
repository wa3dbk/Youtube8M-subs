hey everyone's calm preggers they
already<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.730> pilot<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.360> so<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.620> part

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
already a pilot here so this is part

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.349 
already a pilot here so this is part
three<00:00:05.040> or<00:00:05.130> three<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.400> mini<00:00:05.609> series<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.270> did

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
three or three of mini series that I did

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.169 
three or three of mini series that I did
this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.379> landing<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.429> multi-engine<00:00:08.849> aircraft

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
this is landing a multi-engine aircraft

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.839 
this is landing a multi-engine aircraft
at<00:00:09.510> our<00:00:09.630> single-engine<00:00:10.200> operation<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.040> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
at our single-engine operation now this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
at our single-engine operation now this
video<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.450> kind<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.870> misnomer<00:00:13.080> because<00:00:13.500> it's

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
video is kind of a misnomer because it's

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.620 
video is kind of a misnomer because it's
supposed<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.549> highlighted<00:00:15.299> playing<00:00:15.509> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
supposed to be highlighted playing in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.410 
supposed to be highlighted playing in
single-engine<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.670> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> watched<00:00:18.029> part

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
single-engine but if you watched part

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.890 
single-engine but if you watched part
two<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.350> series<00:00:19.880> I<00:00:20.880> told<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.869> I

two of this series I told you that I
lost<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.410> video<00:00:22.710> footage<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.760> was

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
lost the video footage that I was

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.269 
lost the video footage that I was
complaining<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.750> part<00:00:24.960> 2<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> 3<00:00:25.380> so

this<00:00:26.820> video<00:00:27.090> right<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
this video right here is going to be a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
this video right here is going to be a
multi-engine<00:00:29.820> landing<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.679> going

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
multi-engine landing but I'm just going

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
multi-engine landing but I'm just going
to<00:00:31.949> describe<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.120> voice-over<00:00:33.480> how

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to describe to you on the voice-over how

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
to describe to you on the voice-over how
I<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.559> through<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.980> single-engine<00:00:35.880> landing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 

a<00:00:39.020> really<00:00:40.020> important<00:00:40.410> thing<00:00:40.560> to<00:00:40.590> remember

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a really important thing to remember

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.190 
a really important thing to remember
when<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.400> multi-engine<00:00:41.790> aircraft

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
when you're in a multi-engine aircraft

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.690 
when you're in a multi-engine aircraft
flying<00:00:43.200> single-engine<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.160> trying<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.490> land

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
flying single-engine and trying to land

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.840 
flying single-engine and trying to land
it<00:00:44.880> is<00:00:45.300> conservation<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.350> energy<00:00:46.640> now<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it is conservation of energy now what I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.400 
it is conservation of energy now what I
mean<00:00:48.090> by<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.260> coming

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
mean by that is that when you're coming

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.530 
mean by that is that when you're coming
in<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.010> final<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> save

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
in on final you're gonna want to save

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.870 
in on final you're gonna want to save
the<00:00:52.140> flaps<00:00:52.470> and<00:00:52.950> your<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.580> mean<00:00:53.640> by

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
the flaps and your that what I mean by

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.000 
the flaps and your that what I mean by
that<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.360> put<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.720> at<00:00:55.380> your

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that is don't put them down at your

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.299 
that is don't put them down at your
normal<00:00:56.420> points<00:00:57.420> during<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.440> traffic<00:00:58.980> pattern

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
normal points during the traffic pattern

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.280 
normal points during the traffic pattern
so<00:00:59.970> you're<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> wait<00:01:00.630> until<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
so you're gonna want to wait until the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.620 
so you're gonna want to wait until the
runway<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.920> made<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> mean<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
runway is made and what I mean by that

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.560 
runway is made and what I mean by that
is<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.680> you're<00:01:04.920> coming<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.370> on<00:01:05.460> final<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
is that if you're coming in on final and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
is that if you're coming in on final and
you<00:01:06.600> happen<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.320> doubt<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.130> dual<00:01:08.400> engine

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you happen to have a doubt a dual engine

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.999 
you happen to have a doubt a dual engine
failure<00:01:08.940> then<00:01:09.660> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.870> still<00:01:10.260> glide<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
failure then you can still glide to the

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.210 
failure then you can still glide to the
airport<00:01:11.490> without<00:01:12.330> having<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:13.220> erratic

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
airport without having to do erratic

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
airport without having to do erratic
movement<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.119> anything<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:16.259> normally<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.720> my

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
movement or anything so normally when my

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
movement or anything so normally when my
instructor<00:01:19.170> gives<00:01:19.380> me<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.890> engine<00:01:20.430> failure<00:01:20.729> on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
instructor gives me a engine failure on

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
instructor gives me a engine failure on
landing<00:01:21.920> what<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> wait<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.670> put

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
landing what you wait to do is you put

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.520 
landing what you wait to do is you put
flaps<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.479> degree<00:01:24.720> there's<00:01:24.930> three<00:01:25.229> degrees

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
flaps one degree there's three degrees

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
flaps one degree there's three degrees
or<00:01:25.950> three<00:01:26.340> notches<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.910> flaps<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
or three notches of flaps on this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
or three notches of flaps on this
aircraft<00:01:27.630> normally<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.619> put<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
aircraft normally we put it to the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
aircraft normally we put it to the
approach<00:01:29.550> setting<00:01:30.119> during<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.690> base<00:01:30.899> leg<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
approach setting during the base leg and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
approach setting during the base leg and
that's<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> keep<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.149> slowed<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.390> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that's just to keep it slowed down so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
that's just to keep it slowed down so
you're<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.259> coming<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.360> 110<00:01:36.360> knots

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you're not gonna coming in at 110 knots

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
you're not gonna coming in at 110 knots
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> airport<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.410> then<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.649> just<00:01:37.800> get<00:01:37.890> out

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in the airport and then you just get out

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.430 
in the airport and then you just get out
of<00:01:38.040> control<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.759> float<00:01:39.060> forever<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.320> all

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
of control and you float forever and all

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.740 
of control and you float forever and all
that<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.800> stuff<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:42.630> you're

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that kind of stuff so really you're

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
that kind of stuff so really you're
gonna<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.110> wait<00:01:43.289> until<00:01:43.710> you're<00:01:44.069> about

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
gonna want to wait until you're about

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
gonna want to wait until you're about
half<00:01:44.729> mile<00:01:45.030> final<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.410> of<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.560> judgment

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
half mile final it's kind of a judgment

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.680 
half mile final it's kind of a judgment
call<00:01:47.130> based<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.670> fast<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
call based on how fast you're going and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.290 
call based on how fast you're going and
how<00:01:49.100> short<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.490> base<00:01:50.700> turn<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.149> gonna

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
how short of a base turn you're gonna

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.730 
how short of a base turn you're gonna
make<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.929> right<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:52.319> in<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.500> video

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
make so like right here in the video

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.650 
make so like right here in the video
this<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.179> early<00:01:54.450> for

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
this would be a little bit early for

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.080 
this would be a little bit early for
full<00:01:54.869> flaps<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.789> said<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
full flaps but you know like I said it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:09.020 
full flaps but you know like I said it
depends

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.280 

right<00:02:10.030> about<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.360> here's<00:02:10.660> where<00:02:10.960> I'll<00:02:11.110> put

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
right about and here's where I'll put

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.950 
right about and here's where I'll put
full<00:02:11.590> flaps<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.100> because<00:02:12.550> at<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.240> point<00:02:13.570> the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
full flaps in because at this point the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.140 
full flaps in because at this point the
runway<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.350> made<00:02:14.650> if<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.220> single-engine

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
runway is made if I have single-engine

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.880 
runway is made if I have single-engine
or<00:02:16.330> even<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.750> dual<00:02:17.020> engine<00:02:17.260> failure

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
or even a dual engine failure

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.130 
or even a dual engine failure
I<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.490> still<00:02:18.940> glide<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.990> runway

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
I can still glide down to the runway

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.160 
I can still glide down to the runway
safely<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.010> land<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> plane<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:22.990> this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
safely and land the plane now on this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.070 
safely and land the plane now on this
landing<00:02:23.530> here<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.600> actually<00:02:25.600> definitely<00:02:25.750> kept

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
landing here I actually definitely kept

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.020 
landing here I actually definitely kept
the<00:02:26.170> power<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.340> too<00:02:27.490> long

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the power in a little too long

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.760 
the power in a little too long
try<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.570> make<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.870> soft<00:02:29.080> landing<00:02:29.290> since<00:02:29.590> we

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
try to make it a soft landing since we

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.290 
try to make it a soft landing since we
have<00:02:29.950> three<00:02:30.190> people<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.730> lot<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.940> fuel<00:02:31.209> on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
have three people and a lot of fuel on

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.480 
have three people and a lot of fuel on
board<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:32.230> what<00:02:32.500> ended<00:02:32.709> up<00:02:32.800> happening<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
board but what ended up happening is I

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.430 
board but what ended up happening is I
floated<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.030> little<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.450> too<00:02:34.600> far<00:02:34.810> past<00:02:34.840> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
floated a little bit too far past a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.199 
floated a little bit too far past a
thousand-foot<00:02:35.920> markers<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.490> start<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> let

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
thousand-foot markers and start to let

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.540 
thousand-foot markers and start to let
me<00:02:37.330> know<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.160> checker<00:02:39.370> I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
me know that because on the checker I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.460 
me know that because on the checker I
that<00:02:39.850> would<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> bus<00:02:40.870> because<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.350> only

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
that would be a bus because you only

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.880 
that would be a bus because you only
have<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:41.800> 200<00:02:42.160> feet

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890

any<00:02:51.890> landing<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.579> walk<00:02:52.790> away<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
any landing we can walk away as the

any landing we can walk away as the
