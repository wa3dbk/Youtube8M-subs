short straw and there's a chance we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.650 
short straw and there's a chance we
could<00:01:22.040> divert<00:01:22.460> all<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:22.940> liquid<00:01:23.479> magma

away from our chamber and we literally

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.890 
away from our chamber and we literally
like<00:01:25.430> pulling<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.760> plug<00:01:26.210> on<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.360> bathtub<00:01:26.720> no
