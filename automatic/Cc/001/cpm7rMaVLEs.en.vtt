00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
each of the bubbles the next step will

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.939 
each of the bubbles the next step will
be<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.129> take<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.760> white<00:01:00.600> sheet<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.410> paper<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
add this to your project what this does

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399 
add this to your project what this does
is<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.159> adds<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.909> different<00:01:54.390> texture<00:01:54.899> sort<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
is this adds a different texture sort of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
is this adds a different texture sort of
like<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> race<00:01:55.799> texture<00:01:56.659> last<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:57.930> least

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
like a race texture last but not least

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
like a race texture last but not least
let's<00:01:58.409> try<00:01:58.619> some<00:01:58.829> Stamper<00:01:59.219> art<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.850> right

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
let's try some Stamper art all right
