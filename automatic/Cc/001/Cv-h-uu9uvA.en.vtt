dispensing system quite a while back
it's<00:00:37.920> still<00:00:38.280> working<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.940> still<00:00:39.210> use<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's still working we still use it on a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's still working we still use it on a
regular<00:00:40.079> basis<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.920> play<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> the

regular basis when we play on the
multiplayer<00:00:41.850> server<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:43.079> halfway

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
multiplayer server it's about halfway

so<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.120> guys<00:00:51.300> did<00:00:51.539> watch

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so as you know if you guys did watch

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.920 
so as you know if you guys did watch
that<00:00:51.960> video<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.949> seen<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> i<00:00:53.930> said

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that video or you have seen it i said

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.180 
that video or you have seen it i said
during<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.320> video<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> i<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
during that video that i would be

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
during that video that i would be
installing<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.239> destination<00:00:57.960> selection<00:00:58.829> are

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
installing a destination selection are

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.270 
installing a destination selection are
like<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> switching<00:01:00.390> type<00:01:00.780> station<00:01:01.289> next<00:01:02.190> door

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
like a switching type station next door

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
like a switching type station next door
well<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> notice<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.930> track<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.500> now

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
well if you notice the track has now

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.880 
well if you notice the track has now
been<00:01:04.860> rerouted<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.170> video<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.619> used<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
been rerouted in that video it used to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
been rerouted in that video it used to
come<00:01:08.130> pass<00:01:08.460> across<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> front<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
come pass across the front of this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
come pass across the front of this
building<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> doesn't<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
building and now it doesn't do that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
building and now it doesn't do that
anymore<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> another<00:01:13.049> building

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
anymore and we have another building

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
anymore and we have another building
outside<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.400> guess<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
outside so guess what it now has a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.160 
outside so guess what it now has a
switching<00:01:16.650> station<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.750> come<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:18.960> here

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
switching station so we come over here

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.520 
switching station so we come over here
as<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.700> track<00:01:21.090> comes<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:22.380> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
as you can see the track comes out of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
as you can see the track comes out of
the<00:01:22.590> bottom<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> used<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> except

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the bottom like it used to except

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
the bottom like it used to except
instead<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> left<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> goes<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
instead of going to the left it goes to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
instead of going to the left it goes to
the<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.909> swoops<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.420> behind<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the right it swoops back behind the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
the right it swoops back behind the
building<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:30.000> our

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
building here and goes into our

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
building here and goes into our
automated<00:01:31.049> switching<00:01:31.500> station<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.759> i<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
automated switching station so i just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.569 
automated switching station so i just
put<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> together<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> guys<00:01:35.130> want<00:01:35.400> i

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
put this together and if you guys want i

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
put this together and if you guys want i
will<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> full-on<00:01:36.540> build<00:01:37.140> video<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
will do a full-on build video but it is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.260 
will do a full-on build video but it is
pretty<00:01:38.820> simple<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> didn't<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pretty simple so I mean I didn't want to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
pretty simple so I mean I didn't want to
go<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.509> anything<00:01:42.689> complicated<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.649> don't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
go for anything complicated we don't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
go for anything complicated we don't
have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> large<00:01:44.579> server<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have a large server here there's not a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.039 
have a large server here there's not a
lot<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> people<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> play<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:48.750> wasn't

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
lot of people to play on it so it wasn't

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.820 
lot of people to play on it so it wasn't
really<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.680> give<00:01:49.799> an<00:01:49.890> issue

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
really that they give an issue

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.130 
really that they give an issue
but<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:51.670> is<00:01:51.760> what<00:01:51.910> we've<00:01:52.030> got<00:01:52.240> we<00:01:52.930> have

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
but so this is what we've got we have

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.100 
but so this is what we've got we have
basically<00:01:53.680> three<00:01:54.180> destinations<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.900> can<00:01:56.020> be

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
basically three destinations that can be

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.620 
basically three destinations that can be
selected<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:56.890> thing<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.760> buttons<00:01:58.480> of

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
selected on this thing the buttons of

nor<00:02:04.840> latch<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.730> can<00:02:06.880> see<00:02:06.910> it's<00:02:07.150> right

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
nor latch and as you can see it's right

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.810 
nor latch and as you can see it's right
here<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.320> vertical<00:02:08.770> RS<00:02:09.220> nor<00:02:09.369> latch<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:09.760> I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
here it's a vertical RS nor latch and I

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.640 
here it's a vertical RS nor latch and I
did<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.060> because<00:02:10.240> as<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.110> can<00:02:11.230> see<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
did this because as you can see this is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.070 
did this because as you can see this is
very<00:02:11.860> very<00:02:11.950> compact<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.760> fact<00:02:13.240> if<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
very very compact in fact if in the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.020 
very very compact in fact if in the
future<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.440> wanted<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.980> add<00:02:15.220> another<00:02:15.580> couple

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
future I wanted to add another couple

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
future I wanted to add another couple
destinations<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.720> could<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.170> fact<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
destinations I could in fact do that and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.370 
destinations I could in fact do that and
so<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.600> see<00:02:19.780> over<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:19.960> we've<00:02:20.350> got

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so as you can see over here we've got

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.340 
so as you can see over here we've got
two<00:02:21.090> two<00:02:22.090> destinations<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:22.960> way<00:02:23.140> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
two two destinations going this way and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.110 
two two destinations going this way and
then<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> far<00:02:24.310> end<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
then one going at the far end and the

of<00:02:33.040> show<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.250> guys<00:02:33.459> how<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.850> works<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.590> come

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
of show you guys how it works if we come

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540 
of show you guys how it works if we come
over<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.860> zoom<00:02:38.860> down<00:02:39.070> through<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
over here and zoom down through the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.420 
over here and zoom down through the
station<00:02:42.030> open<00:02:43.440> station<00:02:44.440> door<00:02:44.620> when<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.400> come

station open station door when you come

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970 
station open station door when you come
in<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:46.080> there<00:02:47.080> are<00:02:47.230> three<00:02:47.440> places<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
in here there are three places on the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.340 
in here there are three places on the
wall<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.430> course<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.360> server<00:02:49.690> isn't<00:02:50.050> that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
wall of course this server isn't that

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.160 
wall of course this server isn't that
big<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.890> said<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.580> haven't<00:02:51.910> really

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
big like I said and we haven't really

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.110 
big like I said and we haven't really
expanded<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> track<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.850> other<00:02:55.000> two

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
expanded the track for the other two

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.900 
expanded the track for the other two
stations<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:56.080> those<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:56.920> still<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.400> however

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
stations so those are still like however

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.660 
stations so those are still like however
we<00:02:58.180> do<00:02:58.300> have<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.890> tree<00:03:00.070> village<00:03:00.220> which<00:03:00.550> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
we do have the tree village which I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420 
we do have the tree village which I
showed<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.030> guys<00:03:01.180> before<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:03.190> have<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
showed you guys before and we have the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.770 
showed you guys before and we have the
lever<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.000> we<00:03:04.120> poked<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.510> button

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
lever in here so we poked that button

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.259 
lever in here so we poked that button
that<00:03:05.560> illuminates<00:03:06.489> which<00:03:06.670> tells<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.120> that

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
that illuminates which tells you that

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.699 
that illuminates which tells you that
this<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> destination<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.470> you'll<00:03:08.620> be

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
this is the destination that you'll be

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.890 
this is the destination that you'll be
going<00:03:08.860> towards<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:10.180> come<00:03:10.480> over<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
going towards we come over to the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.170 
going towards we come over to the
minecart<00:03:11.320> just<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.709> normal<00:03:12.030> poke<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
minecart just like normal poke the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.900 
minecart just like normal poke the
button<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.660> off<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.230> go<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:15.190> come<00:03:15.370> around<00:03:15.519> here

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
button and off we go we come around here

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.970 
button and off we go we come around here
we<00:03:16.420> come<00:03:16.570> through<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.989> station<00:03:17.380> here<00:03:17.680> and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
we come through the station here and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
we come through the station here and
it's<00:03:18.640> kind<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.850> kind<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.090> glitch<00:03:19.269> around<00:03:19.570> yeah

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
it's kind of kind of glitch around yeah

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.170 
it's kind of kind of glitch around yeah
there<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.350> go<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.430> that's<00:03:21.640> pretty<00:03:21.880> much<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
there we go so that's pretty much it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.679 
there we go so that's pretty much it
it<00:03:23.900> does<00:03:24.560> its<00:03:24.739> thing<00:03:24.939> it<00:03:25.939> switches<00:03:26.239> us<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.599> the

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
it does its thing it switches us to the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.770 
it does its thing it switches us to the
destination<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.469> destination<00:03:27.500> huh<00:03:28.310> yeah<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
destination the destination huh yeah the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.130 
destination the destination huh yeah the
destination<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.469> we'd<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.069> and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
destination that we'd like to go to and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.569 
destination that we'd like to go to and
that's<00:03:33.140> about<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.409> after<00:03:34.129> it's<00:03:34.250> done<00:03:34.370> it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
that's about it after it's done it

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.780 
that's about it after it's done it
resets<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.359> all<00:03:35.930> as<00:03:36.079> well<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:37.040> only<00:03:37.579> real

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
resets and all as well the only real

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.309 
resets and all as well the only real
thing<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.209> think<00:03:38.329> is<00:03:38.629> kind<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.930> cool<00:03:39.049> about

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
thing that I think is kind of cool about

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.750 
thing that I think is kind of cool about
this<00:03:39.530> whole<00:03:39.709> setup<00:03:39.950> is<00:03:40.159> the<00:03:40.219> fact<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.579> it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
this whole setup is the fact that it's

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.610 
this whole setup is the fact that it's
incredibly<00:03:41.299> compact<00:03:41.840> as<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.230> can<00:03:42.349> see<00:03:42.500> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
incredibly compact as you can see it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.009 
incredibly compact as you can see it
does<00:03:42.769> not<00:03:42.920> take<00:03:43.189> up<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.400> lot<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.579> space<00:03:43.879> I<00:03:44.180> mean

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
does not take up a lot of space I mean

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.530 
does not take up a lot of space I mean
most<00:03:45.889> of<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.189> is<00:03:46.400> like<00:03:46.790> these<00:03:47.030> little<00:03:47.209> bridge

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
most of this is like these little bridge

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.899 
most of this is like these little bridge
type<00:03:48.139> things<00:03:48.500> over<00:03:48.799> here<00:03:49.010> are<00:03:49.280> for<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.579> reset

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
type things over here are for the reset

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.759 
type things over here are for the reset
switches<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.540> I'm<00:03:50.629> sure<00:03:51.049> there's<00:03:51.439> somebody

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
switches and I'm sure there's somebody

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.369 
switches and I'm sure there's somebody
out<00:03:52.099> there<00:03:52.129> who<00:03:52.459> has<00:03:52.609> a<00:03:52.639> better<00:03:52.849> method<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:54.260> was

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
out there who has a better method it was

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.339 
out there who has a better method it was
a<00:03:54.409> little<00:03:54.680> bit<00:03:54.889> more<00:03:56.230> experienced<00:03:57.230> of

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
a little bit more experienced of

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.559 
a little bit more experienced of
redstone<00:03:57.680> than<00:03:58.069> myself<00:03:58.329> probably<00:03:59.329> has<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
redstone than myself probably has a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.210 
redstone than myself probably has a
better<00:03:59.629> method<00:03:59.930> for<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.319> but<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.500> don't<00:04:00.829> so

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
better method for it but I don't so

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.640 
better method for it but I don't so
that's<00:04:01.549> what<00:04:01.700> we<00:04:01.819> didn't<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.260> as<00:04:03.379> you<00:04:03.409> can<00:04:03.530> see

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
that's what we didn't so as you can see

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.319 
that's what we didn't so as you can see

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
reset if I hug that button we can jump

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.789 
reset if I hug that button we can jump

destination right there look at that and
of<00:04:22.070> course<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.430> did<00:04:22.580> reset<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.300> as<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:23.720> can<00:04:23.840> see

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
of course it did reset so as you can see

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.550 
of course it did reset so as you can see
we<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.550> basic<00:04:26.180> setup<00:04:26.479> of<00:04:26.599> this<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.139> I

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
we have the basic setup of this and I

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.750 
we have the basic setup of this and I
guess<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:27.979> just<00:04:28.130> go<00:04:28.250> ahead<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:28.520> show<00:04:28.729> you

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
guess I can just go ahead and show you

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.370 
guess I can just go ahead and show you
guys<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.030> little<00:04:29.240> bit<00:04:29.449> of<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:30.050> show<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.289> a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
guys a little bit of it I can show you a

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.310 
guys a little bit of it I can show you a
full<00:04:30.650> build<00:04:30.860> video<00:04:31.159> if<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.430> want<00:04:32.139> just<00:04:33.139> have

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
full build video if you want just have

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.800 
full build video if you want just have
to<00:04:33.409> let<00:04:33.500> me<00:04:33.620> know<00:04:33.740> anyway<00:04:34.699> so<00:04:35.000> we<00:04:35.210> have<00:04:35.389> you

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
know each of these has an RS nor latch

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.790 
know each of these has an RS nor latch
as<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:38.900> see<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.260> right<00:04:39.470> here<00:04:39.530> is

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
as you can see this right here is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.659 
as you can see this right here is
actually<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:41.800> part<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.039> illuminates<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
actually the part that illuminates the

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.310 
actually the part that illuminates the
actual<00:04:44.120> redstone<00:04:44.510> torch<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:44.990> other<00:04:45.139> side

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
actual redstone torch on the other side

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.089 
actual redstone torch on the other side
of<00:04:45.349> the<00:04:45.470> wall<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.940> then<00:04:46.940> these<00:04:47.870> right<00:04:48.530> here<00:04:48.560> or

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
of the wall and then these right here or

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.820 
of the wall and then these right here or
hook<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.490> buttons<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:51.289> we<00:04:51.409> have<00:04:51.500> an<00:04:51.620> RS

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
hook to the buttons and so we have an RS

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.940 
hook to the buttons and so we have an RS
nor<00:04:52.009> latch<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.460> comes<00:04:52.639> through<00:04:52.909> here

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
nor latch that comes through here

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.640 
nor latch that comes through here
and<00:04:54.310> it's<00:04:54.970> kind<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.240> right<00:04:55.480> here<00:04:55.690> compact<00:04:56.500> it

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
and it's kind of right here compact it

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.600 
and it's kind of right here compact it
in<00:04:56.800> when<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:57.790> RS<00:04:58.480> nor<00:04:58.630> latch<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.220> or<00:05:00.220> when

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
in when this RS nor latch is on or when

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.090 
in when this RS nor latch is on or when
the<00:05:00.730> button<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.000> pressed<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:02.110> circuit<00:05:02.590> turns

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
the button is pressed this circuit turns

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.200 
the button is pressed this circuit turns
and<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.300> course<00:05:07.330> right<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.290> is<00:05:08.410> the

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
and this of course right here is the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.110 
and this of course right here is the
default<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.490> mean<00:05:12.490> pressing<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.910> button

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
default so I mean pressing the button

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.850 
default so I mean pressing the button
really<00:05:13.270> doesn't<00:05:13.600> do<00:05:13.720> anything<00:05:14.080> yet<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.710> this

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
really doesn't do anything yet for this

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.550 
really doesn't do anything yet for this
one<00:05:15.040> but<00:05:15.310> for<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.610> other<00:05:15.730> two<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.870> does<00:05:17.110> as<00:05:17.410> you

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
one but for the other two it does as you

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.810 
one but for the other two it does as you
can<00:05:17.650> see<00:05:17.800> we<00:05:17.950> have<00:05:18.040> a<00:05:18.070> torch<00:05:18.280> here<00:05:18.460> that's<00:05:18.670> off

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
can see we have a torch here that's off

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.480 
can see we have a torch here that's off
and<00:05:19.090> our<00:05:19.180> torch<00:05:19.360> here<00:05:19.480> that's<00:05:19.690> off<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.050> torch

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
and our torch here that's off this torch

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.070 
and our torch here that's off this torch
switches<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:21.670> piece<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:22.750> torch

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
switches this piece and this torch

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.980 
switches this piece and this torch
switch<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:23.980> this<00:05:24.160> piece<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:25.150> through<00:05:25.720> here

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
switch is this piece so through here

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.160 
switch is this piece so through here
when<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.410> poke<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.710> button<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:28.330> circuit<00:05:29.020> is

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
when you poke the button this circuit is

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.300 
when you poke the button this circuit is
turned<00:05:29.620> off<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.710> completes<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.890> thing

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
turned off so that completes the thing

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.620 
turned off so that completes the thing
and<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.580> can<00:05:33.730> get<00:05:33.850> it<00:05:33.970> has<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.240> nice<00:05:34.390> little

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
and you can get it has a nice little

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.550 
and you can get it has a nice little
glass<00:05:34.930> roofs<00:05:35.230> you<00:05:35.530> can<00:05:35.650> take<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.860> peek<00:05:37.080> yeah<00:05:38.080> so

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
glass roofs you can take a peek yeah so

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.320 
glass roofs you can take a peek yeah so
let<00:05:38.770> me<00:05:38.860> show<00:05:39.040> you<00:05:39.070> here<00:05:39.400> I'll<00:05:39.580> poke<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.000> button

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
let me show you here I'll poke a button

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.840 
let me show you here I'll poke a button
real<00:05:40.510> quick<00:05:40.720> okay<00:05:41.680> chart<00:05:42.490> it<00:05:42.640> through<00:05:42.790> the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
real quick okay chart it through the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.470 
real quick okay chart it through the
door<00:05:43.000> here<00:05:43.260> so<00:05:44.260> if<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.410> poke<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.770> one<00:05:45.330> we<00:05:46.330> look

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
door here so if I poke that one we look

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.030 
door here so if I poke that one we look
through<00:05:46.600> here<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:48.130> end<00:05:49.410> circuit<00:05:50.410> is<00:05:50.590> now<00:05:50.770> off

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
through here that end circuit is now off

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.030 
through here that end circuit is now off
and<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:52.030> if<00:05:52.270> we<00:05:52.300> come<00:05:52.600> over<00:05:52.630> here<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.800> take<00:05:53.980> a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
and so if we come over here and take a

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.590 
and so if we come over here and take a
peek<00:05:54.220> through<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:57.250> is<00:05:57.430> switched<00:05:57.640> right

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
peek through here this is switched right

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.350 
peek through here this is switched right
there<00:05:58.780> like<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.080> so<00:05:59.260> you<00:05:59.350> just<00:05:59.500> come<00:05:59.680> in<00:05:59.860> and

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
there like that so you just come in and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.240 
there like that so you just come in and
zoom<00:06:01.360> right<00:06:01.540> off<00:06:01.720> as<00:06:02.380> soon<00:06:02.560> as<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.770> minecart

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
zoom right off as soon as a minecart

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.810 
zoom right off as soon as a minecart
passes<00:06:03.970> over<00:06:04.240> this<00:06:04.450> that<00:06:05.410> triggers<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.490> reset

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
passes over this that triggers the reset

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.190 
passes over this that triggers the reset
signal<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.420> we<00:06:07.840> go<00:06:07.960> back<00:06:08.170> that<00:06:08.380> way<00:06:08.410> again

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
signal and we go back that way again

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.280 
signal and we go back that way again
pretty<00:06:11.200> nice<00:06:11.410> now<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.160> course<00:06:12.840> this<00:06:13.840> is<00:06:14.080> tim

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
pretty nice now of course this is tim

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.010 
pretty nice now of course this is tim
isn't<00:06:14.470> foolproof<00:06:14.920> and<00:06:15.550> of<00:06:15.940> course<00:06:15.970> since<00:06:16.750> we

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
isn't foolproof and of course since we

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.070 
isn't foolproof and of course since we
play<00:06:17.320> on<00:06:17.560> our<00:06:17.590> own<00:06:17.980> SMP<00:06:18.610> server<00:06:18.820> or<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.960> know

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
if you play by yourself or you play with

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.570 
if you play by yourself or you play with
a<00:06:21.640> bunch<00:06:21.850> of<00:06:21.940> people<00:06:22.000> who<00:06:22.300> aren't<00:06:22.540> completely

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.850 

you<00:06:26.569> know<00:06:26.689> just<00:06:26.870> completely<00:06:27.349> willing<00:06:27.620> to

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
you know just completely willing to

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.320 
you know just completely willing to
wreck<00:06:28.069> your<00:06:28.250> entire<00:06:28.550> setup<00:06:28.849> this<00:06:29.090> will<00:06:29.240> work

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
wreck your entire setup this will work

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.540 
wreck your entire setup this will work
just<00:06:29.539> fine<00:06:29.629> you<00:06:30.110> can<00:06:30.349> activate<00:06:30.830> more<00:06:31.220> than<00:06:31.370> one

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
just fine you can activate more than one

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.460 
just fine you can activate more than one
button<00:06:31.879> of<00:06:32.300> course<00:06:32.569> if<00:06:32.689> you<00:06:32.780> activated<00:06:33.229> these

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
button of course if you activated these

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.290 
button of course if you activated these
two<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:34.129> would<00:06:34.219> only<00:06:34.400> end<00:06:34.669> up<00:06:34.849> with<00:06:35.030> this

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
two you would only end up with this

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.640 
two you would only end up with this
destination<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.229> destination

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
destination and that destination

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.909 
destination and that destination
wouldn't<00:06:36.919> get<00:06:37.129> reset<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:38.479> I<00:06:38.930> mean<00:06:39.530> obviously

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
wouldn't get reset so I mean obviously

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.409 
wouldn't get reset so I mean obviously
like<00:06:40.069> I<00:06:40.159> said<00:06:40.310> it's<00:06:40.430> not<00:06:40.580> foolproof<00:06:40.789> it's<00:06:41.270> not

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
like I said it's not foolproof it's not

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.969 
like I said it's not foolproof it's not
one<00:06:41.539> of<00:06:41.569> those<00:06:41.750> really<00:06:41.900> fancy<00:06:42.020> ones<00:06:42.560> that<00:06:42.830> you

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
one of those really fancy ones that you

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.080 
one of those really fancy ones that you
can't<00:06:43.250> um<00:06:44.949> you<00:06:45.949> know<00:06:46.069> you<00:06:46.129> can't<00:06:46.490> press<00:06:46.849> more

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090
