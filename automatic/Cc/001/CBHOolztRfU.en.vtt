00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 hello guys all by yourself as always sleigh and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.279
 today we will put our new potion 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 more precisely poison potion but also exchange 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 you throw up the cup to 1000 myself 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 welter now I will say how many things 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.029
 family or poisoning but along the way we 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.040
 we will throw units around kong donkey and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.870
 destroy them with this our new business so 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 the guys really found it some kind of comcast 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.450
 he did i have about five so at all 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.160
 they were empty so well here we are 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 Barbara bows and some magicians 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 let's get you all the whole so 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.719
 everything seems to have completely gone out and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.489
 let's collect it somewhere in one 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.379
 a bunch let's say here and these while he runs 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.149
 It can now be the day something will have to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 lead because it also slows down 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.470
 one as they went all in different ways 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.080
 so let's put them in one pile 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:13.549
 we will kill them all and him somewhere 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.549
 so well, and here they are we all die 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.100
 in principle for the first lvl'a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.480
 pretty good at killing everything here 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 the whole icon has become a breath 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.230
 I do not know now , probably, I probably 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.480
 I will always take a couple of these with me 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.310
 potions as she really is 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.580
 awesome 1 or was already killing 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 not bad all these new spells i will 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.890
 sway 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 most likely after pumping 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.060
 ordinary units and ordinary potions that is 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.370
 the very end so but let's also find 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 any opponent well here's another 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.330
 what is one clan caste in which there is 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.670
 some units here we have a bunch of archers 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's get them all they also he 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 like magic 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.810
 4 Levla on let's go again and collect all 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.259
 in one pack and kill how here 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 look there is a gift to a little bit free 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.600
 so we let's throw on again on 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.550
 advancing our potions from so well here's one 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.240
 the magician stayed with us 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.130
 let's throw in here they all sigh 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.670
 so not bad for the first lvl it 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.290
 a wonderful lion is possible on anyone 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'll take it by myself 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 We still have one here to whom we become magicians 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 like the last left and some 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.470
 pumped archers we let's see 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.220
 how to handle these units 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.790
 new potion 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 collected again in one pile I want already 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.020
 dogs 2 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.260
 so did not find anything there that's where our 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.970
 potion archers just instantly go out 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 well, we magicians livelier so to speak, and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.150
 need a little longer to be here but 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 in principle , funny 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.320
 be sure to try it yourself 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 this is really funny clan 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.160
 Castl just sdyhaet for a few 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 seconds but we haven't come across yet 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.660
 air so there is a dragon or such 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.650
 balls let's see how he can handle them 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.660
 we and here we have another one 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.420
 the completed icon has also become here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.600
 activated skeletons let's here 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.709
 all lure and collect in one pile 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.100
 look just like we have skeletons 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.150
 I'll glue some such creatures 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.710
 who are there literally 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 but for half a second immediately die 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.420
 they didn’t have time for movies and shadows 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.420
 already dead 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.180
 so oh well here are barbaras we have them too 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.610
 more powerful than archer 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.410
 die and a little longer basically he to 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.630
 he sent one deed quite enough all 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.930
 we will die if of course there is not 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.020
 dragons then this potion will just save you 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.760

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.230

 a bunch unfortunately I have left myself 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.010
 only two green had to take 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.920
 a little bit more it is possible we would them 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.280
 all killed so call go here in 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.850
 corner 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.070
 it seems to me here 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.490
 rider on a boar that we definitely Die 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.710
 dragon know no no since he almost 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.710
 maximum pumping mastered so 1 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.560
 so well the rider on the boar in our home 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.350
 the dragon stayed about 70 percent of it 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.420
 health but for two purposes of the first lvl 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.510
 This principle is not bad. What can I do 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.650
