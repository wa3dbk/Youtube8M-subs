00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.420 

I'm<00:00:50.969> laying<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> floured<00:00:52.530> surface

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.599 

what<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.940> doing<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:58.460> lining<00:00:59.460> up

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
what I'm going to be doing is lining up

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
what I'm going to be doing is lining up
a<00:00:59.940> spoonful<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.410> filling<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.010> then

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
a spoonful of the filling and then

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.469 
a spoonful of the filling and then
folding<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> over<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:05.000> I've<00:01:06.000> already<00:01:06.180> made

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
folding this over so I've already made

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.469 
folding this over so I've already made
the<00:01:06.840> filling<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.560> mixture<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.479> chicken

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the filling it's a mixture of chicken

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:21.100 
the filling it's a mixture of chicken
spinach<00:01:10.470> ricotta<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.030> mozzarella<00:01:12.270> cheese

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.890 

and<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> maybe<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.909> teaspoon<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and this is maybe about a teaspoon a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:37.690 
and this is maybe about a teaspoon a
heaping<00:01:25.650> teaspoon<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.479> filling<00:01:27.500> per<00:01:28.500> ravioli

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.070 

okay

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
okay

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.290 
okay
then<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.860> pizza<00:01:41.310> cutter<00:01:41.580> for<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> next

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
then I use a pizza cutter for the next

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.570 
then I use a pizza cutter for the next
part<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.750> works<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.320> well<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
part it works really well so you just

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.630 
part it works really well so you just
cut<00:01:47.580> across<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> fold<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.860> over

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
cut across and then you fold this over

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.900 
cut across and then you fold this over
you<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.140> try<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> press<00:01:53.399> down<00:01:53.580> from<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
you want to try and press down from the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.580 
you want to try and press down from the
middle<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> push<00:01:55.050> out<00:01:55.200> any<00:01:55.350> air

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
middle you want to push out any air

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.570 
middle you want to push out any air
bubbles<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.600> then<00:01:58.729> once<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.940> done<00:02:01.580> you

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
bubbles and then once that's done you

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:13.030 
bubbles and then once that's done you
take<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.300> fork<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.580> just<00:02:05.659> seal<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.050> edges

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910 

and<00:02:14.840> once<00:02:15.840> these<00:02:16.019> are<00:02:16.200> made<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.620> either

and once these are made you can either
cook<00:02:17.220> them<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.550> away<00:02:17.670> or<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.269> throw
