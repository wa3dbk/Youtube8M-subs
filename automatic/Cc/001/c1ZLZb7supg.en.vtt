redstone<00:00:11.459> clock<00:00:12.260> tutorial<00:00:13.260> which<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.709> also

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
redstone clock tutorial which is also

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.820 
redstone clock tutorial which is also
tolerable<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.860> can<00:00:16.860> never<00:00:17.430> ever<00:00:18.410> get<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.560> word

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
tolerable I can never ever get that word

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.029 
tolerable I can never ever get that word
out<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.340> mouth<00:00:20.450> but<00:00:21.450> let's<00:00:22.079> begin<00:00:22.470> by

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
out of my mouth but let's begin by

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.810 
out of my mouth but let's begin by
placing<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.210> block<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.820> placing

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
placing a block like this and placing

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
placing a block like this and placing
some<00:00:27.000> redstone<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.570> top<00:00:28.039> then<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.369> place

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
some redstone on top then you place

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.650 
some redstone on top then you place
another<00:00:29.759> block<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.970> then<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.269> can<00:00:33.449> make

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
another block like so then you can make

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920 
another block like so then you can make
this<00:00:33.900> longer<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.370> want<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> depends

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this longer if you want what it depends

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.439 
this longer if you want what it depends
on<00:00:37.140> how<00:00:37.379> many<00:00:37.440> repeaters<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:39.269> let's

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
on how many repeaters you want so let's

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.439 
on how many repeaters you want so let's
just<00:00:39.659> use<00:00:39.870> 30<00:00:40.530> beers<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.879> want<00:00:42.089> to<00:00:42.180> really

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
just use 30 beers if you want to really

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.259 
just use 30 beers if you want to really
compact<00:00:42.900> you<00:00:43.080> can<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> let's<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
compact you can use this so let's just

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.039 
compact you can use this so let's just
do<00:00:45.479> that<00:00:45.920> put<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.949> torch<00:00:47.220> right<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:48.049> make

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
do that put a torch right there make

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.090 
do that put a torch right there make
sure<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.909> second<00:00:51.390> tick<00:00:51.629> or

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
sure this one is on the second tick or

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
sure this one is on the second tick or
it<00:00:53.100> needs<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.119> least<00:00:54.150> say<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:55.170> tix<00:00:55.530> otherwise

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it needs at least say two tix otherwise

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.829 
it needs at least say two tix otherwise
this<00:00:56.790> thing<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.239> burn<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.979> so<00:00:58.979> if<00:00:59.689> you<00:01:00.689> want

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
this thing will burn out so if you want

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.229 
this thing will burn out so if you want
to<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:01.049> it<00:01:01.170> tolerable<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.949> put<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.549> lever

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to make it tolerable you put a lever

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.460 
to make it tolerable you put a lever
there<00:01:03.589> now<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.489> negative<00:01:06.030> side<00:01:06.540> which

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
there now you have a negative side which

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.450 
there now you have a negative side which
is<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.890> inverted<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> positive<00:01:09.900> side

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
is an inverted side and a positive side

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.719 
is an inverted side and a positive side
so<00:01:11.460> i<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.880> i<00:01:12.149> would<00:01:12.960> recommend<00:01:13.799> generally

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so i would i would recommend generally

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.649 
so i would i would recommend generally
just<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.549> positive<00:01:17.549> side<00:01:17.820> instead

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
just to use this positive side instead

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.060 
just to use this positive side instead
of<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.929> one<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.829> can<00:01:20.039> be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of this one because this one can be

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.389 
of this one because this one can be
controlled<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.939> lever<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:23.159> one

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
controlled with the lever that one

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.239 
controlled with the lever that one
cannot<00:01:23.789> also<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.749> can<00:01:24.929> put<00:01:25.109> a<00:01:25.140> lever<00:01:25.439> anywhere

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
cannot also you can put a lever anywhere

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:29.810 
cannot also you can put a lever anywhere
on<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:27.719> block<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.289> torch<00:01:28.799> off<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.579> torch

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
on the block on the torch off the torch

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.639 
on the block on the torch off the torch
you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.899> block<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
you can put it on the block of the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.149 
you can put it on the block of the
redstone<00:01:32.429> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> anywhere

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
redstone you can you can put it anywhere

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.359 
redstone you can you can put it anywhere
really<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.249> can<00:01:35.399> even<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.289> but<00:01:37.369> then

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
really you can even put it here but then

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
really you can even put it here but then
again<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.700> shouldn't<00:01:39.149> do<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:41.569> now<00:01:42.569> for

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
again you shouldn't do that now for

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.249 
again you shouldn't do that now for
making<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.890> thing<00:01:43.950> longer<00:01:44.780> let's<00:01:45.780> put<00:01:46.049> some

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
making this thing longer let's put some

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
making this thing longer let's put some
more<00:01:46.439> repeaters<00:01:46.950> own<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.270> make<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
more repeaters own you can make this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.349 
more repeaters own you can make this
actually<00:01:49.429> really<00:01:50.429> long<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.090> i'm<00:01:51.179> not<00:01:51.299> going

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
actually really long but i'm not going

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.760 
actually really long but i'm not going
to<00:01:51.630> show<00:01:51.749> you<00:01:51.929> in<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:52.439> tutorial<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:54.240> should

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
to show you in this tutorial this should

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.639 
to show you in this tutorial this should
basically<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.460> explain<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.569> like<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
basically just explain it all like this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.489 
basically just explain it all like this
put<00:01:59.639> a<00:01:59.670> torch<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.240> again<00:02:00.569> redstone

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
put a torch like this again redstone

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.149 
put a torch like this again redstone
underneath<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:02.039> torch<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.719> look<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.869> that

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
underneath the torch and look at that

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.499 
underneath the torch and look at that
put<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.549> back<00:02:05.819> on<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.090> first<00:02:06.329> one

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
put this one on back on the first one

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.440 
put this one on back on the first one
now<00:02:07.139> you<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> four<00:02:07.709> tix<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.270> put

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
now you have four tix then you can put

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380 
now you have four tix then you can put
your<00:02:09.660> output<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.740> now<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.880> course<00:02:11.910> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
your output like this now of course this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.410 
your output like this now of course this
one<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:13.709> less

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
one is way less

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420 
one is way less
compact<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.750> course<00:02:17.080> well<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.220> nice<00:02:18.400> thing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
compact of course well the nice thing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.699 
compact of course well the nice thing
about<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.090> thing<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:19.900> only<00:02:20.470> one

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
about this thing is that it's only one

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.190 
about this thing is that it's only one
block<00:02:21.010> wide<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:22.030> put<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.390> lot<00:02:22.959> of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
block wide so you can put a lot of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.890 
block wide so you can put a lot of
clocks<00:02:23.830> next<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> each<00:02:24.790> other<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:25.569> you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
clocks next to the each other if if you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.510 
clocks next to the each other if if you
if<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:27.099> want<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.220> use
