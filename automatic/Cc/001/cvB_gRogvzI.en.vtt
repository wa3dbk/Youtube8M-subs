00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.019
 I am very proud of their team because 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 music a tough journey because it is also true 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.089
 she who had the lag I am immediately 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 saw nothing much after the margin collector 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.410
 energy became losses in the analysis 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 from the marching cousin that does n't mean 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 that we do not learn the lesson but the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 put all energy into the macho vandal 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 fears there apart from the fact that we 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 play things today because this is one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 strong brothers that is a team that and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.600
 all players are talking about that moment 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 are in week because they are 2727 and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.610
 that brings you into one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.590
 yes an incredible motivational flow and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 we've seen them shine there today 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.239
 all trust and strength 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 explosivity fine you name it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.390
 had to be in the steps that becomes the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 intention today of course this afternoon 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 was put together with the spiders on their 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.010
 the heart must have today and must 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 had today about accelerating 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 our limit go in the first half 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.540
 we could not break open the game 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.400
 it was a scholar and coaching 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 the match was about to find it through you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 mistakes to weigh here we hit no to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.229
 especially to do with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.210
 yes with the strength in the viewer of the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 beep that is also pretty stupid 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.799
 what the second half is peace I 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 some say that sven kums had to be low 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 Players and art had to go lower 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.409
 play around like that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 goods and merchandise to relieve 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.509
 the apple and where you the wia and and one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 pokoe came in to be you two 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.300
 To help we pointed out the we had 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 the plus and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.670
 one and the fauvillers and thereby could 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.800
 We are more current Hans P and we could go for it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.330
 more threat and I also think if 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.400
 you watched the match as a whole 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.480
 that we actually have more grapes to 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.210
 give examples 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.460
 yes to go for a third profit 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.660
 the competitions it is not 23 on 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.690
 30 that's fantastic 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.200
 take a breath now 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.540
 so the correct word i'm going after tomorrow 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.400
 all that one play and 21 march of the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.050
 second team that boys go a long way 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.640
 been in cats eight minutes before time 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.110
 I said I'm not going to replace it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 for him 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.020
 whoever does not come to which 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.000
 The intention is that he now also nobody 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.800
 know this is a match that so on it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 the cut is that you actually 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.640
 need a few minutes to get to Maria 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.040
 to get into that match i had him 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 seen with us turk and carts and casilla 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 they were not immediately in the margin 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.740
 and that is not easy 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.240
 and everyone was good with us 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.090
 and I wanted to see who she could take 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.950
 moreover, it turned out to be good yes you come 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.720
 this week we can where from that place 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 he nevertheless is also international 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.610
 not gone and would date the balloon 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.600
 me too yes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.950

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.960
 instead of I speak of course 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.490
 like to coach like that 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.910

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.330
