00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.190
 the recipe I make a drink today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.320
 easy and delicious hot and besides being 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 a little different a chocolate 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.820
 hot white chocolate with each name 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.080
 That's what you want with a little bit of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.140
 diseases 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.600
 trade with a cup of milk 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.600
 integral to a clique 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.130
 also adding a quarter cup 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:43.850
 cream or fresh cream that is 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:47.300
 he gets super caring two or three 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 cardamom fronts that give a flavor 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 superficial but take the hand of dynamic 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.580
 so that it opens and the seedlings 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580
 fell out 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.309
 macbook air tea extract extract 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 family 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.689
 The people, since their milk gives a light 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 chopped white chocolate, which is what I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.509
 I'm using 60 grams more or less 10 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.189
 little squares 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:18.229
 now I 'll let your milk over low heat 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.229
 just until he starts living 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 now comes the point that is optional 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 if you are adults and you are very cold 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:38.159
 I recommend putting two tablespoons of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.960
 whiskey or know now I add the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.210
 chopped white chocolate 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.509
 I still do not move this time 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:54.569
 Melt the two had before minutinhos 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:57.140
 a little bit more for those who smoke and step 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.140
 by a sieve 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.350
 I speak a little bit of bitter chocolate 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.350
 above only to decorate 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.080
 What delicious hot chocolate without 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.490
 doubt that if anyone 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.490
 A kiss and until next time
