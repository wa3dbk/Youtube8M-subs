00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.260
 I must say that I was very satisfied with the mb white interiors of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.680
 drafting certainty 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.350

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.600
 bought two that are moderate are the darker colors are of a color that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 they were interested then in enamels and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.119
 I must say that first of all I liked all the relatives going crazy and 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.110
 they are really three beautiful colors 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.790
 issimi was inspired by this collection 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.980
 you have the colors of minerals so stones and minerals contain. hotel 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.100

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.050
 absolutely amazing the enamels on all five new ones 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 graphita 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 for this 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.810
 this is why we say that it was considered a poem steve e della 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.490
 vi from the collection 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.339
 ehehehe as you see 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.829
 a 601 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.430
 commands the myriad of glitter in its interior that give it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.159
 bull shades 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.620
 and in fact this enamel laugh depending on how it is struck by the light 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.169
 candle will propose shades of blue and white a pass - a shade 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.109
 more duration so it is really a very very particular glaze 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.369

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.060
 pro and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.100

 however look at how wonderful 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.899

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.560
 I tell you immediately that all three enamels I love a very very nice writing 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.980
 the system easily no way completely d fluid texture 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.939
 and this example is a single pass 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.390
 so it is 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.809
 sister sledge hockey with one-pass information agrarian reform 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.909
 it is the fifth there was not really a texture very well 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.239
 all three of these enamels have therefore absolutely not disappointed by this 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.379
 point of view 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.039

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.909

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.460
 I would like to say a color 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 anyway 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.479
 so 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.770
 this, too, in my opinion is still very beautiful 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.750
 I've only been through this once 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 and it already extends very close but they have passed sufficiently covering 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.659
 I think they are enamels that do not need to be stretched twice 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.340
 used the first assisting very well 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.429
