00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:03.270
 lol kav 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.910
 rob kuiper came to woudenberg four years ago to become a horse farm 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.789
 to start 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.929
 if he buys the farm on the parallel road and only one from the neighbors 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.129
 little chicken run 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.220
 Then of course you go for that to make such an investment 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.869
 so city hall to ask the alderman that you have done with one 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.439
 purchase broker 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.230
 and yes they just said the state can't do anything on the role context but that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.580
 turns out not to be because soon required alongside his business and the huge 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.610
 chicken shed 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.400
 and it is over with the rest the club rents the second time that goes constant 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.720
 one after the other 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.039
 And that's yes you have to realize that they count 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.250
 30,000 chickens in 10 percent of that has gone 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 it is therefore only up to 3,000 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.740
 well that goes 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.420
 that is constantly crowing one after the other through the basket 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.100
 in the summer months 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.550
 it actually starts at 3 o'clock at night 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.030
 today it is quiet because according to rob there is time with the new batch 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.649
 brought 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.170
 they cannot run yet 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 the neighbor does not want to respond but according to rob there are more 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.860
 have been conversations with him that have led to nothing he has just been 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 He was thinking he was experiencing what 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.310
 the municipality can be found 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.490
 on the one hand I can agree with him there this spring 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.820
 He also thinks that municipalities will catch your eye and then it will become clear which form 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 is of course right 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.950
 on the other hand 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.210
 I think if you personally go to your neighbors it is very neat 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 was measures 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.730
 but he does not take those measures 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.670
 Rob now finds that the municipality of Woudenberg should intervene who had the permit 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.350
 never give what the shed is way too close to the house where openly 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.499
 Violence rumors that there are 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.940
 but on the internet 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.820
 I hear that around here 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.880
 that that that that made the lines walcott 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.290
 granting permits 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.280
 no 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.160
 authorities municipal authorities issuing the permit 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 have to check you know things like that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.589
 the favoritism or not 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.229
 the barn states and the municipality must also come up with a solution 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.289
 isolate 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.299
 yes and must have another animal species 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.010
 the real thing 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.239
 only five months 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.839
 bert cracked 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.649
 The solution is simple but it seems the hammers are still open for the time being 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:24.359
 has not ended
