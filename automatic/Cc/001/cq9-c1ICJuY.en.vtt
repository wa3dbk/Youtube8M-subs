00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.680
 the tube that passes with a mobile in this 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.010
 boeing video pointed is a statement 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 ok it 's a little different from what you see 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.330
 teach but good 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.189
 this is one as you see good a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.000
 television depends on the size you can 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.310
 make a television or you can make a 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.640
 movie screen that we leave it 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.910
 tradition then what is the bad thing about 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.800
 of this exact screen size that is 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.350
 two blocks in two black blocks of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.640
 wool 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.649
 2 for 3 that there is no picture worth 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.930
 some other paintings there are no pictures of two 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.289
 by three or by one going out I get 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 none 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.339
 a year a picture of 2 x 3 you see a lot that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.550
 put it where they put it there are pictures of 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.770
 2 x 3 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.510
 so if you want it you believed it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510
 on television you will have to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.550
 you will have to make it bigger or more 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.800
 small as you see 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.150
 As you can see, it's not difficult at all 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.310
 do 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.430
 I think I have the brightness lowered can 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 be 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.810
 I also just recorded another chapter 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 now but what will you need then sucked 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 you will need trap doors 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.570
 and black wool we are going to take the black 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.760
 as well 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.760
 the black gray wool 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.170
 where are the oscar 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.550
 you looking for something nice right now close 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.380
 tom and quiet bookstores you put good 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.230
 this obviously bigger size more 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.330
 small as you like, you put 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.520
 three like this 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.520
 you put two of tommasi blogs 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 here and here after you put obviously not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.970
 I'm saying that the size you can 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.610
 vary you can do what you want 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.610
 I'm going to show you a graphic example 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.210
 wrong 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.670
 ok this has these treaties have 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.090
 two functions you can do as 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:46.269
 that are speakers or shelves 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.819
 as you see this we are traction and I 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.420
 I personally find it more ugly 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.959
 but you can do this that they are 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.959
 normal speakers 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 and put this as shelves 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 it could also look good but it seems 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.750
 which is so that they do not just give 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.350
 television but good 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.190
 and here the graphic example of today mouse and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.720
 to live as you see is a map of 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.760
 tests when you get to do the point 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.960
 7.3 began to pour water everywhere 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 good and I do not know if it is that it is not very 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.040
 very far because later we lose the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.020
 home 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.970
 good 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.170
 let's go in a straight line massage in 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.660
 straight line we lose 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.300
 good 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.450
 over there 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.450
 it's all full of beige lava isolated 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.360
 it is because over there it says like a generator 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.610
 Automatic covers ton and good 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.280
 pretty good and as you can see this is the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.990
 example imagine you are worth this is a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.120
 separate room 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.940
 and here you have your television is 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.650
 exactly the same as the tutorial here 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.170
 television here the sofa 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.879
 and they put or a sofa finishing the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.879
 poster or entering 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.200
 that is your decision what you 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.810
 look prettier or beige and stick out 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.560
 a little bit here also good obviously is 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.989
 that you can make them from 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.660
 of the material that you are interested in but these 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.510
 are normal stairs and this is that 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.790
 Well, how would this be like a sofa 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.580
 normal I do not know what it's called 3 if I believe 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.520
 of three armchairs a normal sofa and this 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.620
 I do not know if it's like that worldwide but here 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.110
 in Spain it's called chaise longe 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.820
 to stretch good taste the video of 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.710
 aid for it or subscribe do not forget 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.260
 to turn on the television 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.440
 hahaha hash taco good guys up 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.440
