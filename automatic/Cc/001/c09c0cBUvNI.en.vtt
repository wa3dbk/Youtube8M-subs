00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
right now most people who do this fight

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.829

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
so basically he has a lot of area of

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.329 
so basically he has a lot of area of
effect<00:00:55.689> attacks<00:00:56.689> one<00:00:57.259> where<00:00:57.530> he<00:00:57.710> swipes<00:00:58.129> to

this<00:01:41.179> fight<00:01:41.420> was<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.689> little<00:01:42.020> bit<00:01:42.109> different

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
this fight was a little bit different

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.620 
this fight was a little bit different
than<00:01:42.799> most<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.579> my<00:01:43.609> stray<00:01:44.030> demon<00:01:44.210> fights

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
than most of my stray demon fights

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.669 
than most of my stray demon fights
mostly<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:45.710> he<00:01:46.659> kept<00:01:47.659> pile<00:01:47.990> driving<00:01:48.350> into

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
mostly because he kept pile driving into

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.739 
mostly because he kept pile driving into
the<00:01:48.770> ground<00:01:49.039> like<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.450> does<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
the ground like that and that does the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.840 
the ground like that and that does the
explosion<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.859> it<00:01:52.009> really<00:01:52.219> leaves<00:01:52.520> him<00:01:52.729> open

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
explosion and it really leaves him open

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.120 
explosion and it really leaves him open
so<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.719> can<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.380> know<00:01:54.469> shove<00:01:54.799> whatever

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130
