00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 that's it everyone greets faskil so 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.620
 we find ourselves today for the whole 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 first episode of my new series 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 of bone for those who follow me on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.750
 fifa 13 I had made a series that was 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.310
 sets off for the green all and that's 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 a series that I had enough rather more 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.119
 to my subscribers so why not in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.640
 redo a so in the last video 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.500
 I asked you on which team 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 I was just going to start this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 series so there we end up for the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.779
 first episode and so like you 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.160
 saw it in the title it's on the way 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.660
 for the dortmund so dortmund very very 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.450
 good team so there is really very 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.680
 good players so so that's fine 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
 really be a pretty series 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 friendly so there I will rather you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 explain for those who know me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 not pretty much this series so it's a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 short enough episode that it will last I 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 believe about five minutes the others 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.180
 will last approximately between 5 and 10 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 maximum minutes after it's done a little 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.420
 too long so I opened an impact 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 bronze so 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.110
 so here is so I had only three kinds 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.420
 gold 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.160
 forgiveness brilliant bronze so it's rather 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.290
 not bad I may be léman so there 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.680
 I made a mistake I sold fast 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.600
 all the other players is true that I 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.370
 will be pretty much short of two players 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.630
 days brandon it's a little air of 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.729
 rap so it's not very serious either 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.010
 so here to start low as we did not 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.450
 no money, we're going to throw a little money 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.630
 match in this series for those who 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.950
 do not know this is the purpose of the series 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.420
 is alone in the world to see the team 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.520
 from dortmund so I think that's it 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.910
 so understood it in this series 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.259
 I absolutely have the right to take 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.750
 only the players of dortmund so 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.240
 I do not need to buy a bronze day 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.970
 from another club so that's the purpose of 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.700
 this series so for to get to this 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 but then I'm gonna have to do it of course 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.899
 of the doggedness so I have not yet 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.250
 done on this fifa 14 years old that I do not know 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.369
 too much how to do it for now 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.390
 so is safe at a resale buying party 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.740
 and a game part there we see that I 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.780
 I just scored my first goal of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.149
 this series so a super super goal 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 ugly and so that's the purpose of the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.530
 victory so only for this first match 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.680
 I won a single goal to zero so that's 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.140
 rather not bad so 590 a credit so 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 I still dominated the first 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.010
 half time to continue if they wanted 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.530
 know so there and I already changed the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.220
 training of my team so alas of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.170
 back to the menu we already have 1962 credit 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.700
 so here I did before a pretty to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.680
 to do on this kind so it sold 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.510
 600 credits for a player in a pack 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.489
 it's pretty good so thanks fifa 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.709
 for now it's starting pretty well 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.209
 beyond we start well only by a 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 little bit of buying resale at it 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.900
 be amended small benefits 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.290
 for now so I did on akin 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.239
 favre with calm in style shield 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 so I advise you to do on on 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.230
 styles so it is a technique that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.730
 walking that works pretty well and there I 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.830
 done on doumbia so a small affair 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 so I have not found any 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.099
 techniques so I think it'll come 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 I hope to find there a technique that 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.160
 works as well as the one in fifa 13 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.700
 so I was really doing a lot of 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.530
 profits so here's where I started 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 the second game of this series so 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.090
 it's really a short episode 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.379
 is going to be one of the only matches he's me 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.989
 I do not know if I've done too much 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.209
 2 or 3 finally we are three games 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.310
 premises will be attacked the second 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.620
 match so of course I will soon 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.810
 change the legault and jerseys so 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.849
 to do will the series a little more 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.049
 pretty we'll say but for now 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.830
 I do not have a lot of credit people 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.239
 we will keep these emblems that are my 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.250
 pretty pretty faith so here I fall against 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.630
 a bronze team so I advise you 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.040
 at the very beginning is to go to a match 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.319
 simple like that you see the collective 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.610
 and the water level doc the opening of the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.290
 willam judgment score is a good 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.079
 player a good little brazilian in 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.610
 scorer who is rushed basic finally I 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.920
 their goal and it's really a very 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.900
 good player so the new time 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.090
 williams who hits cross it falls down 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.950
 on we are we also like them 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.250
 have all been Brazilian at the 15th 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.410
 minute 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.970
 so I start pretty well this game I 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.299
 would like that it will quickly calm down so 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.650
 a little domination my part and that's it 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.569
 So that nothing happened during 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.410
 half time during the 2nd half pardon 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.459
 and so well I'll go second match two 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.840
 matches won so far so that's 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.989
 rather not bad these series start 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.030
 really really really good with 665 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.039
 year so it's rather a big enough 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.780
 are ok we're gonna I really 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.300
 largely dominated my opponent with 10 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.620
 shots and 58 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.199
 possession of ball so it's rather 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.970
 not bad so there's back to the menu we have 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.800
 three thousand credit so we two small 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.750
 players sold themselves akinfeev and 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.250
 doumbia so that makes us 3000 credit 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.270
 for now and so I'm going to buy 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.870
 my first 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.140
 to first players so it's a middle 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.480
 left 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.850
 so frankly I will not be able to 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.930
 tell you the name because it's a name 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.600
 German and let's say I'm not 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.180
 very good in German and so so that's it 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.280
 he has my faith no stat super ugly no 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.100
 plus he has stats from a worthy player 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.630
 a player out will not have so we'll see what 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.580
 that will give 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.590
 so we did not do too much 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.680
 increase the collective but hey we 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.350
 does anyway a kind of gold 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.550
 his soil so opus simply so brew 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.820
 on the high seas players it's still 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.509
 me there are so onlookers so here we have it 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.979
 we will launch this last match so that 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.120
 this episode is going to be really short 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.770
 so it's been a long time since I 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.820
 not comment on a series so that makes 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.150
 pretty weird and it really does 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.130
 pleasure 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.770
 and so there we fall against a team 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.030
 only rare bronze players opus 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.880
 so we'll see what it's going to look like 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.100
 so it was not until the 120th minute 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.830
 I did not see all the paintings of 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.360
 scores and so here I do a double 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.620
 square and then it makes us a head 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.419
 plunging of my amossé mossoro so a 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.220
 very nice goal in the 120th minute is 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.070
 really the goal that saves the match 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.570
 so here are the guys if you liked it I 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.500
 really invites you to let a little 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.750
 I like it would make me really happy 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.370
 see if he's going if you always follow 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.830
 this series even if it's over time 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.970
 that I have not done any video on su on this 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.970
 be well to the next
