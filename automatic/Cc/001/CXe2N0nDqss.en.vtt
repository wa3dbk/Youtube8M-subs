 the area in meters is calculated 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.410
 square of the roof surface in

 simply summing up the tunes of 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 various sections of the roof the sum of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.380
 the total air is then divided by the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.840
