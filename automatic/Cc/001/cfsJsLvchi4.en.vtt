00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.980
 Hello everyone 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.540
 This is the dark was it today 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.880
 found for a new video of 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.310
 klitschko rejected at 59 to be able to play 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.710
 to first-person view as 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.119
 same name on a square duty so why 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.410
 that its sublime that you will start 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.150
 to find you in the same place as 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.650
 me in the video so that's where 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.810
 find just about all the rides and in 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.670
 especially the Ferris wheel you 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.559
 are you approaching the portal for 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.539
 climb in but normally and hand 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.610
 helping you be able to make arrow of 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.530
 right for the Ferris wheel to stop 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.270
 and you will have to do that so you will have 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.739
 everything to do right arrow and as soon as 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.510
 the road stops 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.370
 Normally you will have a cabin that will 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.530
 stop right in front of you and swim 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.480
 as soon as this little cabin stops 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.399
 right in front of you you will have to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.899
 suicide is why, before he 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.629
 will still have to prepare to do 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.190
 cdec and prepare to arouse and so 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.079
 as I wanted to say as soon as the cabin 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.149
 stop in front of you very quickly 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.770
 you will have to commit suicide and not a 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.989
 once you've reappeared eh ben on 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.509
 this time you will have to find yourself 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.319
 to the roller coaster and so you have to 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.090
 mounted in 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.529
 I saw a little wait until the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.719
 Russian mountain ends to be able to 

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:15.459
 eventually get into it and not a 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.630
 Once you have entered the 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.979
 russian mountain you will be able 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.590
 to see that as soon as your character 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.450
 is sitting on the mountain seats 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.579
 Russian normally and has for about 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.679
 a second he will teleport himself 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.639
 time in a mountain cabin 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.349
 Russian while standing 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.299
 so if it's done well in the 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.310
 cleach will be realized and so 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.130
 a face to the done as you will be in the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.869
 ferris wheel and you will have the view of the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.359
 roller coaster so basically you'll 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.349
 merge the two attractions and so 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.999
 once you are in the big 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.529
 wheel and ben you have to change 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.149
 camera to take the one to the first 

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:49.119
 nobody and you'll just have to wait 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.279
 as the roller coaster finishes its way 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.810
 and normally eybens a created form 

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.369
 a Russian will have finished as from 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.169
 magic and ben it goes directly to you 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.700
 teleport to russian russian loan 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:58.209
 again and this time it do you 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.529
 go down 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.299
 now that once you're in 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:03.340
 out of your roller coaster and ben 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.119
 there you will be able to play at the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.469
 first person 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.329
 so for those who did not know 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.250
 this view is really a bath like 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.600
 of the real it's not like he 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.790
 to camera is distant another 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 character it's like the camera and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.450
 in his head and so after you go 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.070
 to have fun getting in 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.390
 vehicles and drive with I find that 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.560
 it's really super nice of the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.390
 realize because is rejected normally 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.010
 it's not available and you're even going 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.780
 to be able to see the cockpits 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.220
 vehicles and or what that thing is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.810
 really nice you will be able to me the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.280
 do with motorcycles with any 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.900
 vehicle and I still find a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.450
 beech fun enough that you will be able 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.650
 carry out alone or with your friends if 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 you wish it the only drawback 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 is that sometimes the camera by a little 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.080
 no matter how but otherwise what it 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.730
 is really huge and I advise you 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.350
 greatly so that's it I hope this 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.760
