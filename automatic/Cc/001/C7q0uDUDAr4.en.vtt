00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
here I've cut out a roughly the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.260 
here I've cut out a roughly the
selection<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.809> tree<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> see

this horrible white sort of halo to the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.430 
this horrible white sort of halo to the
edges<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> tree<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> example<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> quickly

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
edges of the tree so example I quickly

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
edges of the tree so example I quickly
put<00:00:52.680> together<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> show<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.030> how

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
put together for you to show you how

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.979 
put together for you to show you how
this<00:00:54.809> effect<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.530> work<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> here<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this effect will work so here as you can

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
pretty gone I don't see it fits quite

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
pretty gone I don't see it fits quite
well<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.260> scene<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> don't<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.780> showing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

you how to do that so I'm gonna bring
into<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.409> tree<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
into in the the tree first of all so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
into in the the tree first of all so
let's<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.770> or<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.869> okay<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.960> shut

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
let's get in there or is it okay to shut

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.950 
let's get in there or is it okay to shut
this<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.380> first<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.720> reopen<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.580> okay

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
this down first just like reopen it okay

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
this down first just like reopen it okay
so<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> first<00:01:26.310> step

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so we got here and then the first step

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
so we got here and then the first step
to<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.700> small<00:01:27.479> boys<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.259> with

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to do is small boys you can do this with

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.289 
to do is small boys you can do this with
a<00:01:28.920> white<00:01:29.159> background<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> tree

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
a white background up with a tree

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
a white background up with a tree
channels<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> best<00:01:31.799> way<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> do

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
channels is probably the best way to do

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
channels is probably the best way to do
this<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.729> also<00:01:32.850> use<00:01:33.350> color<00:01:34.350> range

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this but you can also use color range

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.950 
this but you can also use color range
and<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> selection<00:01:36.750> there

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and then get the selection there

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.920 
and then get the selection there
fuzziness<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.770> down<00:01:38.509> if<00:01:39.509> you've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
fuzziness right down if you've got it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140 
fuzziness right down if you've got it
inverted<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.850> tree

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
inverted you can actually see the tree

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
inverted you can actually see the tree
instead<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> masks<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
instead of the masks and you can

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.609 
instead of the masks and you can
actually<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.100> trying<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.619> I'm

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
actually see what you're trying out I'm

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
actually see what you're trying out I'm
gonna<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:47.360> channels<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> go

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gonna use channels for this so if you go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310 
gonna use channels for this so if you go
to<00:01:49.200> channels<00:01:49.729> get<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> blue<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:52.140> then

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
to channels get the blue and then

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
to channels get the blue and then
duplicate<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.799> say<00:01:53.130> right<00:01:53.189> click<00:01:53.549> duplicate

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
duplicate it say right click duplicate

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
duplicate it say right click duplicate
as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.990> got<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.320> black<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
as you can see it's got a good black to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
as you can see it's got a good black to
white<00:01:56.250> ratio<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.210> gonna<00:01:57.329> kinda

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
white ratio on this it's gonna kinda

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
white ratio on this it's gonna kinda
tree<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.310> today

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
always make the mask doing this and then

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.400 
always make the mask doing this and then
mask<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.970> out<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.330> if<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.480> straight<00:02:55.049> up<00:02:55.080> mean<00:02:55.290> by

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
mask it out so if I straight up mean by

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.400 
mask it out so if I straight up mean by
that<00:02:56.450> well<00:02:57.450> we're<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.810> sure<00:02:57.870> I'll<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.290> do

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that well we're not sure I'll just do

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.220 
that well we're not sure I'll just do
the<00:02:58.849> main<00:02:59.849> thing<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.299> can<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the main thing you can do that if you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.039 
the main thing you can do that if you
want<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:02.489> got<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:02.970> here<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.599> as<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.959> can

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
want to so got it here and as you can

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.930 
want to so got it here and as you can
see<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> horrible<00:03:04.980> white<00:03:05.220> halo<00:03:05.519> around

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
see it's a horrible white halo around

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.339 
see it's a horrible white halo around
all<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.590> bush<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.950> tree<00:03:08.959> get<00:03:09.959> rid<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.200> that

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
all the bush the tree get rid of that

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.190 
all the bush the tree get rid of that
it's<00:03:10.620> very<00:03:10.830> simple<00:03:11.480> which<00:03:12.480> most<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.140> probably

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
it's very simple which most you probably

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.289 
it's very simple which most you probably
won't<00:03:13.560> know<00:03:13.829> what<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.269> a

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
won't know what this is so you get a

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.729 
won't know what this is so you get a
layer<00:03:16.190> matting<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.609> remove<00:03:17.970> white<00:03:18.209> matte<00:03:18.420> t

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
layer matting and a remove white matte t

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.099 
layer matting and a remove white matte t
as<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.799> can<00:03:19.950> see<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.250> got<00:03:20.640> rid<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.049> if<00:03:22.049> you

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
as you can see it got rid of it if you

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.920 
as you can see it got rid of it if you
do<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.290> once<00:03:22.709> more<00:03:22.829> again<00:03:23.660> don't<00:03:24.660> worry<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
do it once more again don't worry it a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.870 
do it once more again don't worry it a
lot<00:03:25.049> more<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.980> might<00:03:26.069> be<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> bit<00:03:26.430> too<00:03:26.579> much<00:03:26.700> too

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
lot more it might be a bit too much too

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.390 
lot more it might be a bit too much too
much<00:03:27.030> got<00:03:27.269> rid<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.569> too<00:03:27.660> much<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> tree

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
much got rid of or too much of the tree

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.860 
much got rid of or too much of the tree
but<00:03:29.400> let's<00:03:29.549> bring<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.850> into<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.299> scene<00:03:30.540> see

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
but let's bring it into the scene see

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.500 
but let's bring it into the scene see
what<00:03:31.109> we're<00:03:31.260> dealing<00:03:31.410> with<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.709> I'm<00:03:32.040> gonna

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
what we're dealing with so I'm gonna

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.020 
what we're dealing with so I'm gonna
take<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.900> out<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.440> I'll<00:03:34.829> keep<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:35.910> of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
take this one out so I'll keep all of

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.650 
take this one out so I'll keep all of
the<00:03:36.180> adjustments<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.989> little<00:03:37.340> bit<00:03:38.660> short

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the adjustments just a little bit short

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.759 
the adjustments just a little bit short
this<00:03:39.750> here<00:03:39.930> let's<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.590> bring<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.190> here

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
this here let's just bring this in here

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.960 
this here let's just bring this in here
okay<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:43.799> as<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.100> see<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.549> still<00:03:44.730> Gough

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
okay so as you can see it's still Gough

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.599 
okay so as you can see it's still Gough
like<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.450> sort<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.750> tin<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.350> tinge<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.489> got

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
like I sort of tin a tinge and it's got

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.449 
like I sort of tin a tinge and it's got
the<00:03:47.730> green<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.230> greatest<00:03:49.470> we

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
the green and it's not the greatest we

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.830 
the green and it's not the greatest we
do<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.850> by<00:03:50.940> using<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.299> fringe<00:03:51.569> as<00:03:51.750> though

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
do that by using the fringe as though

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.920 
do that by using the fringe as though
it's<00:03:52.079> also<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.410> same<00:03:52.650> passive<00:03:53.639> layer

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
it's also on the same passive layer

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.199 
it's also on the same passive layer
matting<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.019> defringe<00:03:55.489> so<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.880> amount<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
matting and defringe so the amount you

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.090 
matting and defringe so the amount you
use<00:03:57.299> off<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.780> gonna<00:03:57.900> make<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.290> more<00:03:58.709> severe

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
use off so you gonna make it more severe

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.870 
use off so you gonna make it more severe
so<00:03:59.250> if<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.370> use<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.670> 50<00:04:01.220> it's<00:04:02.220> good<00:04:02.430> give<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.819> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
so if I use like 50 it's good give it a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.979 
so if I use like 50 it's good give it a
fight<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> lot<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.540> still<00:04:03.690> done<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.840> really

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
fight a lot but it's still done a really

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.479 
fight a lot but it's still done a really
good<00:04:04.109> job<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.239> zoom<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:06.389> on<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.510> layer

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
good job to it zoom in on it layer

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.770 
good job to it zoom in on it layer
matting<00:04:08.519> defringe

matting defringe
it's<00:04:10.410> good<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> five

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
it's good a five

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.890 
it's good a five
and<00:04:13.580> there<00:04:13.670> we<00:04:13.730> go<00:04:13.760> it's<00:04:14.030> pretty<00:04:14.450> much<00:04:14.630> gone

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
and there we go it's pretty much gone

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.009 
and there we go it's pretty much gone
all<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.440> horrible<00:04:16.280> white<00:04:16.700> halo<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.299> edges<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
all the horrible white halo and edges to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.560 
all the horrible white halo and edges to
the<00:04:18.230> bush<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.620> gone<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:19.389> basically<00:04:20.389> just

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
the bush is gone it's basically just

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.430 
the bush is gone it's basically just
made<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.870> all<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.230> bit<00:04:21.380> more<00:04:21.639> realistic<00:04:23.380> if<00:04:24.380> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
made it all a bit more realistic if you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.620 
made it all a bit more realistic if you
want<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.620> know<00:04:24.710> how<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:24.950> did<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.310> little<00:04:25.630> nori

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
want to know how I did this little nori

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.240 
want to know how I did this little nori
I<00:04:26.690> guess<00:04:26.870> color<00:04:27.560> correction<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.010> just<00:04:28.190> a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
I guess color correction is just a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.930 
I guess color correction is just a
little<00:04:28.460> bit<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:29.020> nice<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.169> fact<00:04:30.410> bit<00:04:30.710> of

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
little bit of a nice of fact bit of

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.110 
little bit of a nice of fact bit of
sunlight<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.210> all<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:33.580> if<00:04:34.580> there's<00:04:34.790> another

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
sunlight and all that if there's another

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.640 
sunlight and all that if there's another
thing<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.960> shall<00:04:36.139> show<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.350> which<00:04:36.530> you

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
thing I shall show you which you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.620 
thing I shall show you which you
probably<00:04:36.860> didn't<00:04:37.100> know<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.340> either<00:04:37.580> it's<00:04:38.419> good

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
probably didn't know of either it's good

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.110 
probably didn't know of either it's good
color<00:04:38.960> lookup<00:04:39.350> so<00:04:39.680> color<00:04:39.950> lookup<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
color lookup so color lookup is one of

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.900 
color lookup so color lookup is one of
the<00:04:41.180> adjustments<00:04:42.190> if<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.280> wouldn't<00:04:43.490> use<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.639> I

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
the adjustments if you wouldn't use it I

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.610 
the adjustments if you wouldn't use it I
hardly<00:04:44.389> use<00:04:44.480> it<00:04:44.600> but<00:04:44.900> I've<00:04:44.990> started<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.410> use<00:04:45.440> it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
hardly use it but I've started to use it

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.470 
hardly use it but I've started to use it
now<00:04:45.740> because<00:04:45.800> it's<00:04:46.490> some<00:04:46.940> really<00:04:47.060> nice<00:04:47.270> color

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
now because it's some really nice color

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.690 
now because it's some really nice color
Corrections<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.190> basically<00:04:49.460> made<00:04:49.669> for

Corrections so it's basically made for

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.780 
Corrections so it's basically made for
3d<00:04:50.240> but<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.540> can<00:04:50.690> use<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.520> make<00:04:52.520> color

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
3d but you can use it to make color

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.850 
3d but you can use it to make color
correction<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.240> like<00:04:53.540> exactly<00:04:54.169> as<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.590> see
