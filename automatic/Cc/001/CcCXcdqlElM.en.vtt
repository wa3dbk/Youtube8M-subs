with<00:00:45.510> two<00:00:45.719> levers<00:00:46.110> even<00:00:46.710> though<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.190> those

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
with two levers even though it's those

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
with two levers even though it's those
two<00:00:47.940> lovers<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.770> block<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.809> it's<00:00:51.809> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
two lovers are on one block so it's it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.900 
two lovers are on one block so it's it's
very<00:00:52.530> simple<00:00:52.850> but<00:00:53.850> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.930> show<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
very simple but let me actually show you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
very simple but let me actually show you
how<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.719> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> footprints<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> all

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
how like kind of the footprints of all

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.639 
how like kind of the footprints of all
this<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> whole<00:01:00.780> thing<00:01:01.050> it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this so this is the whole thing it's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
this so this is the whole thing it's
very<00:01:02.160> compact<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.850> mean<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.960> whole

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
very compact I mean this is the whole

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.910 
very compact I mean this is the whole
entire<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:07.020> course<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.710> walkway

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
entire thing of course your walkway

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
entire thing of course your walkway
would<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
would be up here right here but it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.120 
would be up here right here but it
extends<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.220> nice<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.900> tracks<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.470> nice<00:01:13.799> i'm

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
extends out nice it tracks out nice i'm

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
extends out nice it tracks out nice i'm
not<00:01:14.460> sure<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.030> any<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.900> design

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
not sure if there's any any design

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.700 
not sure if there's any any design
similar<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
similar to this or kind of like this but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.420 
similar to this or kind of like this but
if<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.150> then<00:01:21.150> tell<00:01:21.930> me<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.830> i<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:22.979> give

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
if there is then tell me so i can give

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
if there is then tell me so i can give
that<00:01:23.460> person<00:01:23.729> credit<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.810> there's<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that person credit or if there's a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
that person credit or if there's a
better<00:01:25.229> design<00:01:25.619> than<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.340> my

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
better design than this but this is my

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
better design than this but this is my
design<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.619> how

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
design and let's actually get on to how

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
design and let's actually get on to how
you<00:01:28.829> make<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> start

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you make this so we're going to start

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
you make this so we're going to start
off<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.500> making<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.729> rows<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.390> i'm<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
off by making our rows so i'm going to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.460 
off by making our rows so i'm going to
do<00:01:33.960> three<00:01:34.729> rows<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:37.460> piss<00:01:39.470> redstone

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
do three rows like this piss redstone

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
do three rows like this piss redstone
torches<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.220> very<00:01:41.430> similar<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
torches right there it's very similar to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.770 
torches right there it's very similar to
the<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.009> watchamacallit<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.060> double

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the to the watchamacallit the double

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
the to the watchamacallit the double
piston<00:01:45.930> extender<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.950> triple<00:01:47.189> piston

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
piston extender and the triple piston

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.350 
piston extender and the triple piston
extender<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.299> without<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:48.930> wiring<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
extender but without as much wiring so

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.429 
extender but without as much wiring so
once<00:01:51.360> you're<00:01:51.479> done<00:01:51.630> doing<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.259> add

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
once you're done doing that you can add

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.120 
once you're done doing that you can add
more<00:01:52.890> blocks<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.430> top<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:54.000> torches<00:01:54.420> here

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
more blocks on top of these torches here

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
more blocks on top of these torches here
then<00:01:56.130> add<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:57.090> pistons

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
then add in pistons

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.390 
then add in pistons
right<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.350> then<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.220> want

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
right here and then you're going to want

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.660 
right here and then you're going to want
more<00:02:02.909> Pistons<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:04.440> here<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.460> going

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
more Pistons up here but we're not going

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.120 
more Pistons up here but we're not going
to<00:02:05.760> mess<00:02:05.940> with<00:02:06.119> these<00:02:06.299> top<00:02:06.510> pistons<00:02:06.920> just<00:02:07.920> yet

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
to mess with these top pistons just yet

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.029 
to mess with these top pistons just yet
okay<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:09.990> with<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.380> orange<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
okay right here with this orange will I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890 
okay right here with this orange will I
use<00:02:11.220> orange<00:02:11.580> wall<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.940> indicate<00:02:12.360> something<00:02:12.630> of

use orange wall to indicate something of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.960 
use orange wall to indicate something of
more<00:02:13.080> importance<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.819> add

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
more importance I'm you're going to add

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
more importance I'm you're going to add
repeaters<00:02:15.480> set<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:16.230> tick<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
repeaters set the one tick and have a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.059 
repeaters set the one tick and have a
line<00:02:17.520> coming<00:02:17.819> out<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.709> sticky<00:02:19.709> piston

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
line coming out like this sticky piston

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.420 
line coming out like this sticky piston
right<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> block<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
right there with a block right here and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.660 
right there with a block right here and
then<00:02:23.940> you're<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.270> want<00:02:25.400> repeaters<00:02:26.400> like

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
then you're going to want repeaters like

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
then you're going to want repeaters like
this<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.290> last<00:02:28.560> repeater

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
this and then on this last repeater

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.800 
this and then on this last repeater
you're<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.370> 1<00:02:29.700> i'll<00:02:30.480> write<00:02:30.630> their

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
you're going to have 1 i'll write their

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.479 
you're going to have 1 i'll write their
set<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.110> 2<00:02:31.380> ticks<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.190> you're<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.430> to

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
set to 2 ticks and then you're going to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.720 
set to 2 ticks and then you're going to
want<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:33.090> set<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> 2<00:02:33.660> chicks<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:35.550> one

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
want this one set to 2 chicks that one

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.290 
want this one set to 2 chicks that one
is<00:02:35.850> set<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.900> set<00:02:37.110> 2<00:02:37.230> 3<00:02:38.090> wire<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
is set to for this one set 2 3 wire it

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.830 
is set to for this one set 2 3 wire it
all<00:02:39.420> up<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.840> or

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
all up and then you can have that or

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
all up and then you can have that or
your<00:02:43.170> input<00:02:43.530> right<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:44.670> input<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.150> need

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
your input right here your input we need

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.210 
your input right here your input we need
it<00:02:45.600> wouldn't<00:02:45.930> need<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.230> drawn<00:02:46.560> from<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it wouldn't need to be drawn from the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.600 
it wouldn't need to be drawn from the
air<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.019> mean<00:02:49.230> by<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.040> you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
air so what I mean by that is that you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.699 
air so what I mean by that is that you
would<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:53.030> torch<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:55.410> right

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
would have to have a torch like right

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.080 
would have to have a torch like right
here<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.069> red<00:02:56.519> stone<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.800> yeah<00:02:59.190> but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
here in red stone right here so yeah but

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.880 
here in red stone right here so yeah but
as<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.600> see<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.230> double<00:03:01.590> piston

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
as you can see that's the double piston

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.420 
as you can see that's the double piston
extender<00:03:02.250> parts<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.650> want<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.250> be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
extender parts but now we want to be

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.250 
extender parts but now we want to be
able<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.640> control<00:03:05.940> these<00:03:06.269> top<00:03:06.780> pistons<00:03:06.989> and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
able to control these top pistons and

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.539 
able to control these top pistons and
actually<00:03:07.709> what<00:03:07.920> you're<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> need<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> do

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
actually what you're going to need to do

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.610 
actually what you're going to need to do
is<00:03:08.790> you're<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> need<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.440> replace<00:03:10.440> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
is you're going to need to replace that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.190 
is you're going to need to replace that
with<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:12.079> regular<00:03:13.400> piston<00:03:14.660> because<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.019> don't

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
with a regular piston because you don't

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.009 
with a regular piston because you don't
want<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.760> messed<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:18.840> let

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
want to have that messed up so then let

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.740 
want to have that messed up so then let
me<00:03:19.079> just<00:03:19.260> swap<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.329> it's<00:03:21.480> very<00:03:21.630> easy

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
me just swap out this so it's very easy

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.830 
me just swap out this so it's very easy
to<00:03:21.989> set<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.500> these<00:03:22.709> last<00:03:23.070> Pistons<00:03:24.060> here<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.540> of

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
to set up these last Pistons here and of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.360 
to set up these last Pistons here and of
course<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.320> ended<00:03:25.739> up<00:03:26.209> breaking<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.590> give

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
course I ended up breaking this so give

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.420 
course I ended up breaking this so give
me<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.850> second<00:03:30.390> okay<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:34.049> now<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
me one second okay so now we have that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.490 
me one second okay so now we have that
to<00:03:35.850> wire<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:36.660> all<00:03:36.870> we<00:03:37.019> need<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.380> is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
to wire this up all we need to do is

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.310 
to wire this up all we need to do is
take<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:38.190> box<00:03:38.640> or<00:03:38.940> bring<00:03:39.720> blocks<00:03:39.959> out<00:03:40.140> right

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
take to box or bring blocks out right

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.470 
take to box or bring blocks out right
here<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.040> put<00:03:41.670> torches<00:03:41.940> on<00:03:42.209> all<00:03:42.359> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
here and then put torches on all of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.870 
here and then put torches on all of
these<00:03:42.600> with<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.590> block<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.190> top<00:03:44.250> right<00:03:44.670> here

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
these with a block on top right here

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.289 
these with a block on top right here
like<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.959> okay<00:03:46.470> then<00:03:47.220> from<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:47.880> you're

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
like that okay then from here you're

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.920 
like that okay then from here you're
going<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.840> want<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.459> have<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.700> block<00:03:50.970> out<00:03:51.150> with

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
going to want to have one block out with

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.590 
going to want to have one block out with
gloss<00:03:52.890> on<00:03:53.070> right<00:03:53.220> here<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.640> glow<00:03:54.239> stone<00:03:54.420> is

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
gloss on right here and glow stone is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.770 
gloss on right here and glow stone is
used<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.640> kind<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.700> prevents<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.600> only

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
used because it kind of prevents it only

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.990 
used because it kind of prevents it only
allows<00:03:57.959> redstone<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.890> go<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.370> one<00:03:59.970> direction

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
allows redstone to go in one direction

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.470 
allows redstone to go in one direction
it's<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:01.040> diode<00:04:02.040> II<00:04:02.459> i<00:04:02.820> can't<00:04:03.299> pronounce

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
it's like a diode II i can't pronounce

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.840 
it's like a diode II i can't pronounce
it<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:03.959> i<00:04:04.320> know<00:04:05.010> i'm<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.700> get<00:04:05.790> a

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
it so i know i'm just going to get a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.820 
it so i know i'm just going to get a
comments<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.450> how<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.200> pronounce<00:04:07.560> it

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
comments on how you pronounce it

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.410 
comments on how you pronounce it
correctly<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.430> basically<00:04:08.550> acts<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
correctly but it basically acts like a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.690 
correctly but it basically acts like a
repeater<00:04:09.870> except<00:04:10.379> in

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
repeater except in

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.690 
repeater except in
stand<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.680> i'll<00:04:12.950> tell<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.370> what<00:04:13.670> i

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
stand so you can i'll tell you what i

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
there's one problem it gets stuck right

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.150 
there's one problem it gets stuck right
here<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.820> prevent<00:04:29.450> those<00:04:29.889> from<00:04:30.889> getting

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
here and to prevent those from getting

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.520 
here and to prevent those from getting
stuck<00:04:31.460> right<00:04:31.700> here<00:04:31.930> what<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.050> need<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.260> do<00:04:33.410> is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
stuck right here what we need to do is

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.300 
stuck right here what we need to do is
we<00:04:33.680> need<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.919> extend<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.570> pulse<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.310> this

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
we need to extend out the pulse on this

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.090 
we need to extend out the pulse on this
side<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.150> allows<00:04:38.419> us<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.919> whole<00:04:39.979> thing
