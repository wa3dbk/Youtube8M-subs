00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
for 2013 here's a ram 1500 and we really

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.369 
for 2013 here's a ram 1500 and we really
didn't<00:00:15.419> want<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.749> whole<00:00:15.990> lot<00:00:16.200> with<00:00:16.289> the

so<00:01:59.369> matter<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.639> fact<00:01:59.789> this<00:01:59.969> truck<00:02:00.209> is<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.450> line

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so matter of fact this truck is in line

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.969 
so matter of fact this truck is in line
with<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> coefficient<00:02:01.319> of<00:02:01.350> drag<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.740> closer

put<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.039> trip<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.670> truck<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
put on the trip that the truck is a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
put on the trip that the truck is a

exchanger heats up all the fluids so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.609 
exchanger heats up all the fluids so
allows<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.780> engine<00:02:09.930> everything<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.470> move

well<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.970> my<00:02:33.659> mom<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> always<00:02:34.110> take<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> trucks

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
well so my mom I always take the trucks

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.930 
well so my mom I always take the trucks
home<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.099> she<00:02:35.159> always<00:02:35.280> complains<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
home and she always complains that

home and she always complains that
there's<00:02:36.090> they're<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.629> high<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.049> hard<00:02:37.200> for

there's they're so high it's hard for
you<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.280> new<00:02:38.400> things

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you to get in but one of the new things
