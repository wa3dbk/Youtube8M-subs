lower<00:05:16.310> my<00:05:16.430> flame<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> little<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.480> put<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.260> at<00:05:18.380> a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
lower my flame a little I put it at a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.120 
lower my flame a little I put it at a
seven<00:05:19.420> so<00:05:20.420> you<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:20.750> go<00:05:20.960> checking<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.800> see

if you need more soy sauce I think I

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.610

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.700 

maybe<00:05:36.620> three<00:05:37.070> tablespoons<00:05:37.790> total<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.530> use

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
maybe three tablespoons total and I use

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.190 
maybe three tablespoons total and I use
the<00:05:39.890> low-sodium<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:40.850> always<00:05:41.840> use<00:05:42.020> the

a<00:05:44.900> little<00:05:45.140> bit<00:05:45.230> difficult<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:45.680> find<00:05:46.330> but<00:05:47.330> I

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
a little bit difficult to find but I

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.370

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
always use low sodium
