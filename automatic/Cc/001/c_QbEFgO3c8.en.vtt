00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 placebos 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.930
 We have crushed the onion and garlic 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.110
 observe his birth I see he had 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 we have cut very little 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.970
 and now we go to salar 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.970
 Y 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.430
 and everyone 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.789
 We have put a pot on the fire and 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.860
 we will add oil when it is well 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.219

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.219

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 when the tortilla is already a bit happy 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.820
 and we will wait for all authors 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.910
 sometimes 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:16.080
 when we see that the rib and the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 sausages are ready we will reserve 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.430
 in the same hot oil and we will leave 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.609
 Onion and Álvaro Pérez will give you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.379
 a few laps and we will put it into play 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.379
 short so we do not get burned 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.740
 we will add the chili pepper 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.200
 and we will stir well and now you have to 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.680
 get to know each other and get a good stir 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 soft 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.569
 when you see the onion and until the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.760
 golden always with very low heat 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.540
 so that they do not burn us we will throw the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.629
 fried tomato 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.629
 and 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.799
 We will remove so that everything is integrated 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.799
 I finished cooking 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.340
 It has already been a couple of minutes or three is 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.930
 the tomato that changes the color 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.790
 also having more dark 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.790
 we will pour the white wine 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.270
 we will remove 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.060
 and let's put some salt now with 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.730
 caution 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.970
 that we always put in him the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.970
 Pepper 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.069
 We also add in the cube 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.670
 I caudé 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.670
 since 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.430
 we will give a few laps so that it 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.680
 undo 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.680
 and now we're going to put the noodles 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.579
 we have not had more or less a minute and 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.650
 now we are going to put it point with the 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.370
 the term stance 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.370
 m 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.210
 and we add to the other casserole that is 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.210
 greater because if not in those that would be fine 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.160
 and the water that we have to do well 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.160
 hot 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.240
 we remove 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.990
 And I do not put the water all at once 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.820
 because I do not know what to send me to receive 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.920
 or is almost missing more then you 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.070
 we will make a success and now we are going to 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.820
 leave the most well covered and cool 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.820
 A) Yes 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.140
 it's already here we see ourselves 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.600
 boiled about 78 minutes this is who 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.460
 according to the manufacturer of the noodles you have 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.849
 than to follow it and it is better to leave it always 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.559
 a little bit al dente 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.779
 now we will put a little bit of 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.779
 chopped parsley when serving 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.790
 we will give a few laps and this always 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.520
 It is better that you let it rest about 5 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.979

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.879
