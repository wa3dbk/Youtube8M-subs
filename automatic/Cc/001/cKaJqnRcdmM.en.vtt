00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.750
 and there is nothing 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.750
 expense 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.419
 dívar 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.940
 He says 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.940
 yes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.200
 It is one of the most important 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.500
 prestigious of the USA and this year it 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.990
 he broke the absolute record obviously here 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.680
 they run all categories and different 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.630
 devices including prototypes that are 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 made especially for this race 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.260
 in fact 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 just the hyundai genesis with which 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.480
 he beat this record that has 700 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.850
 horses is a specially made car 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.490
 for this country climb 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.170
 a circuit that used to be all land 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.040
 in the time of ari vatanen there by the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.090
 90s to 35 90 and now it's 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 absolutely from country that was by the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.820
 another side that I had terrible because it's 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.850
 nothing happened not did not happen absolutely 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.930
 I do not know why but I say 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.539
 speedy good this just who 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.230
 broke all records with this coupe 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.500
 genesis where there is genesis 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.560
 it's about rhys millén and the on board 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 a hyundai genesis coupe the same car 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 with which his father roy miller had 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.000
 done very good time the previous year 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.820
 now with the same car chrysler beat 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.500
 the record I see it going slowly 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.210
 he wants me to tell him 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 but if that's how he broke the record 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.060
 I can not imagine if he grabs ari vatanen or 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.060
 do not 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.299
 slowly good in 2008 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 to 2 by now big said 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.610
 what's going on like me 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.830
 This is like me at my worst
