00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.490
 We have previously separated a form 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.910
 triangular in the front area observing 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.920
 the hair 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.930
 in the neck area we have left the 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.879
 hair in its natural fall and we have 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.429
 created a base of clips on the base of 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.990
 the neck we start the process separating 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.130
 the hair of the neck area in three 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.130
 Wicks and climbing 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.550
 we take out 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 we give loop shape to the wick 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.120
 directing it up and we hold it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.930
 with some clips on the base that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 we had formed 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 It is very important to hold the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 clips 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.280
 here we made a collection with volume 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 in the lower area of ​​the neck forming a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.510
 loop at the tips and carrying small 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
 tufts back from the area of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.989
 around the face with those who 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.910
 we made a drawing in the form of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.620
 arabesque to get a style 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 elegant at the same time as current 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.530
 once well secured the bed and polished 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.530
 well with the comb 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.830
 we open the loop to both sides 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.830
 holding with hairpins 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 the hair of the frontal area the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 we separate into wicks and prepare it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.810
 the beds to increase the fixation and 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.810
 work better the hair 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.510
 We comb and join with another table that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.510
 we also prepare slightly 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.070
 We comb the two wicks and the camos 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.459
 we are carrying the wick back the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.459
 Catching and polishing the very well 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.220
 we will give it the desired shape 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.080
 holding its end over the loop that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.680
 we had formed in the lower area of ​​the neck 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 with a clip 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.750
 we take a wick from the side lacquer 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 moss and combed to leave it very polished 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.930
 we twist the hair on itself 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.140
 to form a cake of soft with a lot 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.140
 movement 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.980
 the camos to fix and to polish 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.930
 very well the wick as the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 We crossed over the nape area 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.549
 we return to the face if necessary 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.420
 we form a ring at the end of 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.420
 loop that we hold with a fork 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.150
 we perform the same process on the side 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.550
 left we take the hair from the lateral 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.210
 what the camos and comb to take 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.640
 very polished back 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.940
 we are turning it on itself always 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.940
 upwards 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.020
 we camos and we are forming a thing of 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.350
 very polished that we crossed over the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.350
 previous 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.030
 we also form a ring that 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.870
 we will hold on the other end of the loop 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.870
 from the neck area 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.550
 we hold with a fork 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.030
 we hide the tips and the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.030
 camos to fix 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.870
 we take the hair that we have left in the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.050
 right side we take it out and polish it very 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.050
 all right 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.530
 we are twisting the hair on itself 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.889
 same always upwards forming another 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.889
 dorsal 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.200
 the changes 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.520
 we shape and integrated ring 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.470
 in the whole of the lower area of ​​nape 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.980
 hiding the ends well and holding 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.980
 with a clip 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.420
 we perform the same operation with the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:05.310
 hair on the opposite side of the bed and 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.310
 we are forming a highly polished cake 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.219
 we form a girl this time down and 

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:18.219
 we hold with some clips 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.490
 you can see in these planes the 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.050
 final result of this collected a 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.360
