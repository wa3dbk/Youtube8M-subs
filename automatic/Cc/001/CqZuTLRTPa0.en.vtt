00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:05.589
 the whole grenada area by a river and its network of gorges and quebradillas form 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.680
 Basin 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.129
 it limits it to a girl of peaks that is called sonia de aulas 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.889
 The watershed is supplied by rainwater and from 10 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.019
 the high parts or lack 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.890
 in this area small causes are formed that yesterday meeting comfer you need 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.110
 a place to deeper water courses 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.989
 and more intense activity 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.259
 that then end up feeding a collector or main cause in the part 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.259
 low which normally flows into the sea 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.020
 in the subsoil underground water currents circulate make up the mantle 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.160
 aquifer 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 This is formed mainly by the water of the same river and the rains that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.660
 it leaches more into its soil and recharges the aquifer in each rainy season 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 the vegetation was a very important role in this process 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.250
 acts as a kind of force that captures the waters what they will do 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.050
 slowly tail to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.340
 one of your countries 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.590
 in certain parts of the account the limestone rocks omitlan 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.060
 then he acts as an agent of his execution grazing as a result he exculpated 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 in tunnels caverns groups with stalactites and stalagmites 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.970
 so the Genoese club cristÃ³bal 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.590
 the account is our true living space 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.250
 because in it they settle and develop human activities 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.980
 constitutes judgment because it is physical in which internal 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.610
 stybar the natural elements man flora fauna water soil there 27 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.510
 and those generated by man economic activities two cities 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.800
 technology culture st 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.680
 nevertheless the same action of the man on basin we produce negative ducks 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.910
 of varying magnitude the quality of the water deteriorates 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.719
 zigzag finally causes 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.160
 environmental imbalances 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.360
 among others we have 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.080
 deforestation in high areas which produces erosion of investments 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.039
 contamination by residual surcharges and the population 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.200
 agrochemical protesters and pesticides 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.859
 of industry and mining 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:13.799
 toxics and chemicals that affect not only superficial courses but 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.729
 also to the subways ultimately to the oceans 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.829
 scarcity of the resource due to overexploitation of the sources of 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.099
 catering 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.929
 about grazing 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.909
 inefficiency of a giant 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.689
 creating competition with its use 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.889
 we need a culture of water preservation 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.619
 of a literacy and environmental this is to become actors year 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:44.079
 Realize the effect of transactions in this life space 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.409
 It is necessary to promote the use and rational use of the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.239
 resource 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.079
 so we will have a balanced environmental scenario where we can 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.999
 develop our activities in a harmonious way
