transferring heat in this moment now we

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
transferring heat in this moment now we
switch<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> cold<00:01:27.840> mode<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:29.189> can

into a blue color this means we are

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.780 
into a blue color this means we are
applying<00:01:35.640> coal<00:01:36.329> into<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.400> metal<00:01:38.400> hydride

now we turn off the solution and the the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.130 
now we turn off the solution and the the
unit<00:01:48.810> stops<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:49.829> working<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.600> process

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
unit stops from working and the process

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.910 
unit stops from working and the process
