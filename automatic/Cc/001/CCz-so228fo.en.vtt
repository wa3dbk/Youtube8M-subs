00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 chaves caves number 19 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.570
 Now I am eben alamilla player 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.750
 fifth year capita in 2015 runner 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.120
 number 27 and andres salgado number 81 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.930
 receiver fourth year strong closing 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.710
 with a very intense final 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 it was a championship at home and good 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.509
 the obligation to earn it here with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.420
 position with all the people who supported 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.130
 the stadium is that it was a huge game 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 existence 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.590
 I think it was your more extensive than the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.690
 match of the end of 2010 that was equal 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.090
 here at home and it feels good not to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 win it with your people win it here in the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 college 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.290
 and I think we owe it to the fans not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.090
 win a champion against 15 because in 2013 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 we earn it there and it's different not to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.899
 win him a visit 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 to win it here not against fiction and you 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 people do it was it was a good match and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.009
 it was a good close is something is something father 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.350
 the truth is that our goal from 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.270
 the year since 2013 that we are 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 champions 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 was to be two-time champions then the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 truth is that that was a goal that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 we had from the beginning already 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.259
 established and it was something for which 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 we were working I say another of the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 goals was like the final at home and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.579
 to be undefeated was not something that was not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.649
 we had been able to achieve or previous years 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.509
 and that this was something that also 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.759
 we had very much in mind then the taste 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.429
 a victory does not taste good but does not know 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.469
 well nothing more let's say it for the year 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.869
 past that both champions this is already a 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.119
 new year and the truth is that right now 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.649
 we do not have that taste of victory if 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 we do not want more we do not want another 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.060
 championship for this school that has 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.860
 given so much is it and as every year 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.909
 we always prepare for the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.709
 championship 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.079
 all teams want to be champions 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.360
 but you have to work for it we 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.099
 we work since since December we have 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.319
 a week of rest two weeks at 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.239
 a lot and we are already running again and 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.520
 in the gym and everyone's goal 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.909
 the years since 2008 has been the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.970
 championship every year the championship 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.210
 the objective is clear in the championship and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.220
 well we have a goal 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.690
 of memory that is the party of 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
 preparation you're going to see in texas 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.740
 against the Lutheran University of Texas 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.410
 and then good is a commitment that already 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.450
 is agreed and good is going to be first of 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.670
 this year and the team is already thinking about 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 that we are already preparing with a 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690
 mind 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.780
 in winning that game in texas 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.690
 it's better than closing it by combining a 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.670
 cycle that has taken me all my life I 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.819
 I have been playing since I was 6 years old, this is my last 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.920
 season 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.580
 I liked knowing how to close it with a 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.260
 championship close it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 giving everything 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.580
 dismissing less of the colors of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.860
 team in the best way I can 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.200
 this is an important and good 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.680
 Enjoy it a lot because it's important 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.140

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.480
 ejects let's go fast is important 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.200
 enjoy all this that ends very 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.530
 Quick 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.990
 Well, good memories are left forever 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.760
 Well, if it's good, the truth is that the 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.140
 Unam has a soccer program 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.260
 very very large child 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.510
 because all the staff is made up 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.250
 by major league players and some 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.920
 Major league cars and this is this 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.959

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.010

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.870
