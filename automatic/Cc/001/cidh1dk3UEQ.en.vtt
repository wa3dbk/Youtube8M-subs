00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.280
 cold to stop cooking 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:09.240
 so then you see the skin recedes 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 very easily and we will cut we go 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.360

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.560
 make a nice presentation down we go 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.750
 keep the last phalanx level of 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.729
 the reception have heated a stove or 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.930
 a wok with a small knob of butter 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.200
 during this time we will chisel 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200
 onions 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.080
 I had to sweat onions 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:15.180
 understanding that the onions su on goes 6 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.220
 bind them so now we will incorporate 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.080
 garlic 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.350
 while it sucks we will squeeze the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.660
 lemon the acidity of lemon will us 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.390
 wake up a little poorly buds 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:42.130
 prepared a little bit of small end scenes 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:45.190
 little pepper curry tip in this 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.370
 not bad case these tests the body here a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 little udders it's okay you're counting the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:58.110
 taste of ice cream and lemon juice on 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.110
 will put lotto max 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.890
 so give you a little bit of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 salt that little pepper and we go 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 incorporate our 10 centilitres of 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.340
 chicken broth 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.010
 as soon as it shivers we put the shrimp 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.950
 and we will reduce 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.090
 that's the temperature because otherwise 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.290
 but shrimp 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.340
 we would be retracted from three 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.470
 minutes like that to this sweet and we're going 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.740
 address that why not in 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.180
 glasses 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.180
 I always go on volumes 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.900
 now it's very easy to 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.900
 make an action shrimp curry
