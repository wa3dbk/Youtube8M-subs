00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.550 
second it goes so yeah trapping just and
they're<00:03:09.550> getting<00:03:09.700> evolution<00:03:10.660> strategy<00:03:11.260> with

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
they're getting evolution strategy with

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.430 
they're getting evolution strategy with
Ursaring<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.700> scissors<00:03:13.570> or<00:03:13.630> bullet<00:03:14.020> punches

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
Ursaring and scissors or bullet punches

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.300 
Ursaring and scissors or bullet punches
I'm<00:03:14.620> guessing<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:16.500> banded<00:03:17.500> because<00:03:18.130> you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I'm guessing it's banded because you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.440 
I'm guessing it's banded because you
know<00:03:18.460> it's<00:03:18.610> doing<00:03:18.940> this

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.050 

and<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.110> discharged<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.760> doesn't

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and I use discharged and it doesn't

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.670 
and I use discharged and it doesn't
knock<00:03:24.209> out<00:03:24.420> either<00:03:24.630> them<00:03:25.020> as<00:03:25.200> expected

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
knock out either them as expected

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.449 
knock out either them as expected
because<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.280> know<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.920> would<00:03:29.370> have

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
because you know you know I would have

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.660 
because you know you know I would have
had<00:03:29.610> way<00:03:29.910> more<00:03:29.940> damage<00:03:30.360> done<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.050> and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
had way more damage done in there and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.600 
had way more damage done in there and
first-string<00:03:32.670> uses<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.180> kid<00:03:33.800> I<00:03:34.800> can't

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
first-string uses for kid I can't

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.890 
first-string uses for kid I can't
believe<00:03:35.819> I<00:03:35.880> said<00:03:36.090> that's<00:03:36.270> all<00:03:36.390> about<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.720> not
