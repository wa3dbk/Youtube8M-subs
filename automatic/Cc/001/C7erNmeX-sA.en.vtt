00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.559
 you tried something else not always 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.570
 whole sane through were going on 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.760
 the years were testing me from other 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 positions but always my position was 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.220
 forward some funny memory the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.659
 that you have had in concentrations 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.259
 travels 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.720
 once agreement when we went to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.310
 rionegro a trip that made me 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.929
 caught between everything and as I am a 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.300
 hairy I wanted to shave all the 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:23.179
 legs and they could not because start the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.030
 clean leg for all your dad you some 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.649
 kind of advice such I always do that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.289
 see me correct me the mistakes of the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.899
 matches and for another match I try to 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.940
 improve it if that is us 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.289
 I always try to improve what I do wrong 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 in a game for the other you can 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.820
 do it well and the technicians who 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.800
 rescues so far from the ones you had 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.740
 in the technicians well they always teach you 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.540
 something new they try to put what is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.820
 on earth and through have passed 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.680
 two years the technicians making fall of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.680
 more size says valentine new things do not 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.150
 I think that when this fourth arrives or 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.860
 reservation you already have to have practically 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.210
 everything known and there the technicians no longer 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.580
 they intervene so much but tactically 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.440
 where yes no more in the game and in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.350
 way of the game that they go to play the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.209
 team believes that the return of ramón them 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
 gives out a plus knowing that he 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.590
 fixed both indoors I think that with 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.500
 the turn ramón all the boys what 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.790
 they make brakes we motivate because we give ourselves 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.070
 he realizes that he is very aware of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.989
 inferior also the technical reserve is 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.900
 fixed a lot and for now they are being 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.850
 many reserve kids first and in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.320
 February was booked so it's a 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.060
 extra motivation because we know that the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.010
 day tomorrow for being anybody 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.410
 of us as we will have every day 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.750
 thinking about the future 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.450
 and in trying to train me leaving everything in 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.420
 every practice knowing that there is 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
 the number of events at all times and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.420
 that at any time you can upload 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.100
 then you have to leave everything 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.990
 enchantment and in every game to 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.970
 so that tomorrow if someone 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.430
 come and give you to be ready for and 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.020
 apt to rise were born in mexico

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.060
 her and if it's better I'd like to play the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.820
 selection there would be a dream but missing 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.860
 I 'm still a boy and I'd love fire 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.430
