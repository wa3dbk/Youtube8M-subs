from the ponytail and divide it into

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.019 
from the ponytail and divide it into
three<00:00:25.890> equal<00:00:26.189> sections<00:00:28.340> with<00:00:29.340> these<00:00:29.550> sections

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
three equal sections with these sections

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
three equal sections with these sections
just<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> regular<00:00:30.900> 3<00:00:31.170> strand<00:00:31.199> braid<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.890> the

way down grab an elastic band and tie
off<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.000> braid<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:39.420> move<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> braid<00:00:39.960> aside

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
off the braid now move the braid aside

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.750 
off the braid now move the braid aside
and<00:00:40.530> divide<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> rest<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.399> hair<00:00:41.550> into

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and divide the rest of your hair into

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.860 
and divide the rest of your hair into
three<00:00:42.090> equal<00:00:42.239> sections<00:00:47.420> now<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
three equal sections now that you have

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
three equal sections now that you have
three<00:00:49.140> equal<00:00:49.379> sections<00:00:49.620> bring<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> braid

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
three equal sections bring the braid

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
three equal sections bring the braid
back<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> position<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> second

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
back and position it as the second

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
back and position it as the second
strand<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.879> sure<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> second

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
strand and make sure it's the second

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
strand and make sure it's the second
strand<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> position<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> braid

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
strand because the position of the braid

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.970 
strand because the position of the braid
is<00:00:56.820> important<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
is important for this like so now you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
is important for this like so now you
should<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> total<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.789> four<00:01:00.059> strands

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
should have a total of four strands

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
should have a total of four strands
including<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> braid<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
including the braid and I'm not going to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
including the braid and I'm not going to
label<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.520> by<00:01:02.550> numbers<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.629> get

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
label them by numbers because it can get

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
label them by numbers because it can get
confusing<00:01:03.930> instead<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> label<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
confusing instead I'm going to label the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.460 
confusing instead I'm going to label the
leftmost<00:01:05.939> strand<00:01:06.210> outer<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> rightmost

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
leftmost strand outer and the rightmost

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
leftmost strand outer and the rightmost
strand<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.159> turn<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> must<00:01:09.869> start<00:01:10.140> with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
strand in turn so you must start with

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
strand in turn so you must start with
the<00:01:10.439> inner<00:01:10.619> strand<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the inner strand you want to take it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
the inner strand you want to take it
place<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> underneath<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> Strand<00:01:13.470> next<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
place it underneath the Strand next to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.090 
place it underneath the Strand next to
it<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.720> place<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.080> over<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> braided

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it and then place it over the braided

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.999 
it and then place it over the braided
strand<00:01:17.689> if<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> follow<00:01:19.110> me<00:01:19.380> correctly<00:01:19.799> your

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
strand if you follow me correctly your

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
strand if you follow me correctly your
third<00:01:20.280> strand<00:01:20.640> should<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> braid<00:01:24.140> now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
third strand should now be the braid now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.100 
third strand should now be the braid now
take<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> outer<00:01:25.799> strands<00:01:26.460> place<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
take the outer strands place it over the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.039 
take the outer strands place it over the
Strand<00:01:28.619> next<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.840> underneath<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
Strand next to it and underneath the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.590 
Strand next to it and underneath the
braid<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> braid<00:01:33.090> should<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.390> moved

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
braid so now the braid should be moved

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600 
braid so now the braid should be moved
back<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.140> its<00:01:34.290> original<00:01:34.409> position<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
back to its original position which is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
back to its original position which is
second<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.150> place<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> just

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
second in place and from here you just

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
second in place and from here you just
want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> repeat<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> exact<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.119> steps<00:01:39.360> take

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
want to repeat the exact same steps take

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
want to repeat the exact same steps take
the<00:01:40.320> inner<00:01:40.470> strand<00:01:40.890> place<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> underneath<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the inner strand place it underneath and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.940 
the inner strand place it underneath and
then<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> outer

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then over now go back to the outer

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
then over now go back to the outer
strands<00:01:47.399> place<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.159> under

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.800 

okay<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:54.010> more<00:01:54.100> time<00:01:54.370> under<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:56.370> over<00:02:00.810> over

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
okay one more time under and over over

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.240 
okay one more time under and over over
and<00:02:03.450> under<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.380> complete<00:02:05.740> opposite

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and under so it's the complete opposite

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.340 
and under so it's the complete opposite
on<00:02:06.430> one<00:02:06.640> side<00:02:06.940> you're<00:02:07.180> doing<00:02:07.480> under<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:07.990> over

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
on one side you're doing under and over

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.200 
on one side you're doing under and over
and<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.740> other<00:02:08.830> side<00:02:09.160> you're<00:02:09.340> doing<00:02:09.640> over<00:02:09.820> and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
and the other side you're doing over and

it<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> bit<00:02:30.010> repetitive<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.850> not<00:02:31.030> as

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
it is a bit repetitive but it's not as

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.090 
it is a bit repetitive but it's not as
bad<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> fishtail<00:02:32.200> braid<00:02:32.440> zag<00:02:32.710> can<00:02:32.950> get

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
bad as the fishtail braid zag can get

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.700 
bad as the fishtail braid zag can get
really<00:02:33.370> repetitive<00:02:34.050> when<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.140> reach<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.560> end

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
really repetitive when you reach the end

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.320 
really repetitive when you reach the end
grab<00:02:36.010> an<00:02:36.130> elastic<00:02:36.550> band<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.000> tie<00:02:37.180> off<00:02:37.300> the

grab an elastic band and tie off the
braid<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.080> add<00:02:38.230> volume<00:02:38.470> simply<00:02:39.100> tug<00:02:39.400> on

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
braid and to add volume simply tug on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.760 
braid and to add volume simply tug on
your<00:02:39.640> braids<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.900> will<00:02:40.990> also<00:02:41.140> create<00:02:41.620> this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
your braids and it will also create this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.130 
your braids and it will also create this
little<00:02:42.100> swirl<00:02:42.460> effect

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.420 

so<00:02:48.140> here's<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.410> close-up<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> braid<00:02:49.190> I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so here's a close-up of the braid I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.830 
so here's a close-up of the braid I
think<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:49.970> unique<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
think it's really unique because of the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.270 
think it's really unique because of the
braid<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.170> middle<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:52.250> can

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
braid in the middle and you can

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.980 
braid in the middle and you can
accessorize<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> flower<00:02:53.420> clip<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:53.900> I'm

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
using one from MC and here's the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.770 
using one from MC and here's the
completed<00:02:56.600> look<00:02:56.840> as<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.050> side<00:02:57.410> braid<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:58.780> second

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
completed look as a side braid a second

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.060 
completed look as a side braid a second
way<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.020> wear<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.410> braid<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.860> by

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
way you can wear this braid is by

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.340 
way you can wear this braid is by
braiding<00:03:01.340> half<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.850> hair<00:03:02.060> only<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.840> because

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
braiding half your hair only and because

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.930 
braiding half your hair only and because
it's<00:03:03.530> half<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.710> braid<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.550> be<00:03:04.670> smaller

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
it's half a braid is going to be smaller

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.460 
it's half a braid is going to be smaller
so<00:03:05.180> don't<00:03:05.330> forget<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.600> tuck<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.020> your<00:03:06.140> hair<00:03:06.290> for
