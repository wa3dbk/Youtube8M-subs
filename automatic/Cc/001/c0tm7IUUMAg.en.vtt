00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.160
In college I realized that, I feel like I’ve
been put here for the greater good 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.340
It’s definitely been an adventure, for me at least because I’ve been down so many different paths

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.640
 I knew that once I had that NASA opportunity
become available that was what I was going to do

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.120
 If we all work as a community and each one teaches one then no one person gets left behind 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.320
Everyone is very involved in the community and a lot of the work that the school does comes from the community

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Growing up a lot of my best friends didn’t have father figures in their lives 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.960
and I feel like a lot of them would have been able to go through college had they had better role models

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.260
so I want to be that figure, I want to be
that person to do that for the little guys and girls that come across me in the classroom 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.000
there was this one boy, in the beginning of the year he barely mumbled to anybody, spoke under his breath, and wouldn’t read anything

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.400
and by the end of the year he
won the reading award from his teacher

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:06.820
and he came to me with his award and he’s like shaking it my face “Mr.S, Mr. S, Can you believe it? I won the reading award! 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.320
and it made me cry, it made my cry

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.060
Being a girl in tech myself, I was able to
get together with my other female classmates

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.800
And come up with a program where, young students like ourselves could find mentors 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.300
We actually held an event at UWM
We had guess speakers come in and share their

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.060
experiences with being women in technology
We also had a networking session with fellow women in tech

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.360
It’s definitely been a positive experience because now I have the tools I need in order to achieve my goals in the future 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.119
Growing up I always wanted to work for NASA
I thought being able to go to space was really

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.560
cool So the android app that I developed at
NASA, “ACAS” they call it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.400
Advanced Caution and Warning System. It was designed specifically for a tablet and that

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.590
allowed astronauts to take the tablet around
the spacecraft or the international space

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.119
station and help diagnose system failures
And you know allows them to make these decisions

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.260
on site, in real-time
and they’re not having to constantly communicate

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.369
with mission control down in Huston it’s
very exciting to know that something that

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.329
I worked really hard on over the summer
is going to be potentially utilized for these future missions  

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.640
She really helped me realize that my life experiences were valuable and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.920
if I looked at my experiences as strength
as opposed to a weakness then there was nothing that I wouldn’t be able to do 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.360
that kind of motivated me and propelled me

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.620
Now I’m an honor’s student, and I’ve
also been a student success advocate for Lawton scholarship recipients 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.280
as well as being a recipient myself 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.400
Something that has really been stressed in a lot of my classes at UWM is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.560
take what you know and go further. 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.420
When children, when families are struggling there’s usually a lot of different pieces that go into that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.870
Lack of support, lack of resources in the
community and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.240
in social work you look at the person,
the family, the community as a whole 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.440
To work to figure out how to help solve problems. It can be challenging and there are times when

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.010
there’s definitely things that just don’t
work out, but when you see people begin to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.700
be connected with new support systems, new
resources that can help them

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.910
It’s really rewarding to see the changes
that can happen
