00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.990 
back up to here and you see that a
little<00:01:22.290> joystick<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:23.159> move<00:01:23.909> around<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
little joystick will move around the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.399 
little joystick will move around the
options<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.659> let's<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> training

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
options so let's just put on to training

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.060 
options so let's just put on to training
push<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:32.930> choose<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> character<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> choose

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
someone to fight against just go through

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.340 
someone to fight against just go through
all<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.909> i<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.570> go

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
all of this so as you can see i can go

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
all of this so as you can see i can go
left<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:49.100> top<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> down<00:01:52.610> buttons<00:01:53.610> are

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
left right top up and down buttons are

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.969 
left right top up and down buttons are
working<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:55.310> all<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.640> modes<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:58.110> go

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
working for all the modes so you can go

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.300 
working for all the modes so you can go
a<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.219> hard<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.729> one-handed<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
a bit hard to do this one-handed but so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.639 
a bit hard to do this one-handed but so
you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.670> play<00:02:03.570> your<00:02:03.840> game<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> put

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you can play your game so you can put

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.960 
you can play your game so you can put
any<00:02:04.799> Game<00:02:05.520> Boy<00:02:05.700> Advance<00:02:05.729> game<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.630> here

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
any Game Boy Advance game in here

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.630 
any Game Boy Advance game in here
the<00:02:08.930> slot<00:02:09.290> of<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.410> back<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:10.160> actually

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the slot of the back is actually

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.740 
the slot of the back is actually
probably<00:02:11.030> big<00:02:11.510> enough<00:02:11.770> if<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.950> wanted<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
probably big enough if you wanted to to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.450 
probably big enough if you wanted to to
fit<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.880> gameboy<00:02:17.020> regular<00:02:18.020> game<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.530> there<00:02:18.740> just

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
fit a gameboy regular game in there just

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.130 
fit a gameboy regular game in there just
depends<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.180> what<00:02:20.360> game<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.870> want<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> yeah

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
depends on what game you want so yeah

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740 
depends on what game you want so yeah
I've<00:02:24.320> got<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.710> switch<00:02:25.040> working<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
I've got the switch working and the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.030 
I've got the switch working and the
joystick<00:02:27.260> has<00:02:27.440> probably<00:02:27.710> been<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.920> hardest

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
joystick has probably been the hardest

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.270 
joystick has probably been the hardest
bit<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.300> I've<00:02:29.530> worked<00:02:30.530> out<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.860> best<00:02:31.040> way

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
bit but now I've worked out the best way

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850 
bit but now I've worked out the best way
of<00:02:31.310> doing<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.120> nice<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.480> easy<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.350> you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
of doing that it's nice and easy and you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.760 
of doing that it's nice and easy and you
