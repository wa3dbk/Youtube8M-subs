00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.789
 or friends 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.320
 welcome the program 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.640
 @ lfg teacher 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.659
 from Monday to Friday always a topical theme for you 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.270
 We are going today. 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.050
 proceed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.800
 with those tips from the psychologists of the university of california 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.840
 in 12 of them 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.780
 who are giving tips 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.080
 d cuba 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.390
 mist 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 deco not studying 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.000
 and as an accomplice 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.040
 The informations 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.620
 already last week we have approached the theme in our two programs 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.600
 on here 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.210
 today we will continue 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 with other new tips tips 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.720
 for example 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.130
 you must not study 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.130
 It's always the same with this all the time. 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.410
 things with stories 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.750
 you should study 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.700
 together 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 parallel to the same time 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 because 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 this makes it easier to understand 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.060
 I play 6 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 we've been saying since last week 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 that these new tips 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.120
 of the psychologists of the University of California 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.740
 are very relevant 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.520
 and that we should 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.850
 at least 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.130
 test them 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 Let's test them 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.930
 already last week 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.040
 It's ours we talked about a tip they were 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.200
 which totally conflicts with what we have always done 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.680
 we said 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.780
 always study from the same place in the place change take a quiet place and 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.810
 restful 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.710
 because they evoke what facilitates by memorization 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.880
 with the understanding that for certain 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.650
 the psychologists 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 in California 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.860
 they say the opposite 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.820
 do not study in the same place 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.939
 study one day that d or a week that the other week I read 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.549
 because the brain 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:14.629
 When 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.569
 it goes to a different place Elisiane feather more if open more 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.849
 it's so so 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.609
 is that the first conclusion 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.619
 and now 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.689
 the second tip 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.060
 we should not study 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.760
 the same discipline 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.059
 ever 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.669
 easy study 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.199
 all that is correlate 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.329
 for example 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.729
 If you're a law student 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.289
 study for example right through the hall together with criminal procedural law 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.649
 possibly with a constitutional right 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:48.819
 it's in the studies 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.879
 related matters 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.869
 facilitates understanding 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.619
 seemed to give the impression that the brain 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:01.219
 when you study different things keeley santana more 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.009
 the brain connects more 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.590
 he starts doing 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.590
 the correlations the convictions 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.829
 the advantage of studying two have this privilege in parallel 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.829
 it's the beliefs you start to make 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.609
 connections 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.290
 of full sms with that discipline 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380
 at this point because he other 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.969
 and so on 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:32.469
 psd wants it to be another tip that the psychologists of the University of 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.409
 California 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.030
 not stupid 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.120
 I did not stay 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.419
 intensely in a single matter 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.439
 better is your brain 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.119
 stroll around with various things 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.739
 however several things do not mean all things careful 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.779
 go slow 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.249
 take things only correlated 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.489
 correlated 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.709
 You're not going to get another one now. You said have these all in one day. 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.329
 is not it 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.040
 take channel get final portions ai yes only has correlation 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.470
 It is well there that comes the tip 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.740
 this awesome fantastic tip 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.180
 I'm already giving all these tips. 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.939
