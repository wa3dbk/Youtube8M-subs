days<00:02:52.930> we've<00:02:53.230> had<00:02:53.500> worse<00:02:54.400> where's<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> 90<00:02:55.569> days

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.680 
days we've had worse where's the 90 days
r<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.319> 60<00:02:56.739> days<00:02:59.790> there's<00:03:00.790> another<00:03:01.000> 15<00:03:01.480> day

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
r is the 60 days there's another 15 day

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.199 
r is the 60 days there's another 15 day
I<00:03:01.930> guess<00:03:02.680> those<00:03:02.890> are<00:03:02.920> cool<00:03:03.280> if<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.880> lot<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
I guess those are cool if I get a lot of

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.059 
I guess those are cool if I get a lot of
them<00:03:04.450> there<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.140> go<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:07.560> don't<00:03:08.560> subscribe<00:03:08.739> to

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
them there we go I don't subscribe to

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.020 
them there we go I don't subscribe to
the<00:03:09.310> idea<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.819> people<00:03:10.269> who<00:03:11.340> buy<00:03:12.340> more<00:03:12.640> NX

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
the idea that people who buy more NX

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.449 
the idea that people who buy more NX
have<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.079> higher<00:03:14.320> chance<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.280> better

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
have the higher chance to get better

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.680 
have the higher chance to get better
poles<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.739> don't<00:03:17.739> think<00:03:17.950> that's<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.310> case<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.940> do

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
poles I don't think that's the case I do

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.140 
poles I don't think that's the case I do
think<00:03:20.230> however<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.680> people<00:03:21.340> who<00:03:21.579> buy<00:03:21.820> more

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
think however that people who buy more

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.479 
think however that people who buy more
an<00:03:22.269> X<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> greater<00:03:23.709> chance<00:03:23.799> at<00:03:24.220> seeing

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
an X have a greater chance at seeing

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.240 
an X have a greater chance at seeing
those<00:03:24.820> poles<00:03:25.299> simply<00:03:26.260> because<00:03:26.620> they<00:03:26.890> bought

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
those poles simply because they bought

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.960 
those poles simply because they bought
more<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.700> them<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.250> will<00:03:30.430> agree<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.790> you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
more of them that I will agree to you

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.590 
more of them that I will agree to you
entirely<00:03:32.010> that's<00:03:33.010> logical<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.820> my<00:03:33.970> opinion<00:03:34.239> so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
entirely that's logical in my opinion so

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.259 
entirely that's logical in my opinion so
you<00:03:35.440> know<00:03:37.620> I'll<00:03:38.620> ds1<00:03:39.100> days
