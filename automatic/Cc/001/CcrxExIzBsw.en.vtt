right<00:04:19.859> there<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.250> first<00:04:20.430> one<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.910> my

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
right there in the first one in my

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.850 
right there in the first one in my

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
opinion probably like I said partial is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.210 
opinion probably like I said partial is
outfit<00:04:26.310> because<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.210> had<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> figure<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.860> him<00:04:29.100> in

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
outfit because I had a figure of him in

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.800 
outfit because I had a figure of him in
a<00:04:29.280> selfie<00:04:29.669> all<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> kids

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
a selfie all the kids

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.779 
a selfie all the kids
that's<00:04:31.440> probably<00:04:31.650> well<00:04:31.889> a<00:04:32.160> lot<00:04:32.280> more<00:04:32.400> partial

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
that's probably well a lot more partial

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.029 
that's probably well a lot more partial
this<00:04:32.940> outfit<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.630> didn't<00:04:34.440> actually<00:04:34.560> see<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
this outfit I didn't actually see the

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.610 
this outfit I didn't actually see the
super<00:04:35.729> stores<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.840> came<00:04:37.110> out<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.530> this

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
super stores that that came out and this

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.830 
super stores that that came out and this
outfit<00:04:37.979> on<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:39.090> definable<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:39.660> based

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
outfit on and it's definable it's based

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.070 
outfit on and it's definable it's based
on<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:40.260> also<00:04:40.380> up<00:04:40.710> saw<00:04:41.039> reruns<00:04:41.700> of<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.840> you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
on but also up saw reruns of that so you

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.900 
on but also up saw reruns of that so you
know<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.860> moment<00:04:44.039> doesn't<00:04:44.340> mean<00:04:44.610> as<00:04:44.760> much

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
know so that moment doesn't mean as much
