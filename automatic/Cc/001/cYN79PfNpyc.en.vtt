time<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.960> saw<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> while<00:00:52.500> i<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.710> using<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
time you saw the while i was using it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.090 
time you saw the while i was using it
was<00:00:53.250> turning<00:00:53.610> red<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.530> slowly

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
was turning red to do that was it slowly

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
was turning red to do that was it slowly
only<00:00:56.460> eating<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.780> stop<00:00:58.140> firing<00:00:58.469> for

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
only eating it you just stop firing for

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.380 
only eating it you just stop firing for
a<00:00:58.949> second<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.399> it'll<00:00:59.640> cool<00:00:59.789> down<00:00:59.850> enough<00:01:00.090> for

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a second and it'll cool down enough for

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
a second and it'll cool down enough for
you<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> again<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> laid<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you to use it again but if you laid it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.470 
you to use it again but if you laid it
completely<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.180> you're<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
completely over here you're going to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
completely over here you're going to
wait<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.960> longer<00:01:03.989> than<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.850> cause

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
wait much longer than if you just cause

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
wait much longer than if you just cause
they<00:01:06.090> grow<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> don't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
they grow if you just like if you don't

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
they grow if you just like if you don't
just<00:01:07.950> keep<00:01:08.159> holding<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> trigger<00:01:08.909> button

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> machine<00:01:09.630> gun<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> sense

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
with the machine gun so you get a sense

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.359 
with the machine gun so you get a sense
to<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> forever<00:01:12.860> okay<00:01:13.860> i<00:01:13.890> believe<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to use it forever okay i believe that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
to use it forever okay i believe that
all<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.970> hooker<00:01:15.270> caught<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:17.189> we

all the hooker caught me and see how we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.480 
all the hooker caught me and see how we
can<00:01:17.490> rescue<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> stuff<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> like

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
can rescue and stuff so it's like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
can rescue and stuff so it's like
they're<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> gamefly<00:01:21.570> took<00:01:21.869> too<00:01:22.020> much

you can a beer you can have an educated

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.390 
you can a beer you can have an educated
guess<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> where<00:04:07.560> things<00:04:07.799> might<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.040> like
