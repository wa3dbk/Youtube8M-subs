00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 This is the steelseries her wireless one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.390
 decent wireless gaming headset 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 compatible with a good number 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.280
 platforms that you and sea point one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.139
 surround sound gives the gaming headset 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.870
 weighs 297 grams 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.300
 he is completely piano black with orange 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 accents and yes it is really beautiful 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 designed and he is very sorry 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 pleasant on the head 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 thanks to the soft lining here on the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.920
 headband and also thanks to the ear pads 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 that are equipped with memory foam and that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 So that means over time 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.880
 sit nicely in the shape of your ears 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.670
 well you also see that on the earcups and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.829
 volume buttons so that you just yourself 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.030
 can arrange all of that very quickly 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.719
 he also has the on and down there 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 switch and two connections 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.430
 for the xbox chat cable 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.379
 and also a connection to another 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.379
 connect headphones so that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 you both go to the same gaming 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 can listen to sound or for example 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.090
 the same music on the other ear cups 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.589
 do you have the extendable microphone and me 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 will now put the gaming headset on 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.770
 then you have a bit of an idea how 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.750
 looks like 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.729
 it's just really saying really bad 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.950
 nice and is really an honor 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.290
 headset is really all about your ears 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 then we go to the channel 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.490
 you must connect this channel to the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 mains voltage and at the back you see 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 that it has an analogue in om 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.259
 one for example to connect with you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 tablet or your television but you can too 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 connect to your TV via the optical 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 connection 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.409
 he also has a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 USB connection to connect it directly 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.829
 connect to your PC for example 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 but of course the optical connection 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.280
 and the usb connection are also there for 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 intended to connect it to a 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 playstation 3 4 or xbox 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.640
 well you also see that it has 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 an optical old that sits here completely 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.149
 on the sides and actually all 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.570
 cables you need to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.600
 connect to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.270
 console or so are on your PC 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.550
 included with the product now very nice 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 I found the display of the channel itself 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.240
 everything becomes really beautiful in it 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.460
 displayed when you press the volume button 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 then you can for example also you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.390
 set audio you see there 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.090
 for example chat mix a chat mix car 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.850
 determine the volume of your chat 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.380
 compared to the volume of your game 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.140
 the live nothing is really handy 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.490
 because it is easy to adjust 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.260
 how loud the volume of your chat 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 automatically when the is spoken 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.050
 and therefore also that volume of your game 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.730
 then automatically goes down 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.709
 well you can determine the i-cube and that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.800
 can switch dobby on and off 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.050
 and you can also find one yourself in the menu 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.150
 create profile you can determine your hum 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 and also you can in options you can 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.320
 for example thea the brightness of you 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.459
 display to the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.950
 gaming headset really gives one 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.080
 professional sound virtual 7 point one 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 surround and that means when on 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.370
 am gaming with this gaming headset on that 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.110
 the sound really seems to be from all sides 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.420
 come and you 're really in the middle of it 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.030
 he also supports dolby digital and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.370
 dolby pro logic 2x and despite that 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 wireless is I had no problems at all 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.830
 for example latency i have some 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.260
 jars 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.450
 played the battlefield, and yes I had 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 so really not bothered by this delay 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.160
 so that's really ideal about this one 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560
 Steel series on a wireless gaming headset 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.600
 well the two also got your batteries 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.220
 one of those batteries that are also in 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.360
 the earcup 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.519
 also sees how easy it is to use the cover 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.190
 can get off and on it could again 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.470
 and the other battery that you can 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.299
 just charge it in the transmitter itself 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.549
 you here so while gaming 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.910
 Then you can just use the other battery 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.860
 charge and you will never be stuck with one 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.630
 empty battery 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.549
 how you connect it to your console 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.280
 in the booklet that comes with it too 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.470
