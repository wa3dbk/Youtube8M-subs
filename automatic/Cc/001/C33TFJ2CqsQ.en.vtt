00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.840
 Good evening, most wanted kitchen goes today 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.330
 we will prepare lasagna or fruitarians 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.690
 hygienists it is a very recipe 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.910
 simple and fast and impressive 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.890
 regarding the pricing there 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.050
 you need a mixer or better yet a 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.579
 very powerful blender a mandolin 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.410
 optional potato peeler if you want 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.680
 keep the peel of the courgettes 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.059
 no need is a coppapasta better if of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.040
 rectangular shape 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.530
 as for the ingredients there 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.950
 two beautiful lasagna are needed 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.899
 zucchini with bells for the bechamel sauce 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.180
 we will use the pulp of a lawyer and a lawyer 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.210
 small yellow pepper 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.299
 as far as the sauce is concerned we will do it 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.969
 with 4 tomato sauce and 50 grams of 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.369
 rehydrated dried tomatoes we pass 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.590
 immediately to the preparation and we cut the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.259
 end parts of the courgettes after 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.619
 obviously having them washed then we deprive 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.439
 with the potato peeler the zucchini of 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.659
 peel is an optional step not it 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.909
 we are doing to make the appearance more 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.649
 similar to lasagna we are pushing ourselves 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.810
 a little more in depth than respect 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.159
 peel to obtain lasagna 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.479
 whiter for a visual effect 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.459
 best 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.039
 obviously the skins and other waste 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.229
 We'll use them for other recipes 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.119
 cut the courgettes in half because they are 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.909
 a little twisted and therefore we want 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.590
 facilitate cutting with the mandolin le 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.289
 we will use being a portaria recipe in 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.049
 Genes are so natural to not raw 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.639
 marinate those who prefer it can hesitate 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.579
 for four hours 

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:57.380
 here after having made some lasagna 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.590
 from zucchini we pass immediately to 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.179
 preparation of the sauce then 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.889
 let's break the tomato even so 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.130
 they are grossly doing it 

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:12.020
 even without cutting just for 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.970
 aim for absolute speed 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.880
 dry with kitchen paper i 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.950
 dried tomatoes that we kept in 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:26.090
 soaking we break even with the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:29.230
 scissors fly and enjoy everything if there is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.720
 you need it and drain the sauce for 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.930
 remove excess liquid we can 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.480
 move to preparation in the da 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.170
 chanel then we slice the pepper 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.450
 yellow 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 we laugh the pepper as always gods 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 filaments and seeds we cut it touches 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.910
 let's put the avocado we don't dig too much 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.800
 to not pick up the green part in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 this way we do not alter the color 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.900
 natural of béchamel we enjoy away 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.180
 we got this consistency 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.610
 quite compact but I easily 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.340
 flammable protee zucchini a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.840
 ready lasagna the béchamel sauce ready on 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.760
 subject we have to do this 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.980
 point that we assemble now put the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.870
 coppapasta on the plate we remember that if 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.220
 rectangular shape not square like 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.530
 ours is much better 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.959
 let's proceed in this way if you want 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.330
 follow a literal translation of the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.890
 traditional lasagna as we will do at 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.040
 unfortunately detriment to the effect 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.100
 color first place the béchamel sauce e 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.860
 then the sauce and if not for the benefit 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.440
 of aesthetics put the zucchini one 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.810
 very thin layer of bechamel sauce 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.910
 it is still a very thin layer of sauce 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.280
 in this way the lasagna will be noticed 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.890
 better with the method we are following 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.800
 we the sauce is a little mythicize 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.720
 too zucchini do three states with the 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.870
 method you prefer and close with the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.000
 gravy we can take away from the cup is enough 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.530
 well in the riale fruit are ready 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.050
 as you have seen it was a 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.020
 very simple and fast recipe 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.630
 the only ingredient we used 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.180
 dried tomatoes are possible 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.820
 buy quietly even already 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.470
 dried if you have no fisherman or if 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.049
 you don't feel like them carli 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.700
 in the sun well good food more wanted by 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.700
