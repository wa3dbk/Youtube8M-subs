00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello my dear with you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.719
 teacher of those a expert ege 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.900
 tutor Alexey Eduardovich 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.029
 recently wrote down the decision of such here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:26.390
 tasks to find the smallest, see the reference 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 on youtube flight can not be such here 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 charging math not me yes today 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.370
 I wanted to tell you how to determine which 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 number rational rationality 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 translated from Latin means reasonable 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 but it says nothing of course really 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 On gia this means that there are no roots 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 at least for grade 9 on your 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.170
 level it sounds like this 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.440
 that is, it is necessary to determine in which case 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.359
 if everything is as simple as root 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 will be answered by some guys 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.250
 difficulty even with solving square 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 equations the other day me is one smart guy 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 wrote that he wants to deal with me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 skype because he is lazy to walk 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.909
 dark winter evenings to start 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 suits get this puzzle 3 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.790
 in the wake of our lessons, I decided to write 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.250
 By the way, try this video yourself. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.030
 determine where there will be no root in principle 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 I already told you the most important clue 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.140
 to have a viewing effect so you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.170
 remember how to solve try it yourself 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.829
 at first you just go wrong but if you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.899
 for example , guess yourself too 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.970
 effect because emotional shake 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.149
 easy ac and anal stress always 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.250
 promotes good memorization and here 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.760
 I also wanted to say that I must 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.380
 repeat new information which 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.460
 important to you then there is something again 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.620
 I learned a lesson such as some new 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.720
 information that you would like to remember 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.440
 An hour or so after five six seven 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.150
 be sure to repeat 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.600
 something similar to solve someone 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.250
 tell can be just for skinny 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.410
 end 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.580
 re-read then remember 80 percent 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.770
 she will remember this recent discovery for 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.940
 who gave my Nobel Prize 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 colleagues from Massachusetts 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.750
 Institute of Technology here no not 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.870
 I collaborate online by skype testing 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.780
 their students not only in math and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.050
 physics on and in english site one more 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.610
 English teacher . 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.360
 if you have questions, call us 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.670
 phones 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.070
 from faith another wrote bottles for you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.230
 on the wall without an edge on me solution 11 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.209
 we are engaged on skype though she 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.519
 in fact not so much by skype as 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.360
 on the virtual board 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.030
 virtual interactive whiteboard such 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.530
 a site where you can draw 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.790
 interactions nica type drove dot com 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.000
 We talk through mikrofonchik very 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 convenient every day for 15 minutes was drunk 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.480
 and a hedgehog to learn everything and cheap 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.980
 15 minutes but still half an hour tanks 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.190
 some task to sell 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.170
 why is he so great good news on 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:45.310
 back erasing code like qatar and this one 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:50.230
 move my skype write down the solution exactly 11 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.500
 a and c and h and n and the food was along with 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.820
 but the phone will write something to fence 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 classes are paid but if questions 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.830
 specific types prompt check it out 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.960
 short and inexpensive project 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:09.300
 he see if the brackets open here 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:14.160
 root multiply by root more minus 3 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.560
 multiply by 3 minus 9 there is this garbage 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.959
 on this bullshit 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.200
 shrinking tap minus 3 root Russians 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.630
 roots you don't even need to remember the shape 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:31.170
 although some girls immediately say that 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:34.380
 This FSB they so this of issue 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.300
 I do not know what this taste he has 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
 girls usually know this formula 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 reduced multiplication not to think 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.100
 girls usually think they don't like 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.170
 football player by the way, too, for those who 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.120
 thinks this way is normal too 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.030
 the main thing is that you just need to memorize a draw 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.190
 that's all multiplied everything turns out 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 there is no root understand that it means 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.690
 cafe that has rational clouds and 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.120
 means mathematics rational number 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.380
 like that you can always belong 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.010
 irrational number 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.760
 that is, there is no rational root 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.300
 personally generally fractional type there are three 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.310
 the first minus the first three did not catch but 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.230
 here obviously roots will be because 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.600
 then the root is squared off 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.180
 denominator is not there is no such big 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.300
 brackets there were small conditions brackets 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.000
 what that is, it turns out 5 years root 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.620
 and nothing shrinks until the end of this 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.780
 will not disappear soon no matter how you try 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.610
 to remove 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.500
 By the way, it's clear that once a single number 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.570
 irrational means rest hardly 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.090
 will be rational for dumping try 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.180
 that there was one correct answer only 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.169
 same chip this root multiplies by 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.580
 root is obtained root well, more precisely, from 15 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.350
 it is not removed so it remains 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.210
 it is naturally necessary to multiply the bracket 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.240
 on the bracket just like here 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.780
 it turns out there is a root of 6 on the root of 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.620
 6 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.930
 it's 6 minus 3 minus three centuries 9 minus 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.150
 on minus will be plus yes and still there 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.480
 such bullshit natanze 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.250
 soon multiplied by 33 by the root there and 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.230
 so it turns out minus twice 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:18.480
 work this root it spoils everything 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.090
 You know how to say spoils if 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.170
 here this root of the number we would have 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.060
 dilemmas, that is, it is not clear what to do 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.430
 whether there is rational here 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.190
 rationally we could not choose how 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.840
 Buridan's ass between two 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.090
 correct answers so thank god 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.200
 that only one answer is correct 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.740
 says that we really 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.310
 forces chased botan correctly decided 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.620
 puzzle i hope you have questions 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:50.420
 call back and see 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.420
