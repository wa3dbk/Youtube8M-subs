today I'm gonna show you where to get
all<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.049> prime<00:00:04.290> warframes<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.250> are

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
all the prime warframes that are

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.639 
all the prime warframes that are
currently<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.390> game<00:00:06.540> but<00:00:07.200> before<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> start

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
currently in the game but before I start

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.950 
currently in the game but before I start
of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> video<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.519> need<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.820> explain<00:00:09.179> rotations

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
of the video I need to explain rotations

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.830 
of the video I need to explain rotations
for<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.849> endless<00:00:12.179> game<00:00:12.570> modes

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
for you so all the endless game modes

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.340 
for you so all the endless game modes
for<00:00:13.139> warframe<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:14.509> rotations<00:00:15.509> alright<00:00:16.199> they

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
for warframe have rotations alright they

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
for warframe have rotations alright they
have<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> tier<00:00:16.920> based<00:00:17.190> system<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.940> based<00:00:18.420> on

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
have a tier based system and based on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
have a tier based system and based on
the<00:00:18.750> rotation<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.350> will<00:00:19.680> get<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> different

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the rotation you will get a different

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.050 
the rotation you will get a different
tier<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.970> reward<00:00:21.420> these<00:00:22.350> rotations<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.430> B

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
tier of reward these rotations are a B

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.689 
tier of reward these rotations are a B
and<00:00:24.330> C<00:00:25.050> alright<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.609> I'm

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and C alright so this is what I'm

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.890 
and C alright so this is what I'm
talking<00:00:27.060> about<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> I'll<00:00:27.630> say<00:00:27.869> something

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
talking about and I'll say something

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.439 
talking about and I'll say something
like<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:29.039> drops<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.670> tower<00:00:30.090> three

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
like and this drops from tower three

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.380 
like and this drops from tower three
survival<00:00:31.109> rotation<00:00:32.070> C<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> same

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
survival rotation C and it's the same

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
survival rotation C and it's the same
for<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.110> endless<00:00:34.320> game<00:00:34.649> modes<00:00:34.920> alright

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
for all the endless game modes alright

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.979 
for all the endless game modes alright
if<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> void<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> auto

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
if you go into the void or the auto

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.979 
if you go into the void or the auto
Kundera<00:00:37.530> lacked<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.340> rotations<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.540> always

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
Kundera lacked the rotations will always

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.240 
Kundera lacked the rotations will always
go<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.950> B<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.120> C<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.410> five<00:00:43.770> minutes<00:00:43.980> in

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
go a a B and C so five minutes in

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.819 
go a a B and C so five minutes in
survival<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.090> ten<00:00:45.809> minutes<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.230> survival<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
survival is a ten minutes in survival is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
survival is a ten minutes in survival is
a<00:00:47.000> fifteen<00:00:48.000> minutes<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.390> survival<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.899> B<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
a fifteen minutes in survival is B and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
a fifteen minutes in survival is B and
twenty<00:00:50.160> minutes<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> survival<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.149> C<00:00:51.390> after

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
twenty minutes in survival is C after

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
twenty minutes in survival is C after
that<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.559> will<00:00:52.680> repeat<00:00:52.949> itself<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.489> 25<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that it will repeat itself so 25 is a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.709 
that it will repeat itself so 25 is a
thirty<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.559> thirty<00:00:56.190> five<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> B<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> forty

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
thirty is a thirty five is B and forty

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
thirty is a thirty five is B and forty
is<00:00:57.870> C<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.890> defense

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is C and for defense

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.790 
is C and for defense
it<00:00:59.520> goes<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.000> five<00:01:00.270> wave<00:01:00.629> increments<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.500> five

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it goes in five wave increments of five

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
it goes in five wave increments of five
waves<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.609> ten<00:01:03.329> waves<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.049> fifteen<00:01:04.860> waves

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
waves is a ten waves is a fifteen waves

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.420 
waves is a ten waves is a fifteen waves
is<00:01:05.280> B<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> twenty<00:01:06.689> waves<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.200> C<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> hope

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
is B and twenty waves is C so I hope

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
is B and twenty waves is C so I hope
that<00:01:08.640> cleared<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.330> any<00:01:09.570> confusion<00:01:10.020> about

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that cleared up any confusion about

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.460 
that cleared up any confusion about
rotations<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.240> void<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.200> first

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
rotations in the void and the first

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
rotations in the void and the first
frame<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.100> gonna<00:01:14.189> take<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
frame we're gonna take a look at is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
frame we're gonna take a look at is
Excalibur<00:01:15.750> Prime<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> unfortunately<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.250> you

don't<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.060> Excalibur<00:01:18.689> Prime<00:01:18.930> already<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
don't have Excalibur Prime already you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
don't have Excalibur Prime already you
cannot<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:21.030> him<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> reward<00:01:22.470> for
