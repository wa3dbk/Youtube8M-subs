one<00:00:00.659> other<00:00:00.930> scale<00:00:01.230> that<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.469> kind<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.460> would

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
one other scale that is kind of I would

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.130 
one other scale that is kind of I would
really<00:00:03.030> necessarily<00:00:03.360> talk<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.689> scale<00:00:03.990> I'm

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
really necessarily talk about scale I'm

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.180 
really necessarily talk about scale I'm
more<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> talk<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.950> particular

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
more going to talk about a particular

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.789 
more going to talk about a particular
note<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.150> just<00:00:06.420> seems<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.109> pop<00:00:07.259> up<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.529> lot<00:00:07.710> in

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
note that just seems to pop up a lot in

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.820 
note that just seems to pop up a lot in
rockabilly<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.900> sixth<00:00:10.260> basically

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
rockabilly it's it's the sixth basically

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.509 
rockabilly it's it's the sixth basically
so<00:00:11.150> minor<00:00:12.150> or<00:00:12.450> major<00:00:13.040> we'd<00:00:14.040> be<00:00:14.190> looking<00:00:14.309> at

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
so minor or major we'd be looking at

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.740 
so minor or major we'd be looking at
this<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.509> natural<00:00:15.690> six<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.660> for<00:00:18.660> example

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
this as the natural six so for example

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.620 
this as the natural six so for example
let's<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> minor<00:00:19.859> pentatonic<00:00:23.539> but<00:00:24.539> I'm

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
let's do a minor pentatonic but I'm

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.019 
let's do a minor pentatonic but I'm
going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> throw<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.080> 16<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.640> both

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
going to throw that 16 in them in both

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to throw that 16 in them in both
scenarios<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> lower<00:00:27.810> octave<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
scenarios in the lower octave and the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:42.549 
scenarios in the lower octave and the
higher<00:00:28.590> octave<00:00:36.410> very<00:00:37.410> common<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.829> rockabilly

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.810 

so<00:00:43.559> there's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> blues<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.670> as

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
so there's a bit of blues in that as

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
so there's a bit of blues in that as
well<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.239> Oh<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.649> I'll<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.950> I'll<00:00:47.039> run

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
well so Oh what I'll do is I'll run

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
well so Oh what I'll do is I'll run
through<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> couple<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.760> licks<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.899> those

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
through a couple of licks over those

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.910 
through a couple of licks over those
higher<00:00:49.980> three<00:00:50.340> strings<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.620> let's<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
higher three strings so let's use that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.599 
higher three strings so let's use that
natural<00:00:53.399> seat<00:00:57.379> again<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> based<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
natural seat again this is based on the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
natural seat again this is based on the
pentatonic<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> build<00:01:00.870> from

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
pentatonic and we're going to build from

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.750 
pentatonic and we're going to build from
that<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.380> we're<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that so now what we're going to do is to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.830 
that so now what we're going to do is to
add<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> borrow<00:01:09.659> from

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
add to this we're going to borrow from

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:21.210 
add to this we're going to borrow from
the<00:01:09.960> blue<00:01:10.140> scale<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.260 

yeah<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.490> might<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.820> would<00:01:22.910> have<00:01:23.000> noticed

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
yeah so you might you would have noticed

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.920 
yeah so you might you would have noticed
the<00:01:23.600> second<00:01:23.990> time<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.440> included<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.340> f-sharp

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
the second time I included the f-sharp

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.590 
the second time I included the f-sharp
from<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.680> natural<00:01:28.010> six<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.180> Blues<00:01:32.420> know

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
from the natural six and the Blues know

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.450 
from the natural six and the Blues know
so<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.170> gets<00:01:33.320> more<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.710> more<00:01:33.770> rockabilly<00:01:34.340> as

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so it gets more and more rockabilly as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.310 
so it gets more and more rockabilly as
you<00:01:34.580> sort<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.540> add<00:01:35.720> all<00:01:36.200> these

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
you sort of you know add all these

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.350 
you sort of you know add all these
flavors<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:39.910> okay<00:01:40.910> so<00:01:41.000> I'm<00:01:41.090> gonna<00:01:41.150> run

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
flavors to it okay so I'm gonna run

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:52.690 
flavors to it okay so I'm gonna run
through<00:01:41.510> that<00:01:41.540> really<00:01:41.750> slow<00:01:50.560> okay<00:01:51.560> now<00:01:51.950> what

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
through that really slow okay now what

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.190 
through that really slow okay now what
we're<00:01:52.880> gonna<00:01:52.970> do<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.450> we're<00:01:53.750> gonna<00:01:53.810> borrow

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
we're gonna do is we're gonna borrow

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.100 
we're gonna do is we're gonna borrow
from<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.010> major<00:01:55.190> pentatonic<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.870> that

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
from the major pentatonic so that that

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.250 
from the major pentatonic so that that
minor<00:02:03.410> minor<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.430> major<00:02:04.580> third<00:02:05.000> movement<00:02:05.300> or

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
minor minor to major third movement or

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.690 
minor minor to major third movement or
basically<00:02:06.680> we're<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:07.070> from<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.280> c2<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
basically we're going from a c2 a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.460 
basically we're going from a c2 a
c-sharp<00:02:10.360> very<00:02:11.360> common<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.900> rockabilly<00:02:12.320> in

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
c-sharp very common in rockabilly in

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.230 
c-sharp very common in rockabilly in
fact<00:02:12.740> that's<00:02:12.890> something<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.790> hit<00:02:13.970> quite<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
fact that's something you hit quite a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.290 
fact that's something you hit quite a
lot<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.370> let's<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.910> build<00:02:17.150> that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
lot so let's I'm going to build that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.230 
lot so let's I'm going to build that
lick<00:02:17.709> just<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.800> go<00:02:18.950> over<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.280> again<00:02:19.340> we're

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
lick just to go over that again we're

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.110 
lick just to go over that again we're
basically<00:02:23.050> natural<00:02:24.050> 6<00:02:24.350> although<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.610> note

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
basically natural 6 although that note

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.430 
basically natural 6 although that note
added<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> minor<00:02:27.080> pentatonic<00:02:29.440> we're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
added to the minor pentatonic we're

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.900 
added to the minor pentatonic we're
gonna<00:02:30.530> add<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.770> blues<00:02:31.130> note<00:02:31.370> from<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.730> minor

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
gonna add the blues note from the minor

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.820 
gonna add the blues note from the minor
pentatonic<00:02:32.090> blues<00:02:37.360> go<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.810> sea<00:02:39.650> there

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
pentatonic blues go to the the sea there

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.500 
pentatonic blues go to the the sea there
or<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> minor<00:02:40.340> third<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.209> minor

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
or the minor third of the minor

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.910 
or the minor third of the minor
pentatonic<00:02:41.660> scale<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.220> we're<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> roll

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
pentatonic scale and we're going to roll

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.470 
pentatonic scale and we're going to roll
onto<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.100> major<00:02:46.430> 3rd<00:02:47.800> finish<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.010> route

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
onto the major 3rd finish on the route

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.979 
onto the major 3rd finish on the route
so<00:02:51.519> probably<00:02:52.519> for<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.120> more<00:02:53.269> beginners

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
so probably for the the more beginners

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.080 
so probably for the the more beginners
out<00:02:54.170> there<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.610> make<00:02:55.880> something

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
out there just to just to make something

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.740 
out there just to just to make something
clear<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:57.590> sort<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.890> really<00:02:58.070> want<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> work

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
clear we sort of really want to work

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.020 
clear we sort of really want to work
either<00:02:59.750> towards<00:03:00.290> or<00:03:00.560> around<00:03:00.830> excuse<00:03:01.760> me<00:03:01.880> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
either towards or around excuse me the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.509 
either towards or around excuse me the
route<00:03:02.209> no<00:03:05.410> ok<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.709> very<00:03:06.980> important<00:03:07.489> to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
route no ok so it's very important to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.240 
route no ok so it's very important to
know<00:03:07.700> where<00:03:08.120> those<00:03:08.269> root<00:03:08.510> notes<00:03:08.690> are<00:03:09.250> because

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
know where those root notes are because

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.500 
know where those root notes are because
that's<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.610> mean<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.790> where<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.180> sort<00:03:11.390> of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
that's I mean that's where we sort of

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.660 
that's I mean that's where we sort of
want<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> start<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.200> finish<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.739> one<00:03:13.400> sense

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
want to start and finish in one sense

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.270 
want to start and finish in one sense
not<00:03:14.269> all<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.420> time<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.930> sounds<00:03:15.560> quite<00:03:15.769> good

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
not all the time it sounds quite good

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.370 
not all the time it sounds quite good
too<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:17.150> avoid<00:03:17.390> finishing<00:03:17.810> on<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.019> sometimes

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
too to avoid finishing on that sometimes

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.259 
too to avoid finishing on that sometimes
but<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:19.010> very<00:03:19.459> good<00:03:19.519> anchoring<00:03:20.090> rule

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
but it's a very good anchoring rule

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:28.050 
but it's a very good anchoring rule
anyway<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.550> is<00:03:22.670> where<00:03:22.820> we're<00:03:22.940> at<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.060> far

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.070 

all<00:03:29.060> right<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:29.390> I'm<00:03:29.450> gonna<00:03:29.600> try<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:29.960> do<00:03:30.050> that

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
all right now I'm gonna try and do that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.170 
all right now I'm gonna try and do that
in<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> lower<00:03:30.590> octave<00:03:31.060> shouldn't<00:03:32.060> be<00:03:32.150> too

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
in the lower octave shouldn't be too

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.930 
in the lower octave shouldn't be too
hard<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.230> we'll<00:03:33.410> go<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.650> can<00:03:39.860> see<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
hard so we'll go so you can see that the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.610 
hard so we'll go so you can see that the
more<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.570> more<00:03:41.720> we<00:03:41.810> fill<00:03:42.020> it<00:03:42.050> in<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.350> more<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
more the more we fill it in the more it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.500 
more the more we fill it in the more it
sort<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:42.860> starts<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.820> look<00:03:43.940> like<00:03:43.970> quite<00:03:44.480> a

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
sort of starts to look like quite a

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.980 
sort of starts to look like quite a
complex<00:03:45.410> scale<00:03:45.770> but<00:03:46.130> in<00:03:46.940> essence<00:03:47.420> it's<00:03:47.690> a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
complex scale but in essence it's a

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.660 
complex scale but in essence it's a
range<00:03:48.320> of<00:03:48.500> simple<00:03:48.890> things<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.310> makes<00:03:49.550> it

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
range of simple things that makes it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.130 
range of simple things that makes it
that<00:03:49.850> way<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.090> oh<00:03:52.480> that's<00:03:53.480> mine<00:03:53.750> minor

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
that way so oh that's mine minor

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.280 
that way so oh that's mine minor
pentatonic<00:03:58.330> minor<00:03:59.330> pentatonic<00:03:59.690> with<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
pentatonic minor pentatonic with the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.250 
pentatonic minor pentatonic with the
natural<00:04:00.560> six<00:04:00.950> added<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.910> also<00:04:02.120> for<00:04:02.840> them<00:04:02.990> for

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
natural six added it's also for them for

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.570 
natural six added it's also for them for
the<00:04:03.380> theory<00:04:03.800> nuts<00:04:03.980> out<00:04:04.130> there<00:04:04.160> obviously

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the theory nuts out there obviously

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.030 
the theory nuts out there obviously
that's<00:04:05.510> got<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.720> real<00:04:05.900> Dorian<00:04:06.320> flavor<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.860> as

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
that's got a real Dorian flavor to it as

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's got a real Dorian flavor to it as
well<00:04:07.870> which<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:08.900> basically<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.410> minor<00:04:09.650> scale

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
well which is basically a minor scale

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:18.479 
well which is basically a minor scale
with<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> natural<00:04:10.250> six<00:04:11.980> now<00:04:12.980> if<00:04:13.100> we<00:04:13.250> were<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.430> add

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.460 

adding<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.580> blues<00:04:19.790> note<00:04:20.030> there<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:21.230> both

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
adding the blues note there in both

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.690 
adding the blues note there in both
octaves<00:04:27.460> sharp<00:04:28.460> natural<00:04:29.950> 6555<00:04:30.950> which<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.640> the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
octaves sharp natural 6555 which is the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.050 
octaves sharp natural 6555 which is the
blues<00:04:31.910> note<00:04:32.710> for<00:04:36.070> now<00:04:37.070> I'll<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.790> with<00:04:37.880> the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
blues note for now I'll do it with the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.950 
blues note for now I'll do it with the
natural<00:04:38.600> third<00:04:39.160> added<00:04:40.160> in<00:04:41.090> an<00:04:41.480> ascending

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
natural third added in an ascending

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:54.820 
natural third added in an ascending
motion<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:52.070> may<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.400> fish<00:04:52.610> that
