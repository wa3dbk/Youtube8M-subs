00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we and how it all works I'm going to try

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
we and how it all works I'm going to try
and<00:01:28.350> keep<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.920> short<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.340> possible<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
try and just have a brief discussion of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
try and just have a brief discussion of
why<00:01:33.840> I've<00:01:33.900> taught<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.100> cons<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.610> rather

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
why I've taught put these cons in rather

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
why I've taught put these cons in rather
than<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.390> debt<00:01:36.869> does<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.409> etcetera

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
than what debt does and etcetera

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.789 
than what debt does and etcetera
etcetera<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:39.750> stop<00:01:39.990> saying<00:01:40.259> etc

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
etcetera and I should stop saying etc

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.870 
etcetera and I should stop saying etc
etc<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> honestly<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.320> works<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.130> I've

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
etc so honestly how it works is I've

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
etc so honestly how it works is I've
made<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> very<00:01:45.720> heavily<00:01:46.229> around<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
made it very heavily around the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
made it very heavily around the
destruction<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> artifact<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.299> there's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
destruction of the artifact so there's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.310 
destruction of the artifact so there's
always<00:01:49.310> something<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:52.140> ways

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
always something what can do it the ways

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
always something what can do it the ways
I<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.909> double

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
I have to do this are the double

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
I have to do this are the double
cyclones<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.689> prefer<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.590> MSD<00:01:56.070> because

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
cyclones I prefer these over MSD because

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
cyclones I prefer these over MSD because
you<00:01:56.880> saw<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> double<00:01:57.600> destruction<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you saw get a double destruction so you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
you saw get a double destruction so you
can<00:01:58.560> take<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.979> something<00:01:59.340> rate<00:01:59.520> control<00:01:59.850> as

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
can take out something rate control as

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.109 
can take out something rate control as
well<00:02:00.030> upon<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.600> own<00:02:01.610> you'll<00:02:02.610> find<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
well upon your own you'll find that this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.770 
well upon your own you'll find that this
is<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.540> efficient<00:02:04.140> most<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> time<00:02:05.780> doc

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is more efficient most of the time doc

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
is more efficient most of the time doc
calls<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> nice<00:02:07.320> obviously<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.979> know<00:02:08.129> why

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
calls a nice obviously you know why

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
calls a nice obviously you know why
wouldn't<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.879> dark<00:02:09.239> hole<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

this<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:57.120> funny<00:04:57.420> because<00:04:57.690> it's<00:04:57.960> almost<00:04:58.200> like

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
this this funny because it's almost like

this this funny because it's almost like
artifacts<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.340> a<00:05:00.150> new<00:05:00.330> evilswarm<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.320> that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
artifacts of a new evilswarm and that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.540 
artifacts of a new evilswarm and that
sort<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.250> wid<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:02.760> sort<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.290> comparison<00:05:04.550> but

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
sort of a wid and sort of comparison but

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.510 
sort of a wid and sort of comparison but
my<00:05:05.850> reasoning<00:05:06.450> is<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.830> they<00:05:07.830> have<00:05:08.070> sort<00:05:08.490> of

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
my reasoning is that they have sort of

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.370 
my reasoning is that they have sort of
got<00:05:08.730> their<00:05:08.910> own<00:05:09.090> little<00:05:09.500> interesting<00:05:12.380> XYZ

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
got their own little interesting XYZ

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.260 
got their own little interesting XYZ
which<00:05:13.620> can<00:05:13.890> be<00:05:14.010> perceived<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.790> quite<00:05:15.030> powerful

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
which can be perceived is quite powerful

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.890 
which can be perceived is quite powerful
against<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.230> matter<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.800> minute<00:05:17.900> because

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
against the matter of a minute because

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.430 
against the matter of a minute because
it<00:05:19.770> stops<00:05:20.130> stuff<00:05:20.700> like<00:05:20.880> judgement<00:05:21.870> dragon<00:05:21.960> no

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
it stops stuff like judgement dragon no

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.830 
it stops stuff like judgement dragon no
problem<00:05:22.980> anything<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:24.060> comes<00:05:24.360> up<00:05:24.540> against

problem anything it comes up against

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.500 
problem anything it comes up against
it's<00:05:25.110> just<00:05:25.320> like<00:05:25.760> most<00:05:26.760> time<00:05:27.060> it'll<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.390> an

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
it's just like most time it'll have an

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.800 
it's just like most time it'll have an
answer<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:29.120> artifacts<00:05:30.120> just<00:05:30.270> mainly<00:05:30.510> we'll

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
answer to it artifacts just mainly we'll

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.880 
answer to it artifacts just mainly we'll
just<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.170> no<00:05:31.670> no<00:05:33.230> because<00:05:34.230> we're<00:05:34.410> sort<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.770> in

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
just so no no because we're sort of in

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.100 
just so no no because we're sort of in

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
quite a trap heavy format there's quite

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.500 
quite a trap heavy format there's quite
a<00:05:37.140> lot<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.530> on<00:05:37.680> floating<00:05:37.950> around<00:05:38.220> what<00:05:39.210> will<00:05:39.390> be

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
a lot of on floating around what will be

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.350 
a lot of on floating around what will be
used<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.990> lot<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.650> know<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:41.190> very<00:05:41.820> much<00:05:42.000> will

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
used a lot you know it very much will

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.090 
used a lot you know it very much will
punish<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.840> lot<00:05:43.140> of<00:05:43.200> players<00:05:43.410> who<00:05:43.620> will<00:05:43.740> just<00:05:43.950> go

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
punish a lot of players who will just go

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.400 
punish a lot of players who will just go
for<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.430> first<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.240> MST<00:05:45.660> against<00:05:46.170> your

for that first and MST against your

for that first and MST against your
stuff<00:05:47.480> because<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:49.610> feel<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:50.640> it's<00:05:51.450> nice<00:05:51.660> as<00:05:52.170> I

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
stuff because I feel that it's nice as I

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.710 
stuff because I feel that it's nice as I
mentioned<00:05:52.470> in<00:05:53.010> module<00:05:53.280> of<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.490> day<00:05:53.640> video<00:05:53.820> it's

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
mentioned in module of a day video it's

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.590 
mentioned in module of a day video it's
really<00:05:55.110> nice<00:05:55.410> to<00:05:55.470> see<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:56.480> sort<00:05:57.480> of<00:05:57.510> an

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
really nice to see a sort of an

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.620 
really nice to see a sort of an
archetype<00:05:58.050> which<00:05:58.860> has<00:05:59.160> changed<00:05:59.730> how<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.420> game

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
archetype which has changed how the game

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.690 
archetype which has changed how the game
is<00:06:00.900> because<00:06:01.560> it<00:06:01.650> actually<00:06:01.890> think<00:06:02.430> that<00:06:02.490> this

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
is because it actually think that this

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.510 
is because it actually think that this
is<00:06:02.760> one<00:06:03.060> of<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.210> most<00:06:03.270> groundbreaking<00:06:04.520> sort

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
is one of the most groundbreaking sort

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.440 
is one of the most groundbreaking sort
of<00:06:05.640> archetypes<00:06:06.330> for<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:07.230> long<00:06:07.680> while<00:06:08.450> I'm

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
of archetypes for a long while I'm

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.030 
of archetypes for a long while I'm
actually<00:06:09.630> thinking<00:06:09.990> back<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.410> what<00:06:10.800> might

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
actually thinking back to what might

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.310 
actually thinking back to what might
solve<00:06:12.740> equal<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:13.920> and<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:15.180> struggled<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.230> come

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
solve equal it and I struggled to come
