00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hi girls today but rai talk about 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.380
 all the products you fake 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 lately its own product and that it has 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
 this is the makeup remover of the oreal e 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 this is the biphasic makeup remover now i'm 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 finishing another the make-up remover always 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 more physical and then definitely buy again 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 this product that is or rather it 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 I will buy for the first time why 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 this was sent to me then on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 next I will buy you understand 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.199
 however the next one confirms it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 certainly because I liked it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 really a lot and me and you usually 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.330
 use and the biphasic make-up remover 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 only for the eyes while for the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 face and lips I use water 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 alternate the second product it has 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 finished this cocoa butter and this e 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 of the Provencals and I've heard of them 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 very good in so many videos so I have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.840
 decided to try it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 and actually a very product 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 very moisturizing to the other to winter 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.829
 because it really hydrates a lot 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 lips for the summer is a little bit 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.340
 heavily oily and similar 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 summer melts though if you look for a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 good cocoa butter for the winter 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.949
 surely this is for you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.719
 so I took the supermarket 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 I think you find it in the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.750
 supermarket where there are all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 Provencal products 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.960
 after that I also finished this mascara 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 and this is the new benefit mascara 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.670
 from yuri to the fact that it volumizes bellicini 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 to the students and especially the folds 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 verslype and the type of brush you like 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 you reminded me of those pipe cleaners 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.220
 plasticized silicone I imagine that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 so they don't have all the bristles 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.090
 various bristles but they are beautiful compact 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 that's what the disk type is I want that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 I prefer because I find it makes it to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 maximum on mine then gives us when 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 I have to buy a mascara generally 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.689
 I look at the pipe cleaner and let me know if 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 you look at other things too, though 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.500
 I do not think it changes much and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.600
 mascara formulation as much as the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.689
 shape of the brush after which I have 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 finished a product that I use from 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.149
 always from when memory however of which 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 we never talked about why 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.939
 I don't know because it never happens to me 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 to talk to you about toothpastes and things 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 such 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.960
 anyway I finished another jar of 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.329
 mouthwash and I really define it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 lots of a jar that will suffice a 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.399
 couple of months and this is really mine 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.500
 absolute master product 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 i can be without anything ie 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.180
 I finish any 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.920
 where can I go more than balin and mom 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.330
 steal the rocks steal him take it in 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 loan I can do without it 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.560
 if I finish the mouthwash added ie 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.360
 I have to run to the supermarket to take it 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 another because I do n't know how to be without the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.260
 morning after I brushed my teeth 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 I like to use mouthwash and not 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.410
 I know it makes you feel right for the whole 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.090
 day by ways I've finished too 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.620
 these two bubble bath and to say the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.019
 truth to follow if there is still one 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.400
 droplet we say that they are almost finished 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.989
 Tomorrow morning I will make the shower is 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.260
 surely there until those are now 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.850
 finished and these are both oily 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.370
 what I like about these bubble baths and 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.410
 of all skim bathrooms that are Liosi 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.299
 and that they really manage to leave mine 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.410
 skin hydrated skin and I like it you are 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.209
 been that in winter 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.430
 I explain myself in the winter of my legs 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.380
 always very dry so he needs to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.730
 something a little more moisturizing than one 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.080
 simple cream so I like it 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.480
 use a bubble bath of this 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.220
 kind so already exiting the shower can 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.959
 of the tub already the skin hydrated skin 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.989
 and soft and then just add the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.730
 cream and I'm alright you're in 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.260
 I need less hydration 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.220
 it is however to use these two 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.940
 products because I am a person 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.040
 basically lazy and so it was 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.500
 this I never want to apply the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 moisturizer especially in summer 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.650
 when it is very hot like this period 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.810
 no, I hate moisturizers 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.730
 summer because ok maybe the seo e 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.680
 when little more fresh roll I admit 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.010
 but by day the thought of leaving the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.650
 morning with sticky 30 degrees of 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 no cream really 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.739
 finally, the last product I would like 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.650
 let you see it is not finished it is 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.660
 practically committed suicide for the new 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.400
 snow foundation and that's what 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.079
 used in my anti ata makeup 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.870
 what he uses every day 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.850
 and this last week 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.480
 I practically took it to roll it out 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.370
 on the face my land and has been destroyed e 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.660
 went to pieces or even published 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.200
 a photograph resemble st gr1 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.200
 very sorry and so here it is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.800
 finished so many languages told me to 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.020
 get back together 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.110
 using alcohol and then save it 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.239
 but I'm afraid that after drinking alcohol 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.870
 my skin or anyway afraid it can 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.610
 go to do not know if to change the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.830
 composition of this foundation because 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.390
 it is completely natural and therefore seen 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.730
 that most had fallen for me 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.070
 earth and there was very little left 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.770
 in here he decided to leave it like this 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.660
 luckily gambre gave me his 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.430
 because a coloring she had is 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.530
 which therefore did not use mine again 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.210
 favorite foundation so nothing not 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.150
 I know if she's dancing as a finished product 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.560
 objectively discouraged, however, no obligation 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.850
 it is a finished product 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.710
 so nothing this was all mine 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.120
 finished products the last period let me 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.190
 to know if you too have finished some 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.390
 product and let me know if there is something 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.520
 that you finished that you liked 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.960
 especially and you will buy cary is 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.280
 I just didn't tell him if I will buy again 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.110
 these products the mouthwash 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.390
 surely yes because he can live 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.210
 without I already bought back the products i 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.430
 two baths also write butter 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.880
 of cocoa not now but going towards 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.410
 October November and mascara instead 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.510
 I think of struggles that I like to change 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.370
 always mascara and always try moscara 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.130
 new for or at least a moment brand e 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.200
 yes when will definitely yes 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.250
 tried to be two others so not 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.320
 will end soon 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.940
 and nothing I refer to super mega patches e 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.940
 we come next video bye
