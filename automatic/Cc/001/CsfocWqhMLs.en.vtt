in<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.750> middle<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.680> should<00:00:50.610> say

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
in the middle of that I should say

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
in the middle of that I should say
underneath<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.710> kick

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
pattern which is this so that was the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.369 
pattern which is this so that was the
kick<00:01:02.039> pattern<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> intro<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.199> down

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
with the sickness now if I put the parts

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
with the sickness now if I put the parts
together<00:01:06.950> again<00:01:07.950> I'll<00:01:08.070> slow<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.490> for

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
together again I'll slow it down for

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
together again I'll slow it down for
everybody<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> would<00:01:11.220> sound

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
everybody this is what it would sound

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:22.740 
everybody this is what it would sound
like

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.840 

here's<00:01:23.750> real-time<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.010> hopefully<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.790> will

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
here's real-time so hopefully that will

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:45.010 
here's real-time so hopefully that will
help<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.180> out<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:44.390> was<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.600> correct

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
help you out and that was the correct

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
way of doing the intro for down with the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.450 
way of doing the intro for down with the
sickness<00:01:47.840> now<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.979> maybe<00:01:49.190> have<00:01:49.430> a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
sickness now that you maybe have a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.640 
sickness now that you maybe have a
better<00:01:49.729> idea<00:01:49.940> how<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.690> goes<00:01:50.870> maybe<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.470> can

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
better idea how it goes maybe you can

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.650 
better idea how it goes maybe you can
improve<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.160> bit<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:52.790> can<00:01:52.910> see<00:01:53.150> your
