00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
system so I can actually switch on and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.899 
system so I can actually switch on and
off<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:43.269> headlights<00:03:44.470> as<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.590> can<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:46.780> here

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.720 

kind<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.049> neat<00:04:02.200> concept<00:04:02.670> don't<00:04:03.670> know

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
kind of a neat concept don't know

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.429 
kind of a neat concept don't know
whether<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:04.450> very<00:04:04.659> useful<00:04:05.079> but<00:04:05.459> yep

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:39.899 

so<00:04:11.439> let's<00:04:11.769> start<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.129> up

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:54.100 

of<00:04:40.179> course

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.289 

no<00:04:55.110> bad
