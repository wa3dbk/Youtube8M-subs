the<00:00:02.639> planters<00:00:03.090> plant<00:00:03.629> foot<00:00:03.810> hi<00:00:04.350> I'm<00:00:04.650> Ryan<00:00:04.980> Lee

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
the planters plant foot hi I'm Ryan Lee

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.579 
the planters plant foot hi I'm Ryan Lee
from<00:00:05.609> Indiana<00:00:06.120> University<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.020> today<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.410> have

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
from Indiana University and today I have

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.440 
from Indiana University and today I have
a<00:00:07.680> gardening<00:00:08.040> tip<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.580> calculating

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
a gardening tip about calculating

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.680 
a gardening tip about calculating
fertilizer<00:00:10.019> rates<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> container<00:00:12.480> of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
fertilizer rates so on a container of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.870 
fertilizer rates so on a container of
fertilizer<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.650> will<00:00:13.799> typically<00:00:14.099> find<00:00:14.219> three

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
fertilizer you will typically find three

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.760 
fertilizer you will typically find three
numbers<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.990> I'm<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> draw<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.500> an

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
numbers so I'm going to draw up an

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.490 
numbers so I'm going to draw up an
example<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.520> twelve<00:00:18.740> twelve<00:00:19.740> twelve<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
example here twelve twelve twelve so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.109 
example here twelve twelve twelve so
those<00:00:22.680> numbers<00:00:22.859> represent<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> percentage

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
those numbers represent the percentage

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
those numbers represent the percentage
of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> total<00:00:25.109> amount<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.800> fertilizer

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
of the total amount of that fertilizer

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.189 
of the total amount of that fertilizer
that<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.769> nitrogen<00:00:29.929> phosphorus<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that is nitrogen phosphorus and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.299 
that is nitrogen phosphorus and
potassium<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> example<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
potassium so in this example if we had a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
potassium so in this example if we had a
twelve<00:00:35.820> twelve<00:00:36.120> twelve<00:00:36.210> fertilizer<00:00:36.960> twelve

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
twelve twelve twelve fertilizer twelve

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.490 
twelve twelve twelve fertilizer twelve
percent<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> bag<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.059> actually<00:00:39.500> nitrogen

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
percent of that bag is actually nitrogen

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
percent of that bag is actually nitrogen
twelve<00:00:40.890> percent<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.399> phosphorus<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.120> twelve

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
twelve percent is phosphorus and twelve

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
twelve percent is phosphorus and twelve
percent<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> potassium<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
percent is potassium so if we want to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
percent is potassium so if we want to
calculate<00:00:45.600> how<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.620> fertilizer<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.640> need<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
calculate how much fertilizer we need to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.529 
calculate how much fertilizer we need to
use<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.690> particular<00:00:49.590> circumstance<00:00:50.539> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
use for particular circumstance that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.420 
use for particular circumstance that
depends<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> things<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:54.420> depends<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
depends on a lot of things it depends on

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
depends on a lot of things it depends on
the<00:00:56.430> soil<00:00:56.699> test<00:00:57.320> also<00:00:58.320> depends<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> plants

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the soil test also depends on the plants

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
the soil test also depends on the plants
that<00:00:59.550> you're<00:00:59.699> growing<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:01.170> good<00:01:01.620> example<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that you're growing so a good example is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.580 
that you're growing so a good example is
around<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.260> apply<00:01:04.820> one<00:01:05.820> pound

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
around here we like to apply one pound

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:18.850 
around here we like to apply one pound
of<00:01:08.360> nitrogen<00:01:10.939> per<00:01:14.180> 1,000<00:01:15.180> square<00:01:17.180> feet<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of
turf<00:01:19.860> grass<00:01:20.189> our<00:01:20.610> lawn<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.479> apply<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
turf grass our lawn we apply this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.249 
turf grass our lawn we apply this
nitrogen<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> fall<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:24.990> much

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
nitrogen in the fall so how much

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.929 
nitrogen in the fall so how much
fertilizer<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> put<00:01:26.850> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
fertilizer do we actually have to put on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.160 
fertilizer do we actually have to put on
our<00:01:27.090> yard<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:28.710> answer<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.790> say<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.869> if

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
our yard to answer that we say well if

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.800 
our yard to answer that we say well if
we've<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.619> our<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.880> let's<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we've got our so let's let's do a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
we've got our so let's let's do a
different<00:01:34.049> example<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
different example here we're going to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.350 
different example here we're going to
use<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.150> twenty<00:01:36.900> twenty<00:01:37.500> twenty<00:01:37.740> fertilizer<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
use a twenty twenty twenty fertilizer so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.179 
use a twenty twenty twenty fertilizer so
how<00:01:39.540> much<00:01:39.689> twenty<00:01:40.110> twenty<00:01:40.409> twenty<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> need

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
how much twenty twenty twenty do we need

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
how much twenty twenty twenty do we need
to<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.909> our<00:01:41.939> yard<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:43.020> equal<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.560> pound<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to put on our yard to equal one pound of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.850 
to put on our yard to equal one pound of
nitrogen<00:01:44.130> per<00:01:44.490> thousand<00:01:45.299> square<00:01:45.540> feet<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
nitrogen per thousand square feet so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.190 
nitrogen per thousand square feet so
that<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:48.439> one<00:01:50.030> per<00:01:51.030> thousand<00:01:52.020> square

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that would be one per thousand square

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.270 
that would be one per thousand square
feet<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.950> turf<00:01:53.820> grass

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
feet of turf grass

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.520 
feet of turf grass
then<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.430> know<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:58.650> for<00:01:59.650> every<00:01:59.800> 1<00:02:00.340> pound<00:02:00.730> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
then we know that for every 1 pound of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.940 
then we know that for every 1 pound of
fertilizer<00:02:04.650> there<00:02:05.650> is<00:02:06.630> 0.2<00:02:07.770> pounds<00:02:08.770> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
fertilizer there is 0.2 pounds of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
fertilizer there is 0.2 pounds of
nitrogen<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.620> if<00:02:11.620> we<00:02:11.770> multiply<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.400> across

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
nitrogen so if we multiply that across

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.370 
nitrogen so if we multiply that across
that<00:02:14.140> gives<00:02:14.500> us<00:02:14.800> 5<00:02:16.020> pounds<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.800> fertilizer<00:02:19.380> per

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
that gives us 5 pounds of fertilizer per

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.450 
that gives us 5 pounds of fertilizer per
thousand<00:02:20.980> square<00:02:21.280> feet<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> take-home

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
thousand square feet so the take-home

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.760 
thousand square feet so the take-home
point<00:02:27.940> about<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.930> actually<00:02:29.200> very

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
point about this is it's actually very

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.010 
point about this is it's actually very
little<00:02:30.250> fertilizer<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:31.150> we're<00:02:31.510> placing<00:02:31.750> on

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
little fertilizer that we're placing on

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.810 
little fertilizer that we're placing on
our<00:02:32.170> yard<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.920> want<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.340> about<00:02:33.640> this

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
our yard so you want to think about this

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.330 
our yard so you want to think about this
in<00:02:34.060> terms<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.630> five<00:02:35.020> pound<00:02:35.380> bag<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.860> sugar

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
in terms of a five pound bag of sugar

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.580 
in terms of a five pound bag of sugar
spread<00:02:37.090> across<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.510> thousand<00:02:38.080> square<00:02:38.260> feet

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
spread across a thousand square feet

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.940 
spread across a thousand square feet
it's<00:02:39.100> not<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.760> lot<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.390> fertilizer<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.740> is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it's not a lot of fertilizer and that is

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's not a lot of fertilizer and that is
going<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.490> be<00:02:42.610> important<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.110> really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
going to be important so to really

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.470 
going to be important so to really
demonstrate<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.670> thought<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.090> was<00:02:46.240> good

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
demonstrate that I thought it was good

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360 
demonstrate that I thought it was good
it<00:02:46.720> would<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.959> good<00:02:47.140> if<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.320> actually<00:02:47.590> actually

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it would be good if we actually actually

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670 
it would be good if we actually actually
showed<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.850> how<00:02:49.060> much<00:02:49.270> fertilizer<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:50.200> put<00:02:50.470> in

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
showed you how much fertilizer to put in

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.350 
showed you how much fertilizer to put in
a<00:02:51.100> small<00:02:51.459> pot<00:02:52.830> small<00:02:53.830> container<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:55.209> when<00:02:55.330> I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
a small pot small container so when I

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.699 
a small pot small container so when I
race<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.110> do<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.350> more<00:02:56.380> calculation

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
race this and do one more calculation

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
race this and do one more calculation
here<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.990> do<00:02:59.230> that<00:03:00.300> we're<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> use

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
here so to do that we're going to use

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.570 
here so to do that we're going to use
Osmocote<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.630> on<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> side<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.650> our<00:03:06.100> ausma

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
Osmocote and on the side of our ausma

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.240 
Osmocote and on the side of our ausma
coat<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.269> actually<00:03:07.630> tells<00:03:07.930> us<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.650> percentage

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
coat it actually tells us the percentage

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.280 
coat it actually tells us the percentage
of<00:03:10.320> NPK<00:03:11.320> by<00:03:12.100> weight<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.820> Osmocote<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.930> it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
of NPK by weight in Osmocote and it

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.540 
of NPK by weight in Osmocote and it
turns<00:03:14.500> out<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.680> be<00:03:14.800> 19<00:03:15.780> 6:12<00:03:17.220> write<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.400> up

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
turns out to be 19 6:12 write that up

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.170 
turns out to be 19 6:12 write that up
here<00:03:18.580> R<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:20.140> we<00:03:20.890> were<00:03:21.100> wanting<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
here R so if we were wanting to

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.920 
here R so if we were wanting to
fertilize<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:23.110> small<00:03:24.100> pot<00:03:24.430> let's<00:03:24.790> say<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.299> six

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
fertilize a small pot let's say a six

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.610 
fertilize a small pot let's say a six
inch<00:03:26.230> square<00:03:26.530> pot<00:03:30.330> how<00:03:31.330> much<00:03:31.540> Osmocote<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.530> we

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
inch square pot how much Osmocote do we

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.030 
inch square pot how much Osmocote do we
need<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.920> put<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.700> square<00:03:34.150> pot<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
need to put in that square pot so the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.370 
need to put in that square pot so the
first<00:03:36.250> thing<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:36.610> need<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:37.380> to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
first thing that we need to do to

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.750 
first thing that we need to do to
determine<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.989> how<00:03:40.989> many<00:03:41.200> acres<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.459> six

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
determine is how many acres is in a six

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.080 
determine is how many acres is in a six
inch<00:03:43.000> square<00:03:43.120> pot<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.239> equal<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:49.410> 0.25

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
inch square pot so this is equal to 0.25

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.730 
inch square pot so this is equal to 0.25
square<00:03:52.090> feet

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
square feet

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.040 
square feet
and<00:03:54.830> there's<00:03:55.580> four<00:03:57.370> 43,560<00:03:58.370> square<00:03:58.580> feet<00:03:59.570> per

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
and there's four 43,560 square feet per

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.440 
and there's four 43,560 square feet per
acre<00:04:00.350> which<00:04:01.040> means<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.460> we<00:04:01.550> have<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> very

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
acre which means that we have a very

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.680 
acre which means that we have a very
small<00:04:02.990> amount<00:04:03.800> amount<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.610> acres<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:05.510> have

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
small amount amount of acres we have

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.100 
small amount amount of acres we have
weight<00:04:05.960> with<00:04:06.200> zero<00:04:06.760> zero<00:04:07.760> zero<00:04:08.290> zero<00:04:09.490> zero

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
weight with zero zero zero zero zero

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.670 
weight with zero zero zero zero zero
five<00:04:12.760> acres<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:14.330> fertilize<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:15.140> this<00:04:15.290> example

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
five acres to fertilize in this example

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.140 
five acres to fertilize in this example
right<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:18.739> total<00:04:18.950> number<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.310> acreage<00:04:19.940> in

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
right so the total number of acreage in

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.640 
right so the total number of acreage in
our<00:04:20.270> pot<00:04:20.510> is<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:24.050> total<00:04:24.230> number<00:04:24.620> of

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
our pot is this the total number of

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310 
our pot is this the total number of
pounds<00:04:25.100> per<00:04:25.670> acre<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:26.180> nitrogen<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.050> we<00:04:27.140> want

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
pounds per acre of nitrogen that we want

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.130 
pounds per acre of nitrogen that we want
to<00:04:27.410> get<00:04:27.590> in<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.860> pot<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.430> 50<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:29.960> we

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
to get in that pot is 50 so if we

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.550 
to get in that pot is 50 so if we
multiply<00:04:30.320> our<00:04:31.070> acreage<00:04:31.730> by<00:04:32.210> 50<00:04:32.780> then<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.380> end

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
multiply our acreage by 50 then we end

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.840 
multiply our acreage by 50 then we end
up<00:04:33.740> with<00:04:33.950> Oh<00:04:33.980> point<00:04:34.250> zero<00:04:34.840> zero<00:04:35.840> zero<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:37.430> five

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
this is a few things one if you put too

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.430 
this is a few things one if you put too
much<00:05:24.620> fertilizer<00:05:25.130> on<00:05:25.820> your<00:05:26.420> plant<00:05:26.720> then<00:05:27.020> you

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
much fertilizer on your plant then you

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.560 
much fertilizer on your plant then you
will<00:05:27.790> cause<00:05:28.790> it<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:30.430> grow<00:05:31.430> leaves<00:05:31.850> instead<00:05:32.450> of

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
will cause it to grow leaves instead of

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.360 
will cause it to grow leaves instead of
flowers<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.320> fruits<00:05:33.650> it<00:05:33.860> will<00:05:33.980> do<00:05:34.130> things

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
flowers and fruits it will do things

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.490 
flowers and fruits it will do things
that<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.760> don't<00:05:34.970> want<00:05:35.300> it<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.570> do

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
that you don't want it to do

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.010 
that you don't want it to do
you'll<00:05:37.160> get<00:05:37.370> fewer<00:05:38.120> tomatoes<00:05:38.600> you'll<00:05:38.900> get

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
you'll get fewer tomatoes you'll get

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.930 
you'll get fewer tomatoes you'll get
fewer<00:05:39.380> petunias<00:05:40.190> you'll<00:05:40.520> get<00:05:40.670> a<00:05:40.700> lot<00:05:40.910> more

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
fewer petunias you'll get a lot more

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.090 
fewer petunias you'll get a lot more
leaves<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.870> lot<00:05:42.050> more<00:05:42.080> stem<00:05:42.470> tissue<00:05:42.800> in

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
leaves and a lot more stem tissue in

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.920 
leaves and a lot more stem tissue in
response<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:45.860> is<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:46.520> dry<00:05:46.910> fertilizers<00:05:47.630> act

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
response to is that dry fertilizers act

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.000 
response to is that dry fertilizers act
like<00:05:48.230> salts<00:05:48.800> they<00:05:49.160> tend<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:50.170> dehydrate<00:05:51.170> plant

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
like salts they tend to dehydrate plant

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.570 
like salts they tend to dehydrate plant

end up in tool art and law

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.030 
end up in tool art and law
arge<00:06:06.910> bodies<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.450> water<00:06:07.600> like<00:06:07.900> rivers<00:06:08.380> streams

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
arge bodies of water like rivers streams

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.430 
arge bodies of water like rivers streams
and<00:06:09.370> lakes<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:10.030> oceans<00:06:10.180> and<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.050> will<00:06:11.170> cause

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
and lakes and oceans and it will cause

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.710 
and lakes and oceans and it will cause
things<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:12.070> grow<00:06:12.310> that<00:06:12.610> you<00:06:12.730> do<00:06:13.030> not<00:06:13.240> want<00:06:13.570> to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
things to grow that you do not want to

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.080 
things to grow that you do not want to
grow<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.410> will<00:06:14.530> cause<00:06:14.710> algal<00:06:15.070> blooms<00:06:15.520> or<00:06:16.000> it

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
grow it will cause algal blooms or it

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.210 
grow it will cause algal blooms or it
will<00:06:16.180> cause<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.570> growth<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.810> bacteria<00:06:17.560> and

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
will cause the growth of bacteria and

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.420 
will cause the growth of bacteria and
these<00:06:18.760> things<00:06:19.030> cause<00:06:19.300> fish<00:06:19.690> kills<00:06:20.020> so<00:06:20.740> if<00:06:21.100> we

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
these things cause fish kills so if we

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.670 
these things cause fish kills so if we
want<00:06:21.760> to<00:06:21.820> have<00:06:22.030> fertilizer<00:06:22.500> available<00:06:23.500> for

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
want to have fertilizer available for

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.350 
want to have fertilizer available for
home<00:06:24.070> use<00:06:24.340> in<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.580> future<00:06:24.730> then<00:06:25.030> we<00:06:25.120> have<00:06:25.270> to

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
home use in the future then we have to

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.510 
home use in the future then we have to
be<00:06:25.480> very<00:06:25.810> careful<00:06:26.320> about<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.830> amount<00:06:26.890> that<00:06:27.310> we

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
be very careful about the amount that we

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.240 
be very careful about the amount that we
use<00:06:27.850> and<00:06:28.090> use<00:06:28.720> our<00:06:28.870> calculations<00:06:29.620> to

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
use and use our calculations to

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.340 
use and use our calculations to
determine<00:06:30.400> how<00:06:30.910> much<00:06:31.120> to<00:06:31.360> put<00:06:31.570> in<00:06:31.630> each

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
determine how much to put in each
