transition<00:00:37.530> Oh<00:00:38.960> probably<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:41.420> because<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
transition Oh probably just because I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.590 
transition Oh probably just because I
chose<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.550> transition<00:00:44.550> using<00:00:44.760> heat<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.360> not

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
chose to transition using heat I'm not

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
chose to transition using heat I'm not
saying<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.770> best<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
saying that this is the best way and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
saying that this is the best way and
that<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> only<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.140> clearly

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that it's the only way because clearly

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.459 
that it's the only way because clearly
it's<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.480> chose<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.320> do

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it's not it's just what I chose to do

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
it's not it's just what I chose to do
you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> remember<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.350> 2006

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you have to remember that in 2006

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.660 
you have to remember that in 2006
through<00:00:56.239> probably<00:00:57.239> 2009<00:00:58.020> summer<00:00:58.530> 2010<00:00:59.370> there

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
through probably 2009 summer 2010 there

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.029 
through probably 2009 summer 2010 there
was<00:00:59.850> absolutely<00:01:00.510> no<00:01:00.960> information<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.829> there

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
was absolutely no information out there

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
was absolutely no information out there
on<00:01:02.219> natural<00:01:02.579> hair<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:03.090> clue<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.570> doing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on natural hair no clue what I was doing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.039 
on natural hair no clue what I was doing
I<00:01:04.320> guess<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> why<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> chose<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I guess that is why I chose to do what I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.770 
I guess that is why I chose to do what I
did<00:01:07.260> because<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.710> didn't<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.220> any<00:01:08.369> better<00:01:08.460> so

years I put heat in my hair every three
weeks<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.770> know<00:05:35.100> it's<00:05:35.610> insane<00:05:35.850> but<00:05:36.450> it's<00:05:36.570> what<00:05:36.810> I

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
weeks I know it's insane but it's what I

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.580 
weeks I know it's insane but it's what I
did<00:05:37.170> I'm<00:05:37.410> currently<00:05:38.010> using<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.730> cheap<00:05:39.150> air

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
flatiron the one that I use the majority

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.510 
flatiron the one that I use the majority
of<00:05:42.630> my<00:05:42.780> transition<00:05:43.200> was<00:05:43.590> very<00:05:43.770> similar<00:05:44.340> to

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
of my transition was very similar to

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.460 
of my transition was very similar to
this<00:05:44.670> but<00:05:44.910> it<00:05:45.000> was<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.150> generic<00:05:45.780> version<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:46.320> I

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
this but it was the generic version I I

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.920 
this but it was the generic version I I
started<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.370> wean<00:05:47.610> myself<00:05:47.850> off<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.690> flat

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
started to wean myself off of the flat

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.960 
started to wean myself off of the flat
iron<00:05:49.170> and<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.560> did<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.920> once<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.340> month<00:05:50.550> than

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
iron and I did it once a month than

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.850 
iron and I did it once a month than
every<00:05:51.570> other<00:05:51.750> month<00:05:52.110> than<00:05:52.440> every<00:05:52.830> three

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
every other month than every three

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.520 
every other month than every three
months<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.700> now<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.270> ultimately<00:05:55.020> only<00:05:55.380> put

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
months and now I ultimately only put

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.800 
months and now I ultimately only put
heat<00:05:55.710> in<00:05:55.830> my<00:05:55.920> hair<00:05:56.130> four<00:05:56.550> times<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:57.150> year<00:05:57.210> one

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
heat in my hair four times a year one

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
my straight hair as well but I saw a

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.510 
my straight hair as well but I saw a
huge<00:06:03.000> dramatic<00:06:03.300> change<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.800> health<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.280> my

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
hair the thickness of my hair and my

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.040 
hair the thickness of my hair and my
hair<00:06:08.580> just<00:06:08.820> started<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.360> grow<00:06:09.690> like<00:06:09.990> crazy

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
hair just started to grow like crazy

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.240 
hair just started to grow like crazy
once<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:11.040> stopped<00:06:11.490> doing<00:06:11.850> all<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.390> heat

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
once I stopped doing all the heat

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.040 
once I stopped doing all the heat
trimming<00:06:14.250> those<00:06:14.490> split<00:06:15.030> ends<00:06:15.480> so<00:06:15.630> I<00:06:15.660> am<00:06:15.990> a

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
trimming those split ends so I am a

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.960 
trimming those split ends so I am a
person<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.440> is<00:06:16.620> more<00:06:16.830> prone<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.190> split<00:06:17.700> ends

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
person that is more prone to split ends

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.330 
person that is more prone to split ends
so<00:06:18.150> I<00:06:18.420> have<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.260> pay<00:06:19.380> a<00:06:19.410> little<00:06:19.710> bit<00:06:19.920> more<00:06:20.100> close

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
so I have to pay a little bit more close

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.130 
so I have to pay a little bit more close
attention<00:06:20.640> to<00:06:20.850> them<00:06:21.090> but<00:06:21.510> every<00:06:21.750> three<00:06:22.020> to

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
attention to them but every three to

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.960 
attention to them but every three to
four<00:06:22.290> months<00:06:22.350> during<00:06:22.920> my<00:06:23.010> transition<00:06:23.250> the

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
four months during my transition the

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.640 
four months during my transition the
whole<00:06:24.240> time<00:06:24.480> I<00:06:24.510> would<00:06:24.930> go<00:06:25.110> into<00:06:25.380> a

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
whole time I would go into a

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.070 
whole time I would go into a
professional<00:06:26.460> and<00:06:26.640> get<00:06:26.790> my<00:06:26.940> ends<00:06:27.150> trimmed<00:06:27.510> but

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
professional and get my ends trimmed but

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.650 
professional and get my ends trimmed but
in<00:06:28.200> between<00:06:28.620> those<00:06:29.310> months<00:06:29.850> I<00:06:29.940> have<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.330> few

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
in between those months I have a few

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.570 
in between those months I have a few
techniques<00:06:31.080> where<00:06:31.320> I<00:06:31.350> would<00:06:31.590> make<00:06:31.830> sure<00:06:32.010> to

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
techniques where I would make sure to

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.910 
techniques where I would make sure to
maintain<00:06:33.030> those<00:06:33.270> ends<00:06:33.750> when<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:34.380> comes<00:06:34.680> to

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
maintain those ends when it comes to

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.270 
maintain those ends when it comes to
