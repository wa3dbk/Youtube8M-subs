00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
for all these years was was fascinating

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
for all these years was was fascinating
I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:59.040> ours<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> coolest<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.000> bunch

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I think ours is the coolest in the bunch

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
I think ours is the coolest in the bunch
but<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.930> personal<00:02:01.229> opinion<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.160> kinda

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but that's a personal opinion it's kinda

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
but that's a personal opinion it's kinda
like<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.460> bomb<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.970> guess<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.619> were

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like a bomb I guess and then as we were

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.920 
like a bomb I guess and then as we were
coming<00:02:04.830> down<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> river<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.700> saw<00:02:05.910> all<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.929 

and<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.959> although<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:01.159> name<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.519> ships<00:03:01.760> is

a Russian spy ship floating down the
river<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.769> must've<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.489> provoked<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.939> lot<00:03:14.120> of

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
river it must've have provoked a lot of

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.819 
river it must've have provoked a lot of
questions<00:03:14.629> it<00:03:14.810> was<00:03:14.930> kind<00:03:15.139> of<00:03:15.200> interesting<00:03:15.379> to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
questions it was kind of interesting to

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.920 
questions it was kind of interesting to
see<00:03:16.010> people<00:03:17.000> getting<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.450> their<00:03:17.569> cars<00:03:17.599> and

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
looking at it and I'm sure there was a

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.099 
looking at it and I'm sure there was a
lot<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> head-scratching<00:03:20.030> going<00:03:20.719> on<00:03:20.840> as<00:03:20.989> she

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
lot of head-scratching going on as she

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.830 
lot of head-scratching going on as she
went<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.489> but<00:03:22.489> sure<00:03:22.790> enough<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:23.269> made<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.659> under

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
went by but sure enough it made it under

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.869 
went by but sure enough it made it under
the<00:03:23.930> bridge<00:03:24.169> and<00:03:24.620> then<00:03:24.889> we<00:03:25.099> had<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.310> further<00:03:25.669> on

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
the bridge and then we had to further on

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.330 
the bridge and then we had to further on
down<00:03:25.909> the<00:03:26.150> river<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.620> know<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.889> channel<00:03:28.280> of

down the river you know the channel of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.190 
down the river you know the channel of

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
huge piece of reef that's going to be

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.879 
huge piece of reef that's going to be
when<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.599> big<00:04:02.840> artifact<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.439> going<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.769> on

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
when a big artifact is going to be on

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.759 
when a big artifact is going to be on
the<00:04:04.009> bottom<00:04:04.159> so<00:04:04.849> we<00:04:04.970> start<00:04:05.180> going<00:04:05.449> by<00:04:05.720> just<00:04:06.620> on

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769

learned some lessons from the previous
projects<00:06:22.220> things<00:06:22.820> that<00:06:23.000> didn't<00:06:23.419> go<00:06:23.690> so<00:06:23.720> well

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930

things<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.620> went<00:06:24.950> a<00:06:25.010> lot<00:06:25.040> better<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.760> we've

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
things that went a lot better and we've

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.970 
things that went a lot better and we've
applied<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.870> to<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.200> Vandenberg<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:27.919> the

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
applied that to the Vandenberg in the

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.710 
applied that to the Vandenberg in the
Vandenberg<00:06:28.490> even<00:06:29.090> though<00:06:29.180> it's<00:06:29.300> taking<00:06:29.690> quite

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
Vandenberg even though it's taking quite

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.590 
Vandenberg even though it's taking quite
a<00:06:29.900> bit<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.200> time<00:06:30.610> we<00:06:31.610> feel<00:06:31.850> that<00:06:31.880> we<00:06:32.270> have<00:06:32.480> the

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
a bit of time we feel that we have the

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.500 
a bit of time we feel that we have the
process<00:06:33.080> down<00:06:33.320> now<00:06:33.790> we've<00:06:34.790> learned<00:06:35.090> that<00:06:35.270> you

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
process down now we've learned that you

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.510 
process down now we've learned that you
can't<00:06:35.780> do<00:06:36.200> it<00:06:36.350> with<00:06:36.380> volunteer<00:06:36.950> effort<00:06:37.280> alone

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
can't do it with volunteer effort alone

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.990 
can't do it with volunteer effort alone
it<00:06:38.510> helps<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.560> gets<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:39.980> project<00:06:40.430> going<00:06:40.640> and

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
it helps it gets the project going and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.270 
it helps it gets the project going and
they're<00:06:41.720> volunteers<00:06:42.290> are<00:06:42.530> great<00:06:42.800> but<00:06:43.130> you

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
they're volunteers are great but you

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.770 
they're volunteers are great but you
have<00:06:43.430> to<00:06:43.550> really<00:06:43.700> have<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.120> managed

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
have to really have it managed

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.350 
have to really have it managed
professionally<00:06:45.560> because<00:06:46.490> they're<00:06:46.880> just<00:06:47.060> so

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
professionally because they're just so

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.020 
professionally because they're just so
complex<00:06:47.810> to<00:06:48.050> such<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.260> complex<00:06:49.070> project<00:06:49.430> and

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
complex to such a complex project and

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.670 
complex to such a complex project and
then<00:06:50.210> that's<00:06:50.480> our<00:06:50.750> that's<00:06:50.990> one<00:06:51.530> of<00:06:51.620> the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
then that's our that's one of the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.730 
then that's our that's one of the
lessons<00:06:51.710> we<00:06:52.220> learned<00:06:52.460> to<00:06:53.210> do<00:06:53.690> it<00:06:53.840> right<00:06:54.050> it

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
lessons we learned to do it right it

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.340 
lessons we learned to do it right it
does<00:06:55.100> cost<00:06:55.400> more<00:06:55.730> money<00:06:55.790> but<00:06:56.300> that<00:06:56.510> was<00:06:56.750> to<00:06:57.169> do

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
does cost more money but that was to do

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.430 
does cost more money but that was to do
it<00:06:57.470> right<00:06:57.620> yet<00:06:57.890> you<00:06:58.070> have<00:06:58.280> to
