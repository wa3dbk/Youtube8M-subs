 with this new video for the channel and 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.120
 Here I bring you some curiosities 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 interesting or that have seemed to me 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.610
 very interesting with respect to gta 5 and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 with respect to the rockstar website 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 games and the truth is that I have arrived 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.470
 here out of curiosity because the truth is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm not at all curious and I suppose 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.910
 many of you too do not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 you will be so I have decided because good 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.880
 I'm going to tell the story and it's that I 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.859
 I was looking for information about last 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 they will change etcetera etcetera but 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.640
 Come on, it seems that Rosa does not have 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 secret of confession because I have not 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 got to find out anything from east of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.030
 this last patch but getting like this 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 that by the way take advantage of all 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.690
 clicks that you have on the channel because they're going 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.309
 to change over all the money what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 I mean for the money that many of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 you will be new to the channel and not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 You will have seen it so use it 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.899
 because they are going to change it very soon 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 soon good the case that looking for this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.870
 I managed to get into the page of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.309
 rockstar games I have not gotten 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 have I will put the link here below 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.480
 teach that seen very little things 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 Interesting 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.930
 on this page as I say the link what 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 you have down here and we're going to go to the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.730
 part of arts and downloads that we have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.980
 down here well in this section what 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.170
 let's find apart from the crowd 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.730
 of wallpapers that there are with the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.350
 the official wallpapers the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.630
 official drawings of grand theft auto 5 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.980
 that we can also download them in a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 bunch we just have to click on 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.640
 that you want, we stopped the mobile phone to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.020
 wallpaper or if you have a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 youtube channel to make your 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.730
 own thumbnails with using these 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.230
 funds well then apart from this and apart 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.270
 of the many avatars that we have here 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.100
 many avatars that there are also going to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.440
 go to what I think most 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 important part of this section and are the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.460
 applications for mobile right we're going to 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 start with this one that we have here this 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.400
 is a mobile application that is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 call 'the saints' right in these 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.210
 applications we can download them well 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.460
 from the app store or from the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.480
 google play well let's go there 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.709
 application has seemed very 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.180
 interesting is the application of the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.560
 custom jumps and with this application 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.870
 we can modify it 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.489
 vehicles all we want from 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.930
 our vehicles from anywhere 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.130
 we can already be loading in the bathroom 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.050
 we can be modifying our 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.670
 vehicle and best of all is that all 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.860
 these changes that we do well changes 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.780
 what power can we read here we can 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.970
 choose color tinted glass paint 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.099
 Smoke ruffle cloak spoilers 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.349
 engine improvements the brakes the exhaust 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.209
 suspension and add accessories like 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.519
 lights horn tires shield 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.989
 bulletproof in order all these changes that 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.900
 We can make from our mobile and 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.890
 from anywhere and also all 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.660
 these changes will be reflected 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.130
 then when we enter our 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.330
 video game when we have in our 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.880
 playstation all the changes that 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.860
 modified on the mobile will be saved in 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 our game but that's not the best thing what 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.250
 that I found most interesting about 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.780
 this application is that we can 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.940
 customize our license plates 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.860
 our own registrations with the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.440
 colors that we want even I think that 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.720
 we can put our name is worth in the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.250
 registration it seems very interesting to me to go 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 with my car and with my license plate that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.060
 have my name on the license plate let's go 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.400
 that in a cool neighborhood plan in plan 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.349
 more cool of the male a good city then 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.570
 good is apart from this application that 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.520
 I find it very interesting we have another 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.070
 application below that is the chop 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.660
 ok it's called the dog and well with this 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.150
 application is like having our own 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.520
 tamagotchi but it's not a tamagotchi is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.660
 our dog and well we can do 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.060
 with this application so very simple 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.530
 here we have the screenshots of 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.880
 is this application and what 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.370
 we can do with this application is 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.710
 take care of our dog take care of chop 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.030
 thing that will also be reflected such and 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.430
 how we take care of you will be reflected 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.590
 when we then get into franklin and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.540
 Let's play with the vale, let's play with chop 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.740
 with this application we can do 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.120
 because we will have to feed him 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.050
 We will have to take a walk 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.540
 we have to teach tricks to catch 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.700
 sticks to pull a stick and take it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.620
 etcetera etcetera and all this according to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.150
 happy or more dissatisfied is going to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.560
 see reflected in the game when 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.410
 we enter into our 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.520
 playstation and our game is worth me 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.650
 It has seemed like a pretty application 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.420
 funny pretty entertaining power 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.280
 control our dog from the mobile 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.870
 like the previous one that is of the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.100
 that of saints like me has also 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.810
 seemed like a pretty application 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.820
 interesting and pretty good about everything 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.049
 what of the license plates in what most 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.520
 that I liked what they can 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.230
 modify our license plates 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.630
 thing that in the video game we can not 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.250
 do it but best of all 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.510
 or what I've seen that seems to me most 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.810
 more interesting is what comes next 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.310
 which is the gta 5 the manual is worth a manual 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.020
 fully interactive that we 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.510
 we can download well for pc well 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.320
 for mac from the app store or for from 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.970
 google play and it's a manual that contains 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.530
 more than 100 pages covering all 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.930
 aspects as it says here from the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 Game controls functions up 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.320
 the tours of the different zones and 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.960
 activities that you can carry out in 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.700
 the saints are well worth the only thing that you have 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.290
 what to do to download this manual is 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.030
 totally free and here you have the 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.050
 link since I started if you are in the 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.480
 computer the only thing that you have to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.730
 click is started if you downloaded and what 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.340
 you will have to install once installed 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.930
 what we are going to do is go to the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.930
 application that is this that we have here 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.580
 and click on it is worth I've already 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.200
 open before so I'm not going to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.340
 megas ask and ask me what it goes for you 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.470
 to ask for the language and the only thing 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.480
 you have to give to that Spanish and 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.000
 platform then playstation3 those that 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.520
 PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 are what 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800
 be of xbox 360 and in my case in 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.690
 playstation3 and I'm going to lake and here 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.950
 we have how we would come out this is how 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.030
 we would leave on the mobile because it is a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.660
 application for the mobile and in the 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.580
 computer 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.500
 just as it would come out or we would have to 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.870
 get out on the mobile and the only thing we have 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.610
 what to do is to go touching and interacting 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.620
 with this application where we can 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.970
 see the controls where we can 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.780
 see the characteristics of the game 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.840
 player statistics we can see 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.940
 a welcome presentation to the saints 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.590
 customize car navigation and 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.360
 underwater exploration et cetera etcetera 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.310
 good is a very complete guide very 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.080
 complete and what I liked the most is 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.240
 be here the map of the saints in plan 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.670
 google maps totally because in addition 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.930
 we can move them and click on the 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.160
 right up and we can do 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.260
 zoom with him with the mouse to get closer 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.910
 or get away with the mouse 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.760
 You see here, you see, I'm getting closer, 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.140
 the whole city I'm going down and in the end it's 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.150
 I do not quite find it enough 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.010
 quite attractive not only for that but 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.690
 because it also shows you all 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.790
 all the activities that are 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.590
 found inside the map for example 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.030
 shopping stores here we have the 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.220
 public transport 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.630
 here we have police stations and if we are going to 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.460
 the little arrow explains a little bit 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.840
 all about the police stations and so on 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.270
 etcetera is worth all the missions that 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.190
 we can perform 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.900
 we have here local sponsors do not 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.070
 I know it's an application with a lot 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.680
 information about the game with 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.480
 totally free and we can see then 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.040
 here we have a little bit of gta online 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.780
 etcetera etcetera good I do not know about you 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.280
 you will have to investigate and you can continue 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.740
 looking at it but I did not like it 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.360
 quite interesting enough here 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.720
 we have even the careers that we can 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.069
 make careers 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.599
 activities etcetera etcetera good not 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.849
 I know if in the neighborhoods 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.919
 we can get the neighborhoods 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.539
 also what are all the neighborhoods called 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.400
 etc points of interest 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.750
 you can not know you can leave alone 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.819
 signaled what you like most or 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.220
 signaling all of you watching over there 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.720
 the gun stores and so on and so on and 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.849
 nothing seems to me I have not seen 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.440
 quite interesting to have it and how 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.470
 I say again many of you 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.090
 surely you did not know it because nothing here 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.860
 I teach it to you so I do not expect anything 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.520
 I liked the video if it's like that life 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.050
 favorites 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.470
 see you in the next a greeting and 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.470
 goodbye
