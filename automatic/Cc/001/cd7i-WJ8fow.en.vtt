00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
getting away from us so now let's say

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.870 
getting away from us so now let's say
that<00:02:26.040> your<00:02:26.160> alternate<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.519> down<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
situation so one thing I learned is that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.870 
situation so one thing I learned is that
you<00:02:28.980> shouldn't<00:02:29.220> team<00:02:29.400> fight<00:02:29.550> without<00:02:29.730> your

ultimate<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.660> movement<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.080> alternates

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
ultimate as a movement is alternates

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500

could<00:02:41.010> probably<00:02:41.160> want<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.880> yeah<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.269> just

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
could probably want so yeah you can just

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.120 
could probably want so yeah you can just
wait<00:02:42.630> out<00:02:42.780> not<00:02:43.019> get<00:02:43.200> caught<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:44.010> tear

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
wait out not get caught and just tear

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.410 
wait out not get caught and just tear
your<00:02:44.220> team<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.519> wait<00:02:44.670> until<00:02:44.819> your<00:02:45.030> ultimate<00:02:45.299> is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
your team to wait until your ultimate is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.759 
your team to wait until your ultimate is
up<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.720> they<00:02:46.049> say<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.200> moral<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> story

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
up and they say the moral of the story

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.650 
up and they say the moral of the story
is<00:02:47.069> don't<00:02:47.430> fight<00:02:47.819> any<00:02:48.030> team<00:02:48.269> fights<00:02:48.510> without

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
is don't fight any team fights without

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.449 
is don't fight any team fights without
your<00:02:48.959> ultimate<00:02:49.260> as<00:02:49.830> one<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> movies

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
your ultimate as one of the movies

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.370 
your ultimate as one of the movies
biggest<00:02:50.730> strength<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.510> hard<00:02:51.690> initiation

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
biggest strength this is hard initiation

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.110 
biggest strength this is hard initiation
onto<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> enemy<00:02:53.010> team<00:02:53.190> without<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.970> he's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
onto the enemy team without that he's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.030 
onto the enemy team without that he's
just<00:02:54.150> got<00:02:54.450> his<00:02:54.480> single<00:02:54.900> target<00:02:55.170> CC<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.680> his<00:02:55.799> Q

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
just got his single target CC with his Q

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.949 
just got his single target CC with his Q
so<00:02:56.549> amumu<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.120> teamfights<00:02:57.330> width<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
so amumu in teamfights width is the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.839 
so amumu in teamfights width is the
ultimate<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.470> time<00:02:58.709> his<00:02:59.190> goal<00:02:59.459> should<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
ultimate this time his goal should be to

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.370 
ultimate this time his goal should be to
hit<00:03:00.090> two<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.540> more<00:03:00.660> people<00:03:00.840> with<00:03:01.260> his

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
hit two or more people with his

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.289 
hit two or more people with his
alternate<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.370> his<00:03:02.489> team<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.849> focus<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
alternate so that his team can focus the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.910 
alternate so that his team can focus the
enemies<00:03:03.569> were<00:03:03.720> pinned<00:03:04.080> down<00:03:04.140> or<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.890> course

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
enemies were pinned down or of course

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.650 
enemies were pinned down or of course
don't<00:03:05.310> enemy<00:03:05.610> from<00:03:05.760> getting<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> his<00:03:06.299> carries

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
don't enemy from getting to his carries

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.720 
don't enemy from getting to his carries
in<00:03:07.019> most<00:03:07.290> situations<00:03:07.440> usually<00:03:07.890> peel<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
in most situations usually peel as a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.880 
in most situations usually peel as a
muumuu<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.630> situation<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.350> had<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.650> flash

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
muumuu in that situation I had to flash

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.530 
muumuu in that situation I had to flash
for<00:03:11.100> those<00:03:11.190> two<00:03:11.340> kills<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
for those two kills so this is a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.849 
for those two kills so this is a
teamfight<00:03:12.840> where<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.350> do<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.799> year

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
teamfight where we do get in this year

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.830 
teamfight where we do get in this year
on<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.700> course<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.120> get<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.299> pic<00:03:15.480> before

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
on but of course we do get a pic before

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.870 
on but of course we do get a pic before
we<00:03:16.049> do<00:03:16.320> get<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> shade<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
we do get in the shade it on so as you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.310 
we do get in the shade it on so as you
can<00:03:17.940> see<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> didn't<00:03:18.450> use<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.570> ultimate<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.200> on

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
can see I didn't use my ultimate just on

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.780 
can see I didn't use my ultimate just on
lissandra<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.130> knew<00:03:20.280> she<00:03:20.489> was<00:03:20.609> dead

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
lissandra because I knew she was dead

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.550 
lissandra because I knew she was dead
and<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.570> can<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:21.900> holding<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.470> my

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and as you can see I'm holding on to my

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.170 
and as you can see I'm holding on to my
ultimate<00:03:22.890> until<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.370> use<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.519> on<00:03:23.700> two<00:03:24.030> or

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
ultimate until I can use it on two or

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.479 
ultimate until I can use it on two or
more<00:03:24.299> people<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.989> peel<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.500> my<00:03:25.620> team<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.040> so

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
more people to peel for my team and so

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.740 
more people to peel for my team and so
they<00:03:26.579> can<00:03:26.730> switch<00:03:26.910> focus<00:03:27.150> at<00:03:27.420> those<00:03:27.540> two

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
they can switch focus at those two

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.840 
they can switch focus at those two
targets<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.680> again<00:03:28.980> let's<00:03:29.190> go<00:03:29.340> over<00:03:29.609> another

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
targets so again let's go over another

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.030 
targets so again let's go over another
team<00:03:30.090> fight<00:03:30.299> last<00:03:30.660> one<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.930> promise<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.859> in<00:03:31.920> this

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.710 
team fight last one I promise so in this
is<00:03:32.160> your<00:03:32.280> issue<00:03:32.400> nice<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> Varys<00:03:33.600> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
is your issue nice to see that Varys is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.479 
is your issue nice to see that Varys is
pretty<00:03:33.989> far<00:03:34.230> out<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.620> looks<00:03:35.160> like<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> pretty

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
pretty far out and looks like a pretty

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.490 
pretty far out and looks like a pretty
easy<00:03:35.730> target<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.120> use<00:03:36.329> my<00:03:36.480> QR<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.290> course<00:03:37.440> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
easy target to use my QR and of course a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.440 
easy target to use my QR and of course a
good<00:03:37.650> initiation<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.850> do<00:03:38.910> notice<00:03:39.239> I'm

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
good initiation and then I do notice I'm

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.030 
good initiation and then I do notice I'm
taking<00:03:39.660> too<00:03:39.780> much<00:03:39.900> damage<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.560> fall<00:03:40.859> back

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
taking too much damage so I do fall back

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.559 
taking too much damage so I do fall back
for<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> little<00:03:41.370> bit<00:03:41.549> then<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.970> see<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.450> we're

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
for a little bit then I see that we're

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.880 
for a little bit then I see that we're
winning<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> team<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> do<00:03:43.500> see<00:03:43.769> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
winning the team so I do see the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.620 
winning the team so I do see the
opportunity<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.430> jump<00:03:44.639> back<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.150> try<00:03:45.239> to

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
opportunity to jump back in and try to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.509 
opportunity to jump back in and try to
get<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.900> team<00:03:46.019> more<00:03:46.230> kills<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.100> tip<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.489> a

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
get the team more kills so tip with a

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.200 
get the team more kills so tip with a
moo<00:03:47.700> moo

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
moo moo

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.810 
moo moo
is<00:03:48.300> if<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.960> are<00:03:49.020> in<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.440> sticky<00:03:49.620> situation<00:03:49.820> try

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
is if you are in a sticky situation try

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.190 
is if you are in a sticky situation try
and<00:03:50.910> think<00:03:51.000> about<00:03:51.240> escape<00:03:51.570> routes<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> moo

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
and think about escape routes with a moo

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.050 
and think about escape routes with a moo
moo<00:03:52.230> as<00:03:52.470> your<00:03:52.770> queue<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> gap<00:03:53.580> closer<00:03:53.850> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
moo as your queue is a gap closer and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180
