modern warfare 2 has kind of one or two
distinct<00:00:42.329> differences<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.559> get

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
distinct differences one that will get

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
distinct differences one that will get
to<00:00:43.829> later<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> fact<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to later the other one is the fact that
