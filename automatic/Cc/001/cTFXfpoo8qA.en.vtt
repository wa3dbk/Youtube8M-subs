00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
Twitter since that's the easiest way to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.410 
Twitter since that's the easiest way to
contact<00:02:59.860> someone<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.459> since<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.269> have<00:03:01.359> a

contact someone and since I don't have a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
smartphone I couldn't respond I couldn't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.860 
smartphone I couldn't respond I couldn't
see<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.910> they<00:03:04.060> were<00:03:04.120> looking<00:03:04.299> for<00:03:04.690> me<00:03:04.840> I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
see that they were looking for me I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.430 
see that they were looking for me I
couldn't<00:03:05.200> find<00:03:06.190> out<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.549> information<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.900> it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
couldn't find out this information so it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.220 
couldn't find out this information so it
made<00:03:08.709> me<00:03:08.739> think<00:03:09.269> even<00:03:10.269> harder<00:03:10.630> about<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> fact

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
made me think even harder about the fact

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.870 
made me think even harder about the fact
that<00:03:11.410> having<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.799> smartphone<00:03:12.100> would<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.579> really

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
that having a smartphone would be really

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.720 
that having a smartphone would be really
nice<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:15.000> 2013<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.359> going<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> year

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
nice so 2013 is going to be the year

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.699 
nice so 2013 is going to be the year
2013<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> going<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.780> year<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.079> two

carrying the iPhone in just a few more

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.800 
carrying the iPhone in just a few more
days<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.190> actually<00:03:45.370> started<00:03:46.090> looking<00:03:46.569> at

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
days and I actually started looking at

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.530 
days and I actually started looking at
their<00:03:47.200> prices<00:03:47.739> how<00:03:47.950> much<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.250> would<00:03:48.370> cost<00:03:48.540> for

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
their prices how much it would cost for

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.910 
their prices how much it would cost for
me<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.720> get<00:03:50.019> an<00:03:50.140> iPhone<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.650> was<00:03:50.769> pretty

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
me to get an iPhone it was pretty

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.410 
me to get an iPhone it was pretty
expensive<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.730> was<00:03:51.850> like<00:03:52.000> well<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.269> know

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
expensive and I was like well you know

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.780 
expensive and I was like well you know
how<00:03:53.290> much<00:03:53.470> would<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.680> cost<00:03:53.769> at<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.430> point<00:03:54.880> to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
how much would it cost at that point to

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.390 
how much would it cost at that point to
add<00:03:55.909> mal<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:57.110> at<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.890> point<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.220> was<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
add mal and at that point it was the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.539 
add mal and at that point it was the
same<00:03:58.670> price<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.090> she's<00:03:59.599> paying<00:03:59.870> now<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.680> know

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
same price that she's paying now I know

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.039 
same price that she's paying now I know
it's<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.790> okay<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.269> if<00:04:02.569> I<00:04:02.659> want<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.900> get<00:04:03.019> a

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
it's like okay so if I want to get a

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.830 
it's like okay so if I want to get a
smartphone<00:04:03.379> now<00:04:03.829> can<00:04:04.340> get<00:04:04.730> an<00:04:05.000> iPhone<00:04:05.420> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
smartphone now can get an iPhone you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.210 
smartphone now can get an iPhone you
know<00:04:05.930> we<00:04:06.019> can<00:04:06.140> both<00:04:06.260> get<00:04:06.409> iPhones<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.099> will

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
know we can both get iPhones and it will

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.789 
know we can both get iPhones and it will
be<00:04:07.370> no<00:04:07.939> additional<00:04:08.090> cost<00:04:08.569> amount<00:04:08.930> at<00:04:09.170> all<00:04:09.409> and

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
be no additional cost amount at all and

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.220 
be no additional cost amount at all and
then<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.400> was<00:04:10.519> like<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.970> wonder<00:04:11.780> what<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.140> would

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
then I was like I wonder what you would

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.670 
then I was like I wonder what you would
cost<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.700> have<00:04:14.000> my<00:04:14.269> parents<00:04:14.629> included<00:04:15.379> I<00:04:15.500> was

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
cost to have my parents included I was

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.740 
cost to have my parents included I was
just<00:04:15.860> curious<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:17.000> would<00:04:17.090> actually<00:04:17.299> be

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
just curious and it would actually be

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.159 
just curious and it would actually be
cheaper<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.500> add<00:04:18.739> them<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:20.299> what<00:04:20.780> me<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:20.930> mal

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
cheaper to add them to what me and mal

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.360 
cheaper to add them to what me and mal
would<00:04:21.320> pay<00:04:22.090> then<00:04:23.090> for<00:04:23.870> my<00:04:24.830> parents<00:04:25.250> to

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
would pay then for my parents to

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.629 
would pay then for my parents to
continue<00:04:25.850> paying<00:04:26.180> what<00:04:26.510> they're<00:04:26.690> paying

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
continue paying what they're paying

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.040 
continue paying what they're paying
which<00:04:28.639> means<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.810> gonna<00:04:29.930> sound

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
which means and this is gonna sound

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.100 
which means and this is gonna sound
crazy<00:04:30.289> that<00:04:30.949> all<00:04:31.610> four<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.090> us<00:04:32.150> will<00:04:32.360> probably

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
crazy that all four of us will probably

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.590 
crazy that all four of us will probably
get<00:04:33.260> iPhones<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.130> year<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:35.389> it's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
get iPhones this year because it's

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.120 
get iPhones this year because it's
cheaper<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:35.990> my<00:04:36.229> parents<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.590> get<00:04:36.740> iPhones

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
cheaper for my parents to get iPhones

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.710 
cheaper for my parents to get iPhones
with<00:04:37.430> us<00:04:37.610> than<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.880> continue<00:04:38.150> paying<00:04:38.539> what

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
with us than to continue paying what

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.939 
with us than to continue paying what
they're<00:04:38.870> paying<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.289> they're<00:04:39.440> already<00:04:39.620> not

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
they're paying and they're already not

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.620 
they're paying and they're already not
paying<00:04:40.130> very<00:04:40.310> much<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.850> mean<00:04:41.120> don't<00:04:41.479> get<00:04:41.570> me

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
paying very much I mean don't get me

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.480 
paying very much I mean don't get me
wrong<00:04:41.690> it's<00:04:42.050> really<00:04:42.350> cool<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:43.010> mean<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.310> fact

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
wrong it's really cool I mean the fact

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.909 
wrong it's really cool I mean the fact
that<00:04:43.610> we<00:04:43.910> can<00:04:44.180> all<00:04:44.449> have<00:04:44.780> iPhones<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.770> it

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
that we can all have iPhones and it

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.409 
that we can all have iPhones and it
would<00:04:46.010> actually<00:04:46.190> be<00:04:46.550> cheaper<00:04:46.850> for<00:04:46.880> my<00:04:47.120> parents

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
would actually be cheaper for my parents

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.730 
would actually be cheaper for my parents
on<00:04:47.510> with<00:04:47.600> their<00:04:47.720> pay<00:04:47.810> now

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
on with their pay now

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.980 
on with their pay now
I<00:04:48.770> guess<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.699> funniest<00:04:50.060> part<00:04:50.449> of<00:04:50.539> all<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.840> this

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
I guess the funniest part of all of this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.939 
I guess the funniest part of all of this
is<00:04:51.400> imagining<00:04:52.400> my<00:04:52.610> parents<00:04:53.120> using<00:04:53.720> iPhones<00:04:54.470> my

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
is imagining my parents using iPhones my

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.200 
is imagining my parents using iPhones my
parents<00:04:55.310> aren't<00:04:55.430> exactly<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.970> most

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
parents aren't exactly the most

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.260 
parents aren't exactly the most
tech-savvy<00:04:56.630> people<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:58.520> feel<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:58.970> my<00:04:59.120> dad

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
tech-savvy people I feel like my dad

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.760 
tech-savvy people I feel like my dad
could<00:04:59.539> probably<00:04:59.750> get<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.199> hang<00:05:00.349> of<00:05:00.440> it<00:05:00.560> but

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
could probably get the hang of it but

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.250 
could probably get the hang of it but
it's<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.580> really<00:05:01.940> hard<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.630> imagine<00:05:02.780> my<00:05:03.050> mom

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
it's it's really hard to imagine my mom

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.290 
it's it's really hard to imagine my mom
using<00:05:04.130> an<00:05:04.220> iPhone<00:05:04.550> I'm<00:05:04.729> sure<00:05:04.849> both<00:05:05.000> of<00:05:05.180> them

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
using an iPhone I'm sure both of them

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.360 
using an iPhone I'm sure both of them
will<00:05:05.449> learn<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.660> mean<00:05:05.930> iOS<00:05:06.320> seems<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.250> be

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
will learn I mean iOS seems to be

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.570 
will learn I mean iOS seems to be
designed<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.150> ounces<00:05:08.360> words<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.260> Grandma<00:05:09.740> so

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
designed in ounces words for Grandma so

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.800 
designed in ounces words for Grandma so
I'm<00:05:10.729> sure<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.060> my<00:05:11.150> parents<00:05:11.419> will<00:05:11.510> get<00:05:11.660> it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
I'm sure that my parents will get it

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.020 
I'm sure that my parents will get it
it's<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.050> really<00:05:12.650> strange<00:05:13.160> for<00:05:13.490> example<00:05:13.820> um

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
it's just really strange for example um

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.540 
it's just really strange for example um
neither<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.080> my<00:05:15.110> parents<00:05:15.199> know<00:05:15.680> how<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.889> text

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
concept of it confuses them on the very

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.230 
concept of it confuses them on the very
few<00:05:24.680> occasions<00:05:25.099> I've<00:05:25.340> been<00:05:25.789> in<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:26.060> situation

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
few occasions I've been in a situation

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.879 
few occasions I've been in a situation
where<00:05:26.570> I<00:05:26.660> needed<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.990> text<00:05:27.320> them<00:05:27.470> sometimes

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
where I needed to text them sometimes

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.379 
where I needed to text them sometimes
they<00:05:28.099> don't<00:05:28.310> really<00:05:28.460> know<00:05:28.639> how<00:05:28.820> to<00:05:28.880> open<00:05:29.120> it

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
they don't really know how to open it

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.990 
they don't really know how to open it
and<00:05:29.599> read<00:05:29.960> it<00:05:30.099> so<00:05:31.099> they've<00:05:31.460> always<00:05:31.610> used<00:05:31.849> their

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
and read it so they've always used their

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.750 
and read it so they've always used their
phones<00:05:32.210> as<00:05:32.419> phones<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:34.160> suddenly<00:05:34.400> have
