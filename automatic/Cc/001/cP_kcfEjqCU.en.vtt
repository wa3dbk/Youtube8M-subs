I get fouled heading to the free-throw
line<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.530> this<00:05:58.040> has<00:05:58.310> been<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.700> theme<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.240> far

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
line and this has been the theme so far

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.150 
line and this has been the theme so far
getting<00:05:59.840> to<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.229> free-throw<00:06:00.470> line<00:06:00.680> and

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
getting to the free-throw line and

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.610 
getting to the free-throw line and
converting<00:06:01.910> on<00:06:02.060> it<00:06:02.240> so<00:06:02.900> far<00:06:03.229> I<00:06:03.260> have<00:06:03.590> not

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
converting on it so far I have not

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.980 
converting on it so far I have not
missed<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.430> shot<00:06:04.700> and<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.150> don't<00:06:05.479> miss<00:06:05.780> it<00:06:05.960> that

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
missed a shot and I don't miss it that

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.740 
missed a shot and I don't miss it that
time<00:06:06.440> and<00:06:06.740> unfortunately<00:06:07.400> I<00:06:08.000> do<00:06:08.060> get<00:06:08.419> subbed

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
time and unfortunately I do get subbed

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.850 
time and unfortunately I do get subbed
out<00:06:08.930> towards<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.530> end<00:06:09.800> for<00:06:10.010> some<00:06:10.280> reason

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
out towards the end for some reason

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.159 
out towards the end for some reason
even<00:06:11.099> though<00:06:11.250> it<00:06:11.610> was<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:11.789> blowout<00:06:12.150> they<00:06:12.900> should

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
even though it was a blowout they should

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.869 
even though it was a blowout they should
have<00:06:13.289> kept<00:06:13.530> me<00:06:13.680> in<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.860> game<00:06:13.889> so<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.550> can<00:06:14.759> get

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
have kept me in the game so I can get

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.700 
have kept me in the game so I can get
some<00:06:14.939> playing<00:06:15.330> time<00:06:15.629> and<00:06:15.689> some<00:06:15.930> skill<00:06:16.349> points

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
some playing time and some skill points

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.309 
some playing time and some skill points
but<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.460> coach<00:06:17.639> decides<00:06:18.210> to<00:06:18.479> sub<00:06:18.719> me<00:06:18.930> out<00:06:19.050> so

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
but the coach decides to sub me out so

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.529 
but the coach decides to sub me out so

tough not to get the win tonight with

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.129

the<00:06:59.069> way<00:06:59.219> you<00:06:59.279> play<00:06:59.639> did<00:07:00.509> you<00:07:00.629> feel<00:07:00.810> like<00:07:00.930> your

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
the way you play did you feel like your

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.450 
the way you play did you feel like your
effort<00:07:01.439> was<00:07:01.590> enough<00:07:01.889> knowing<00:07:02.219> that

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
effort was enough knowing that

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.689 
effort was enough knowing that
ultimately<00:07:03.000> it<00:07:03.240> led<00:07:03.479> to<00:07:03.509> a<00:07:03.659> loss<00:07:06.529> we<00:07:07.529> lost<00:07:07.800> so<00:07:08.669> i

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
ultimately it led to a loss we lost so i

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.080 
ultimately it led to a loss we lost so i
failed<00:07:09.240> it's<00:07:09.599> as<00:07:10.259> simple<00:07:10.469> as<00:07:10.710> that<00:07:10.939> you<00:07:11.939> may

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
failed it's as simple as that you may

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.939 
failed it's as simple as that you may
think<00:07:12.150> i<00:07:12.509> played<00:07:12.569> well<00:07:13.050> but<00:07:13.289> it<00:07:13.620> means<00:07:13.770> nothing

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 
think i played well but it means nothing

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.879 
think i played well but it means nothing
if<00:07:14.400> we<00:07:14.430> didn't<00:07:14.789> get<00:07:14.879> the<00:07:15.029> win<00:07:15.180> i<00:07:15.680> expect<00:07:16.680> to<00:07:16.770> win

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:16.889 
if we didn't get the win i expect to win

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.309 
if we didn't get the win i expect to win
every<00:07:16.949> single<00:07:17.460> game<00:07:17.940> i<00:07:18.419> step<00:07:18.750> on<00:07:18.930> the<00:07:19.080> court

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
every single game i step on the court

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.140 
every single game i step on the court
and<00:07:19.589> that<00:07:19.650> means<00:07:20.310> i'm<00:07:20.580> going<00:07:20.759> to<00:07:20.879> do<00:07:20.969> whatever

and that means i'm going to do whatever

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.300 
and that means i'm going to do whatever
it<00:07:21.330> takes<00:07:21.599> to<00:07:21.690> make<00:07:21.870> that<00:07:22.020> happen<00:07:22.080> and<00:07:22.680> i

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
it takes to make that happen and i

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.559 
it takes to make that happen and i
wasn't<00:07:23.490> able<00:07:23.669> to<00:07:23.819> do<00:07:23.969> that<00:07:24.089> for<00:07:24.270> my<00:07:24.360> team
