00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
that we wanted to deliver this is a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.400 
that we wanted to deliver this is a
one-two<00:03:44.400> punch<00:03:44.430> where<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.090> were<00:03:45.420> taking<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
one-two punch where we were taking the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
climactic moment that you can start the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.620 
climactic moment that you can start the
game<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.430> needed<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:50.850> what<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> ending

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
game we needed to know what the ending

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.030 
game we needed to know what the ending
of<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.810> game<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.410> could<00:03:52.560> push<00:03:52.709> toward

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
of the game was so I could push toward

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.009 
of the game was so I could push toward
that<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> book<00:03:54.090> also<00:03:54.269> had<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.690> feel<00:03:54.870> like

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
that but the book also had to feel like

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.690 
that but the book also had to feel like
its<00:03:55.170> own<00:03:55.290> co<00:03:55.440> easy<00:03:55.620> oh<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.920> couldn't<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.459> write

its own co easy oh I couldn't like write

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.550 
its own co easy oh I couldn't like write
a<00:03:56.730> book<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.870> end<00:03:58.079> right<00:03:58.410> when

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560

a book and then have you end right when
it<00:03:58.650> starts<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.040> exciting<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.700> had<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.090> have

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
it starts to get exciting it had to have

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.690 
it starts to get exciting it had to have
its<00:04:00.450> own<00:04:00.540> arc<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> lot<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.459> the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
its own arc and so a lot of the
