00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.660
 hello today, nitro is in front of you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.720
 Nation 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.450
 this is the beta version of the game i finally 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.279
 I received the key and today I will show you this 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.160
 the game the game is available for free 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.960
 register on the market and wait 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.000
 participation in beta testing 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.579
 and so what we see at the beginning when 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.220
 go in the game and see the options settings 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.300
 Profile Other games from the company Well here 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.910
 actually everything is standard by the system 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.240
 measurements in general then let's remove 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 the volume so that nothing would disturb us 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:56.120
 go ahead see the standard menu here 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.430
 such is the type of competition that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.440
 openly give time some objects more 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.330
 not active because their just like that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 still did not lead ie toy beta 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:11.090
 as I told you, and so the mail box 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.069
 here is the same test for now let's 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.020
 let's go to the garage let's see what we have 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.990
 cars look at the level of graphics 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.439
 look at the available customization and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.700
 so drive the car you can go to the list 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.899
 I donâ€™t find a little list of machines 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.109
 choose which one is available here 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.799
 me and 2 this car opened after 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.060
 passing the first top five 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.889
 gonna kill 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.950
 let's see let's see what u 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:46.939
 we have a shop there is here you can 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.920
 brands see all cars as you see 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.770
 licensed ie real 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 really existing here this 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 I especially want a typewriter 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 level of graphics I think you can see 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.409
 if they say she's amazing but 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.569
 it at least amazes the graphics 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.330
 super 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.100
 smoothness 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.250
 anti-aliasing, that is, no 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.120
 no defects see actually looks 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.270
 just wow wow wow wow no other way 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.070
 say cars are expensive and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.720
 to buy them we have to 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.370
 zadroty about customizing how 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.100
 Machines can be painted answer can 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.850
 will add to the decor and change disks 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.430
 we somehow darken the glass but for now 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.350
 it is not available 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 let's see how you can change 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.690
 colors 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.950
 glossy metallic standard 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.790
 carboxylic if you look at carbon 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.690
 it is clear that he is really carbon 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.360
 mother of pearl and mat price of $ 100 or 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 little things 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.380
 from the other 120 and will not just paint 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.080
 let's see how it looks brighter 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.640
 can be darker here you can do 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.410
 brighter choose the color itself 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.900
 in fact, a lot of each 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.150
 part 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.459
 paint separately now let's do 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.670
 such a matte trunk or carbonic 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.489
 black roof that is either carbon fiber 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.550
 also a black mirror is actually it 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:38.100
 very interesting and this I have not seen 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:42.440
 not a single bumper door toy it all 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:47.280
 painted separately as you can see 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.680
 so actually already even us on 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.989
 here on the version 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.620
 here's a beta test 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.280
 already have a bunch of functions go on there 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.739
 upgrade 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.510
 Naturally here from tuning you can 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.239
 choose our car see how much we have 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.280
 money and see the type of tuning tourist here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:12.989
 essentially the engine turbine box fence 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.530
 air wheel nitrogen relief that is 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.700
 here 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.570
 as you can see everything goes slowly 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.690
 slowly goes you pump 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.530
 choose what you need and really 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.880
 drive you would not say what to play here 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.480
 hard to win in principle really 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.760
 let's try press the flight you can 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.030
 career can be one-on-one go on 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.870
 I understand one as a network player 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.870
 so let's try to ride 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.319
 he looks like this 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.750
 but you can see for yourself the graphics level 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.400
 detail in general level itself here 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.389
 gear shift is this whole 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.450
 the interface is all very nicely made 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:20.330
 unobtrusive everything is done interesting and 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.460
 the most important thing is simply that is 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.450
 on what does not seem to make any other 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.900
 toys 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.950
 let's try the training is different 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.080
 that we choose someone 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:37.940
 unpretentious 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:40.040
 player rather not even player bot hands 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:47.570
 certainly not quite perfect and 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:50.240
 you need to finish it still very beautiful 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.840
 Looks much more interesting than 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.710
 all sorts there viper tv service all 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.830
 gathered and that is this toy though 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.270
 for this she has hellish potential and she 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.370
 really very much to me 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.460
 liked it we will see what will happen 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.680
 continue to pump cars to play 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.930
 play and basically when this toy 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.729
 will be released when she is not on stage 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.240
 beta testing did another review 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.890
 let's see how it has changed 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.090
 actually all I wanted to show 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.820
 This moment in the game is not so much 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.160
 features so many cars and piste trail 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.250
 give back in general 1 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.630
 but the game develops you see what 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.940
 graphics you see what control 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.280
 Thank you all for your attention

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.450
