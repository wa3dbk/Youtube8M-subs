felt only when you look back and think

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.710 
felt only when you look back and think
God<00:00:53.449> I<00:00:54.190> did<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.370> when<00:00:55.519> I<00:00:55.550> was<00:00:55.610> 18<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:56.300> it's

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
God I did that when I was 18 it's it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.259 
God I did that when I was 18 it's it's
it's<00:00:57.350> pretty<00:00:57.530> young<00:00:57.829> but<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.820> say<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.000> think

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
it's pretty young but you say I think

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.910 
it's pretty young but you say I think
that<00:00:59.359> works<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.140> your<00:01:00.230> advantage<00:01:00.289> in<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.890> way

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
that works to your advantage in a way

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.470 
that works to your advantage in a way
when<00:01:01.219> you're<00:01:01.340> young<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.730> just<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.210> think<00:01:02.329> you

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
when you're young you just you think you

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.530 
when you're young you just you think you
can<00:01:02.629> do<00:01:03.170> anything

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.420 

well<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.140> can<00:01:12.350> recall<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:12.920> because<00:01:13.280> I've

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
well I can recall it now because I've

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.100 
well I can recall it now because I've
seen<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.880> loads<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.240> times<00:01:14.420> on<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.690> telly<00:01:14.900> but

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
seen it loads of times on the telly but

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.660 
seen it loads of times on the telly but
if<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.470> had<00:01:15.560> asked<00:01:15.710> me<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:16.010> happens<00:01:16.430> right

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
if you had asked me what happens right

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.750 
if you had asked me what happens right
after<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> game<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.480> would<00:01:17.870> have<00:01:17.990> struggled<00:01:18.650> to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
after the game I would have struggled to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.940 
after the game I would have struggled to
think<00:01:19.760> exactly<00:01:19.910> how<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.020> know<00:01:21.170> where<00:01:21.920> I

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
think exactly how you know where I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.070 
think exactly how you know where I
controlled<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.730> ball<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.240> how<00:01:23.690> many<00:01:23.840> players

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
controlled the ball and how many players

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.810 
controlled the ball and how many players
are<00:01:24.320> B<00:01:24.500> or<00:01:24.770> anything<00:01:25.370> else<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:25.760> that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
are B or anything else like that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.030 
are B or anything else like that
obviously<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> know<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:27.350> too<00:01:27.560> well<00:01:27.590> what

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
obviously now I know all too well what

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.210 
obviously now I know all too well what
happens<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.790> by<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.780> Beckerman<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.920> first

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
happens and by the Beckerman the first

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.160 
happens and by the Beckerman the first
talks<00:01:31.400> was<00:01:31.610> good<00:01:31.820> took<00:01:32.570> away<00:01:32.840> from<00:01:32.870> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
talks was good took away from the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.780 
talks was good took away from the
defender<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.770> managed<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> show<00:01:34.430> him<00:01:34.610> off

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
defender and managed to show him off

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.550 
defender and managed to show him off
from<00:01:34.910> using<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.540> place<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.870> get<00:01:35.990> faster<00:01:36.380> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
from using a place to get faster and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.950 
from using a place to get faster and
then<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:36.830> just<00:01:37.730> it<00:01:38.240> felt<00:01:38.420> normal<00:01:38.810> at<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:38.930> time

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
then I just it felt normal at the time

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.080 
then I just it felt normal at the time
but<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.470> look<00:01:39.620> back<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.160> replays<00:01:40.940> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
but now you look back on the replays and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.090 
but now you look back on the replays and
you<00:01:41.180> can't<00:01:41.390> believe<00:01:41.510> how<00:01:41.870> deep<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.410> in<00:01:42.980> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
you can't believe how deep the in the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.130 
you can't believe how deep the in the
centre<00:01:43.430> half<00:01:43.580> was<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.390> by<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.750> time<00:01:44.960> I'd

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
centre half was but by that time I'd

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.480 
centre half was but by that time I'd
built<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.500> much<00:01:45.620> in<00:01:45.770> momentum<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.250> could<00:01:46.400> have

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
built so much in momentum I could have

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.510 
built so much in momentum I could have
gone<00:01:46.580> anywhere<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.630> got<00:01:48.410> past<00:01:48.650> him<00:01:48.860> really<00:01:49.160> he

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
gone anywhere and got past him really he

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.820 
gone anywhere and got past him really he
was<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.790> pretty<00:01:50.320> impossible<00:01:51.320> position<00:01:51.440> to

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
was in a pretty impossible position to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.240 
was in a pretty impossible position to
defend<00:01:52.070> them<00:01:52.370> from<00:01:52.400> their<00:01:52.990> suicidal

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
defend them from their suicidal

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.410 
defend them from their suicidal
informational<00:01:55.250> very<00:01:55.610> well<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.090> there's<00:01:56.390> a

when we played Argentina four years

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.870 
when we played Argentina four years
later<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.800> next<00:02:20.040> work<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.489> work<00:02:20.640> too

the best team but we were better in

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.690 
the best team but we were better in
