 This is a cord for connecting to a player or

 phone with headphones and it is actually 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:05.600
 The headphones themselves are very headphones 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:10.400
 qualitatively and I'm sorry I could not resist 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.159
 already listened to them well, or rather not their 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.799

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.789
 true nowhere sure that in our 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.789
 yellowtop can do something better 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.190
 if a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.910
 baptize the headphones then they themselves 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.700
 give this a fake but if that's the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.410
 segments 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.910
