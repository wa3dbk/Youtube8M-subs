00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 for this we need 1 cup 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.939
 red lentils two carrots one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 onion a few cloves of garlic 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 small piece of ginger handful 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 First we prepare all the vegetables and 1 and I 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.020
 I clean the carrot and cut it enough 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.510
 I like it in large pieces 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.079
 more you can cut so like 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.079
 you cut onions in the usual way 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.190
 and 3 cloves of garlic I first clear of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.070
 skins it is much easier to do if 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.150
 crush a clove with a knife and then 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 the skin is very easily removed 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.590
 then I chop the garlic with a knife 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 now we also need to cut as much as possible 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.970

 pour lentils in three circles of water and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.400
