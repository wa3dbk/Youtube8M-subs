00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
fast it is alright so I'm looking at my

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.800 
fast it is alright so I'm looking at my
camera<00:03:43.769> here<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.130> what<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.670> time<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:44.910> so

camera here to see what the time is so

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.750 
camera here to see what the time is so
it<00:03:45.959> loaded<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.590> about<00:03:46.680> five<00:03:47.190> seconds

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it loaded that in about five seconds

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.479 
it loaded that in about five seconds
which<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:47.970> very<00:03:48.390> very<00:03:48.630> fast<00:03:48.989> for<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.920> size<00:03:50.310> of

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
which is very very fast for this size of

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.600 
which is very very fast for this size of
a<00:03:50.550> web<00:03:50.760> page<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.330> all<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.019> content<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.610> for

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
a 3g network that is extremely fast so i

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.670 
a 3g network that is extremely fast so i
gotta<00:03:57.480> get<00:03:57.660> big<00:03:57.870> ups<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.110> them<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.380> I've<00:03:58.440> tried

gotta get big ups to them and I've tried

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.190 
gotta get big ups to them and I've tried

use of done youtube videos on this I've
watched<00:04:01.410> them<00:04:01.620> over<00:04:02.459> 3g<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.600> does<00:04:03.930> take<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
watched them over 3g it does take the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.860 
watched them over 3g it does take the
quality<00:04:05.310> down<00:04:05.459> sometimes<00:04:06.090> on<00:04:06.300> certain<00:04:06.570> videos

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
quality down sometimes on certain videos

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.330 
quality down sometimes on certain videos
depending<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.350> your<00:04:07.440> connection<00:04:07.920> speed<00:04:08.010> which

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
depending on your connection speed which

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.430 
depending on your connection speed which
gets<00:04:08.519> kind<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.730> annoying<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.840> overall<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
gets kind of annoying but overall the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.810 
gets kind of annoying but overall the
quality<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.890> great<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.459> streams<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
quality is great and it streams the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.550 
quality is great and it streams the
straight<00:04:12.060> fast<00:04:12.360> now<00:04:12.930> another<00:04:13.170> thing<00:04:13.260> i<00:04:13.410> want

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
straight fast now another thing i want

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.430 
straight fast now another thing i want
to<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.709> really<00:04:13.860> quick<00:04:14.130> was<00:04:14.310> do<00:04:15.109> this<00:04:16.109> test

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to do really quick was do this test

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.400 
to do really quick was do this test
right<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.120> test<00:04:18.390> your<00:04:18.690> mobile

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
right here this is this test your mobile

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.320 
right here this is this test your mobile
broadband<00:04:19.950> speed<00:04:20.310> which<00:04:20.700> basically<00:04:20.970> test<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
broadband speed which basically test the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.240 
broadband speed which basically test the
speed<00:04:21.540> of<00:04:21.630> your<00:04:21.750> 3g<00:04:22.620> network<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.160> i'm<00:04:23.220> just

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
speed of your 3g network so i'm just

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.040 
speed of your 3g network so i'm just
going<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.490> put<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.729> right<00:04:23.910> here<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.300> it's

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
going to put this right here and it's

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.230 
going to put this right here and it's
going<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.229> show<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.530> download<00:04:26.039> speed<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
going to show the download speed and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.760 
going to show the download speed and
the<00:04:27.300> upload<00:04:27.720> speed<00:04:27.750> for<00:04:28.319> some<00:04:28.440> reason<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the upload speed for some reason to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.409 
the upload speed for some reason to
download<00:04:29.099> speeds<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.370> really<00:04:29.550> working<00:04:29.880> but

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
download speeds and really working but

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.570 
download speeds and really working but
as<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.720> see<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.199> upload<00:04:31.620> speed<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:32.220> at

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
as you can see the upload speed is at

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.650 
as you can see the upload speed is at
this<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.330> over<00:04:33.599> 3g<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.080> course<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:35.360> at<00:04:36.360> about

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
this is over 3g of course is at about

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.200 
this is over 3g of course is at about
point<00:04:39.660> oh<00:04:40.259> that's<00:04:41.009> actually<00:04:41.280> that's<00:04:42.060> actually

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
point oh that's actually that's actually

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.550 
point oh that's actually that's actually
worse<00:04:42.569> than<00:04:42.599> I've<00:04:42.810> got<00:04:42.930> before<00:04:43.080> but<00:04:43.410> as<00:04:43.470> you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
worse than I've got before but as you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.279 
worse than I've got before but as you
can<00:04:43.650> see<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.979> average<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.550> really<00:04:45.289> about

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
can see the average is really about

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.490 
can see the average is really about
point<00:04:46.830> nine<00:04:47.370> or<00:04:47.819> point<00:04:48.330> eight<00:04:48.509> megabytes<00:04:48.960> per

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
point nine or point eight megabytes per

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.200 
point nine or point eight megabytes per
second<00:04:49.919> which<00:04:50.009> is<00:04:50.039> pretty<00:04:50.370> fast<00:04:50.699> for<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.910> 3g

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
second which is pretty fast for a 3g

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
second which is pretty fast for a 3g
network<00:04:51.240> um<00:04:51.780> there<00:04:52.470> are<00:04:52.500> some<00:04:52.680> other
