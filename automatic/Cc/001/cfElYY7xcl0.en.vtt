we're<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> add<00:02:47.520> oil-based<00:02:48.390> stain<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
we're going to add oil-based stain to it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.710 
we're going to add oil-based stain to it
and<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.550> using<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.210> measuring

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and you can do that using a measuring

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570 
and you can do that using a measuring
spoon<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.650> recommend<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.280> write

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
spoon and I recommend that you write

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.400 
spoon and I recommend that you write
down<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.090> formula<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.990> repeat<00:02:55.350> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
down the formula so you can repeat it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.160 
down the formula so you can repeat it
later<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.850> get<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.209> determine<00:02:57.360> exactly

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
later and you get to determine exactly

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
later and you get to determine exactly

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.920 
with that as well now when I'm putting
on<00:03:35.100> my<00:03:35.250> paste<00:03:35.489> wax<00:03:35.760> are<00:03:36.000> usually<00:03:36.390> work<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
on my paste wax are usually work in a

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.050 
on my paste wax are usually work in a
circular<00:03:37.290> motion<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.430> apply<00:03:38.760> good

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
circular motion and I apply good

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120 
circular motion and I apply good
pressure<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.989> want<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.290> work<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.830> wax

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
pressure because I want to work that wax

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.300 
pressure because I want to work that wax
into<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.820> pores<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> wood<00:03:42.800> then<00:03:43.800> we<00:03:44.160> have

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
into the pores of the wood then we have

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
into the pores of the wood then we have
to<00:03:44.459> watch<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.940> clock<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.930> point<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.440> want

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
to watch the clock at this point we want

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.340 
to watch the clock at this point we want
our<00:03:46.920> wax<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.430> begin<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.000> dry<00:03:48.300> but<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.140> don't

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
our wax to begin to dry but we don't

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.080 
our wax to begin to dry but we don't
want<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.769> completely<00:03:50.190> hardened<00:03:50.640> because

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
want it to completely hardened because

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.759 
want it to completely hardened because
then<00:03:51.450> our<00:03:51.480> swirling<00:03:52.170> marks<00:03:52.500> would<00:03:52.650> be

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
then our swirling marks would be

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.830 
then our swirling marks would be
permanent<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.459> we're<00:03:54.300> going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.480> wait<00:03:54.690> about

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
permanent so we're going to wait about

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.530 
permanent so we're going to wait about
five<00:03:55.290> minutes<00:03:55.620> then<00:03:56.070> take<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.400> soft<00:03:56.880> rag<00:03:57.269> and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
five minutes then take a soft rag and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.110 
five minutes then take a soft rag and
begin<00:03:58.110> gently<00:03:58.590> buffing<00:03:59.070> one<00:03:59.370> portion<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.000> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
begin gently buffing one portion of it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.080 
begin gently buffing one portion of it
if<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> nice<00:04:01.230> hard<00:04:01.769> Sheen<00:04:02.160> form<00:04:02.670> under
