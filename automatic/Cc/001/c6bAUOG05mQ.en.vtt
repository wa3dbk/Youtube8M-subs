00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.860
 for a small bone that has been largely 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.210
 of the world and that's the tutorial on my way 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.710
 which I always start by applying it 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.300
 lip balm that will allow you to 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.040
 nourish my lips throughout 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.180
 makeup or a perfect application 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.829
 lipstick later I start 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.260
 by applying a base on my eyelids 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.690
 I am the theme mate except in the heart of 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.570
 at mac and I just apply it on 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.160
 the entire eyelid going back to 6 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.219
 and I do not forget also to me 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.500
 discount on the period to actually like it's 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 a black-collar crime inside of 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.890
 the eye 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.829
 then I also come to apply it 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.710

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.899
