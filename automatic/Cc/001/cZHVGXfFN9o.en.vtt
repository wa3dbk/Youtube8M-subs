ordered them and I receive them they
matched<00:02:18.120> perfectly<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.050> once<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.440> close

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
matched perfectly and once you get close

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.330 
matched perfectly and once you get close
to<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.099> top<00:02:20.310> they<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.819> smaller<00:02:21.300> sections

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
to the top they have smaller sections

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.020 
to the top they have smaller sections
that<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.489> can<00:02:23.640> easily<00:02:23.940> clip<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.019> hide

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
usually when you get sets that don't

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.530 
usually when you get sets that don't
have<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.860> smaller<00:02:29.250> individual<00:02:30.030> sections

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
have the smaller individual sections

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.199 
have the smaller individual sections
you'll<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> tracks<00:02:31.980> up<00:02:32.220> top<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
you'll really see the tracks up top so

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.490 
you'll really see the tracks up top so
once<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> top<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.230> want<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.440> make

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
once you get to the top you want to make

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.580 
once you get to the top you want to make

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
sure you use the smaller sections so you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860
