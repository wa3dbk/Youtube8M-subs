00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.930 
ad side opening up the other half of the
court<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.440> another<00:02:27.920> great<00:02:28.250> time<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.760> hit<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
court that's another great time to hit a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.780 
court that's another great time to hit a
swing<00:02:29.330> volley<00:02:29.710> because<00:02:30.710> usually<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.370> someone

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
swing volley because usually if someone

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.300 
swing volley because usually if someone
is<00:02:31.910> stretched<00:02:32.440> they're<00:02:33.440> gonna<00:02:33.590> lob<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.280> ball

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
is stretched they're gonna lob the ball

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.990 
is stretched they're gonna lob the ball
and<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:35.600> we<00:02:35.780> back<00:02:36.050> up<00:02:36.080> too<00:02:36.530> far<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.610> play<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and if we back up too far to play the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.780 
and if we back up too far to play the
law<00:02:38.180> back<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.170> gives<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.680> opponent<00:02:39.950> time<00:02:40.460> to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
law back it gives the opponent time to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.380 
law back it gives the opponent time to
get<00:02:40.970> back<00:02:41.240> in<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.870> court<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.460> I'm<00:02:43.970> gonna<00:02:44.180> back
