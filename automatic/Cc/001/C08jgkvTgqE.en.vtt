00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shown on Halloween so I went to check

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
shown on Halloween so I went to check
that<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> bits<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.449> bullshit

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that out and that bits a bit of bullshit

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
that out and that bits a bit of bullshit
because<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.469> shown<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.860> November<00:00:53.610> the

because that was shown on November the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
because that was shown on November the
19th<00:00:54.149> 5th<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> crap<00:00:55.379> he

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
19th 5th so that was a bit of crap he

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
19th 5th so that was a bit of crap he
was<00:00:55.500> telling<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.879> found<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
was telling there but I really found it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
was telling there but I really found it
interesting<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:57.930> said<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> could<00:00:58.739> be

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
interesting how he said that it could be

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
interesting how he said that it could be
shown<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> date<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.910> Halloween<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.230> that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
shown on the date of Halloween so that's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
shown on the date of Halloween so that's
really<00:01:01.590> interesting<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.370> found<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> really

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really interesting I found that really

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
really interesting I found that really

multiplayer<00:01:11.130> Osho<00:01:11.580> campaign<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.240> I've<00:01:12.360> said

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
multiplayer Osho campaign like I've said

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
multiplayer Osho campaign like I've said
my<00:01:12.600> previous<00:01:12.990> videos<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> makes<00:01:14.130> sense<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
my previous videos so it makes sense to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
my previous videos so it makes sense to
actually<00:01:14.760> show<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.360> Halloween<00:01:15.810> maybe<00:01:16.170> it'd

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
actually show it on Halloween maybe it'd

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
actually show it on Halloween maybe it'd
be<00:01:16.380> smart<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.640> nice<00:01:17.970> things<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> tray

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
be smart and really nice things to tray

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.050 
be smart and really nice things to tray
up<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> actually<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> such<00:01:20.520> an<00:01:20.700> exciting

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
up to actually do on a such an exciting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
up to actually do on a such an exciting
day<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.360> us<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:22.409> point<00:01:22.560> I'd

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
day for us so that's the first point I'd

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
day for us so that's the first point I'd
like<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.420> Plus<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.450> doesn't<00:01:24.990> link<00:01:25.140> him

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
like to make Plus this doesn't link him

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.539 
like to make Plus this doesn't link him
with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> trailer<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.130> another<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
with the trailer but it's another bit of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
with the trailer but it's another bit of
information<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.479> thought<00:01:27.630> I'd<00:01:27.780> put<00:01:27.930> into

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
information I just thought I'd put into

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
information I just thought I'd put into
this<00:01:28.320> video<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.009> isn't<00:01:29.220> long<00:01:29.369> enough

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
this video because it isn't long enough

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.060 
this video because it isn't long enough
to<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.630> separate<00:01:31.049> videos<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to make in two separate videos now it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
to make in two separate videos now it
the<00:01:32.280> other<00:01:32.369> day<00:01:32.610> treyarch<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.570> posted

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the other day treyarch actually posted

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
the other day treyarch actually posted
this<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.860> their<00:01:35.189> twitter<00:01:35.549> page<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:36.000> actually

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this on their twitter page they actually

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
this on their twitter page they actually
changed<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> their<00:01:36.930> profile<00:01:37.350> picture<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
changed it to their profile picture and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100 
changed it to their profile picture and
again<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.850> similar<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> image<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
again it's similar to the image that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
again it's similar to the image that
they<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.350> posted<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.040> few<00:01:41.220> days<00:01:41.460> before

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
they actually posted a few days before

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.270 
they actually posted a few days before
this<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.299> again<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> an<00:01:43.530> emblem<00:01:44.009> sign

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this one again it's like an emblem sign

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
this one again it's like an emblem sign
a<00:01:44.610> zombies<00:01:45.090> hand<00:01:45.329> coming<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.899> time

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a zombies hand coming out this time

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
a zombies hand coming out this time
looks<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> zombies<00:01:47.070> hun<00:01:47.220> last<00:01:47.729> time

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
looks like it's a zombies hun last time

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
looks like it's a zombies hun last time
it<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> zombie's<00:01:48.840> face<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.229> again

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it was like a zombie's face so again

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
it was like a zombie's face so again
this<00:01:49.829> could<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.369> ambling<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.030> black<00:01:51.210> ops<00:01:51.360> 2

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this could be an ambling for black ops 2

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
this could be an ambling for black ops 2
zombies<00:01:51.630> maybe<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.290> could<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> press<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
zombies maybe we could have a press the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
zombies maybe we could have a press the
edge<00:01:53.100> system<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.540> to
