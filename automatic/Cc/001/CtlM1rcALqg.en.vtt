work on future jailbreaks because this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030

is<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.750> date<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.170> they've<00:00:13.349> been<00:00:13.559> updating

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
is up to date and they've been updating

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
is up to date and they've been updating
this<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.059> shows<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> do

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this I have a video that shows how to do

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.070 
this I have a video that shows how to do
it<00:00:15.990> using<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.289> package<00:00:16.619> called<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.070> AP<00:00:17.460> free

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
it using a package called I AP free

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
it using a package called I AP free
however<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.560> source<00:00:19.920> um<00:00:20.279> no<00:00:20.640> longer<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
however that source um no longer is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.240 
however that source um no longer is
available<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.619> third<00:00:22.949> party

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
available but you can get on third party

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.290 
available but you can get on third party
sources<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.699> they're<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> be

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
sources but they're not going to be

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.990 
sources but they're not going to be
updating<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.859> might<00:00:26.369> probably<00:00:26.640> won't

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
updating it so it might probably won't

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
updating it so it might probably won't
work<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.359> future<00:00:27.720> apps<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.619> next<00:00:28.769> big

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
work with future apps then the next big

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
work with future apps then the next big
thing<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.510> way<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.929> probably<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
thing so this way is probably the way to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
thing so this way is probably the way to
go<00:00:31.560> since<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.130> still<00:00:32.489> running<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.480> just

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
go since they're still running so just

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
go since they're still running so just
add<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> source<00:00:34.230> system<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> focus

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
add the source system on the focus

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.819 
add the source system on the focus
system<00:00:36.690> die<00:00:37.079> n<00:00:37.500> dot<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.910> mean<00:00:39.420> system<00:00:39.870> die<00:00:39.989> n<00:00:40.290> App

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
system die n dot I mean system die n App

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.810 
system die n dot I mean system die n App
