00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello 5 today at the end of life to a small video percent on a 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.189
 new open tuning hoping that it will give you plenty of ideas for the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:08.689
 after 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.879
 to create your own pieces to enhance 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.929
 here is your game then following a different touch 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.699
 so today we worked on a new dolphin tunis 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.220
 to note a small number of votes 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 treille 7 4 I'll explain what it's all about I take my guitar 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.989
 but 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.909
 open tuning two doses but 7 to 10 years to go to work in Switzerland smokes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.760
 it contains a seventh and a map 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.050
 a map instead of having a shot on a map so it's top 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.370
 an agreement by the suspended 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.480
 I add a map 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.610
 or rather we substitute a third by the case 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.330
 and we love this agreement here is a respite agreement 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.070
 the old 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 gift that we have there how it is still small late so issigeac a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.020
 for second place because it makes the game easier it allows to 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.970
 he does not intend the accounts so gives the notes 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.950
 since yesterday with the hood of astra 2nd cat of course and if you get a mother 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.550
 it's a tuning that I discovered through quality to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.310
 women know artists 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.250
 whom I adore and who is one of 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.890
 but very big affluence 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.540
 she uses it especially in a piece called qu'athÃ¨nes boutemane 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 if you are familiar with his records 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.070
 listen to this ascetic open tuning and the way you use 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.540
 no today we just want 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 it is a very very nice exercise we will do% alternate picket 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.890
 even with the bass 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 however for the thumb 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 and you're going to play 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 meza 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.730
 I try to keep his anonymity in account I use mainly the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 the decline and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.819
 and then of course we can use the sea 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.859
 in general I use the lower and middle fingers when I'm doing 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.139
 bikini 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.870
 so she sports plan in other words 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.220
 so we are I remind you someone for the second place and then we go 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.229
 start here 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.989
 I could give myself the ap encryption by counting the hood it would be more 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.159
 simple so the fifth place after the second album hood 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.519
 always there internet 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.309
 quite simply 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.440
 itie the fifth the second 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 virginia woolf 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.439
 35 2 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.299
 in a month 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.479
 on the rope 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.059
 now on the ground rope one is second thanks to the fourth place 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.259
 so you play ramadan 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.459
 comes next you play the back rope lavitola 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.419
 we start again slowly 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.229
 in order to maria on foot 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.799
 abandonment 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.009
 quarter 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.009
 and instead of playing the clever fingers rope we will play this step 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.649
 by putting your finger 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.129
 so the first see on the second map 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.129
 what they want to do 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
 so we can even do the rower then 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 so if you alternate the two that's it 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.849
 then another type 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.639
 they shared two of the work that can be done on them for their fees he has 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.379
 more 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.379
 in this agreement a day can for example make 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.680
 3 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.680
 on this rope so of re 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.159
 it was the same thing on the rope the stop 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.889
 so there actually pee that does not intervene by simply lowering 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.669
 if you find it working 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.339
 so with the thumb playing on the rope there 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.479
 and with that the index finger on the ground rope 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.300
 the middle finger on the rope of doubt 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.409
 it's the cost of gasoline on a tight rope 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.759
 but these are just examples where you can not play your thing the idea is 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.259
 the idea that I want that I want to get through this video is that 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.740
 the bce that allow you to open 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.449
 your mind that sense 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.189
 without playing she laments that you've played hundreds of times 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.189
 the idea is to discover new aspects of music 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.849
 because when you have no benchmarks 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.490
 at the level of disagreements and positions you have to use your 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.169
 ears before all the most important it's that you use your ears 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.560
 we can find the beautiful agreement on this kind of themes that we 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.669
 appear in sarthe 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.669
 the lensois 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:19.389
 in the data waiter is not looking for 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.469
 and if I wanted notes try to see what goes with 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.050
 what will sink more sets so we'll go back to our departure thing 

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.049
 in the case of internet picking 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.240
 we have some ideas and I hope that 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.879
 it allowed us to discover 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.800
 this year this agreement of broad fixed device traces will have mostly given you 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.809
 new ideas for reworking on the guitar
