00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.770
 And then, guys, I'm going to teach you today what 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.220
 Brazil will reduce in the future 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.119
 It's very easy to do 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.510
 It's harder for us to call you 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.480
 huh 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.869
 but the name is kind of easy so let's go and 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.400
 forget to talk I'll go to the accounts 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 personally this is all for several 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 enrolled 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.170
 this is the mouse I'm with the galaxy nÃ© 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.030
 It's the galaxy sorry when that brightness 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.489
 This brightness I won. 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.020
 Thank you, I have my camera here. 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.070
 so come on people I'll start with 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 basic ear 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 the first we now want the ear, right? 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.460
 I do not know if it's good, but the video here 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.560
 ok right 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 I'll paint it be cute is 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:38.390
 now the basic hair is 16 and it's going 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:42.830
 stay all the time, no more, because I think 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.990
 that he's the same I'm sure I will 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.960
 try 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.790
 I think it will not be long 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.119
 I think it's cool to meet all the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 Fandom mistakes we'll be using the pencil 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.040
 black and brown pencils standing and 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.600
 preference of castle castle corrected 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:12.140
 god use to wear ruler 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:18.220
 here I'm going to use the 23 bring the eye 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 red night to from within 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.870
 The team here was perfect. 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:36.790
 People I've tried these and other lists 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.790
 so that I can remember that it is 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:47.830
 Dark and I ended up sending it. I'm going to paint. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.830
 already the part that I 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.230
 here I think the drawing will stay in 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.230
 return 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.660
 this one stays lahore look who calls 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.060
 call me trash, let alone make video 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.720
 Look, if anyone calls me an animal, I guess. 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.400
 that I will not do more video and do 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.980
 If that's what I'm going to do a 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.760
 class so someone calls me trash 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.870
 I'm going to find myself not reporting anything 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.430
 steal nothing 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.680
 You feel excluded then we 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.360

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:52.720

 cause I'm not going to talk like this 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.400

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.739

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.130
