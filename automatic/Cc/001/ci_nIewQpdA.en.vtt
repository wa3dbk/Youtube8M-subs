00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.280
 let's move it and paste them in what 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 is the the android device then I do not know 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.969

 video so you can try it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 so let's connect our 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 Android device to the computer 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.710
 via usb cable and let's open it 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 remember I have this tablet 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.150
 an example I also have a folder 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.299
 let's find a folder that I call 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 test apps is here is this to 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 you prove that you have different 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 apps in apk format and we're going to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 take this file called menu of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.650

 transferring and we already have it in the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.649
 folder then you have to have a manager 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.500
 file on your device so that 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.539

 we ready and created the different 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.370
 Shortcuts for example let's 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.770
 click here and we get 12 minutes of 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.110
 start windows xp here we can see 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.000
 all the applications that we have to see 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610
 the whole application we have in our 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 Android device here we can go 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.420
 also to the system configuration 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 as you can appreciate here we can change 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.440

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.170
 the excess as we can see here 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.209
 x we can choose by default we can 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.450

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.440
 Preciate to take the windows 7 and so 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.880
 successively 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.590
 here are also the different 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.629
 applications that we see and share 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.260
 as you can see here applications that 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.430
 we have recently used for example 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.970
 but also as you prefer it comes out here 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.400
 we can not close it is a very 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.379
 practice of having access to all 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.060
 applications are easier 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.430
 applications that we have to our 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.099
 Android device with skin 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.489
