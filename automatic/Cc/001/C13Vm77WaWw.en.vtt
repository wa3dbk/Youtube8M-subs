00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.649
 volcanics that entered this area of 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.780
 the capital of argentina despite the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.089
 the national meteorological service is 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.449
 indicating the criterion is already clear 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.800
 it feels the ash that the clouds fall 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.750
 in the sky as if they were nines that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.440
 they are just covering this contact 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.489
 with the sun is estimated according to own

 to quickly move through the area of ​​the 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.280
 capital of argentina that are between 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.129
 3000 and 5000 meters high but more 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.500
 Beyond that, you feel and there is a certain 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.449
 annoyance in what it is when one swallows 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.840
 the burning in the throat some discomfort 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.280
 also in the eyes it is not toxic those 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.259
 analyzed the authorities and this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 perspective the conference is 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.880
 developing with the curiosity of the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.189
 cloud that will quickly pass through the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.610
 winds that are coming from the south west 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.920
 to the north is that crossing 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.810
 practically the entire central region of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.950
 the Argentine Republic has also been 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.049
 informed they say 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.240
 in the province of mendoza in the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.539
 Province of San Luis and this is going to happen 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 without any novelty by the versions 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:47.030
 part dulko surely quickly by 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 the circulation of ash by the hard the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.939
 own health having already indicated them

 what happens with the album that usually remains 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.049
 so there is a framework just in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 difficulties because of the large amount of 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.789
