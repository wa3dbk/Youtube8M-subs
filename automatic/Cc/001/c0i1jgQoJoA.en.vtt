00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
stranded work while catching the yarn

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.430 
stranded work while catching the yarn

be for the purl stitch so start over
again<00:00:20.290> this<00:00:20.710> is<00:00:20.770> my<00:00:21.010> work<00:00:21.250> from<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.550> back<00:00:21.760> side

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
again this is my work from the back side

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.540 
again this is my work from the back side
from<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.570> wrong<00:00:22.750> side<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:23.290> work<00:00:23.439> I've<00:00:24.310> got

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
from the wrong side of the work I've got

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.940 
from the wrong side of the work I've got
my<00:00:24.700> trans<00:00:25.270> caught<00:00:25.720> pretty<00:00:26.080> much<00:00:26.290> every<00:00:26.680> stitch

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
my trans caught pretty much every stitch

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.730 
my trans caught pretty much every stitch
so<00:00:27.490> there's<00:00:27.880> no<00:00:28.119> dangling<00:00:29.020> yarn<00:00:29.259> ends<00:00:29.500> that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
so there's no dangling yarn ends that

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.310 
so there's no dangling yarn ends that
could<00:00:29.890> hang<00:00:30.040> around<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:31.390> picking<00:00:31.810> up<00:00:31.900> my<00:00:32.050> yarn

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
could hang around I'm picking up my yarn

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.229 
could hang around I'm picking up my yarn
again<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.980> way<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.130> always<00:00:33.400> do<00:00:33.730> it<00:00:34.000> doesn't

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
again the way I always do it doesn't

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.050 
again the way I always do it doesn't
matter<00:00:34.480> if<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:34.810> pick<00:00:34.989> it<00:00:35.110> up<00:00:35.230> like<00:00:35.380> this<00:00:35.620> or<00:00:36.060> if

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
matter if you pick it up like this or if

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.120 
matter if you pick it up like this or if
you<00:00:37.270> tend<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.570> pick<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.900> up<00:00:37.989> like<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.410> the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
you tend to pick it up like that the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.680 
you tend to pick it up like that the
most<00:00:39.340> important<00:00:39.820> thing<00:00:39.970> is<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.270> once<00:00:40.510> you've

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
most important thing is that once you've

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.430 
most important thing is that once you've
got<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:40.899> picked<00:00:41.199> up<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:42.550> take<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.809> strand<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
got it picked up you take one strand and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410 
got it picked up you take one strand and
put<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.800> front<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.399> explained<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.390> the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
put it to the front I explained in the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.689 
put it to the front I explained in the
last<00:00:46.480> video<00:00:47.019> for<00:00:47.469> me<00:00:47.590> my<00:00:47.800> main<00:00:48.039> colors<00:00:48.430> on<00:00:48.609> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
last video for me my main colors on the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.900 
last video for me my main colors on the
back<00:00:48.910> my<00:00:49.870> contrast<00:00:50.590> colors<00:00:50.920> on<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> front<00:00:51.399> but

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
back my contrast colors on the front but

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.549 
back my contrast colors on the front but
you<00:00:52.269> can<00:00:52.420> do<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.660> either<00:00:52.780> way<00:00:52.899> whatever<00:00:53.440> you

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
you can do it either way whatever you

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.400 
you can do it either way whatever you
like<00:00:54.149> sometimes<00:00:55.149> people<00:00:55.300> find<00:00:55.809> one<00:00:56.109> stitch

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
like sometimes people find one stitch

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.500 
like sometimes people find one stitch
easier<00:00:56.800> than<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> other<00:00:57.300> working<00:00:58.300> more

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
easier than the other working more

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.840 
easier than the other working more
stitches<00:00:58.960> with<00:00:59.109> one<00:00:59.289> color<00:00:59.559> so<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.579> case

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
stitches with one color so in that case

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.910 
stitches with one color so in that case
I<00:01:01.089> recommend<00:01:01.210> taking<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.109> easier<00:01:02.469> color<00:01:02.769> to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
I recommend taking the easier color to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.320 
I recommend taking the easier color to
the<00:01:03.010> front<00:01:03.280> for<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.699> part<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.089> pattern

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the front for the part of the pattern

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.870 
the front for the part of the pattern
you're<00:01:04.570> working<00:01:04.900> on<00:01:05.160> it's<00:01:06.160> easier<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.730> me<00:01:06.850> to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
you're working on it's easier for me to

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.850 
you're working on it's easier for me to
keep<00:01:07.150> track<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.630> colors<00:01:07.960> especially<00:01:08.410> when

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
keep track of colors especially when

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.250 
keep track of colors especially when
they're<00:01:09.010> equal<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.640> similar<00:01:10.000> colors<00:01:10.330> that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
they're equal the similar colors that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.980 
they're equal the similar colors that
you<00:01:11.680> can<00:01:11.860> actually<00:01:12.040> keep<00:01:12.430> them<00:01:12.810> ordered<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:13.930> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
you can actually keep them ordered in a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.080 
you can actually keep them ordered in a
way<00:01:14.110> like<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.040> I've<00:01:15.159> got<00:01:15.340> my<00:01:15.369> yarn<00:01:15.729> taken

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
way like this so I've got my yarn taken

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.120 
way like this so I've got my yarn taken
up<00:01:16.210> now<00:01:16.900> I'm<00:01:16.990> starting<00:01:17.409> on<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.619> first<00:01:17.799> purl

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
up now I'm starting on the first purl

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.969 
up now I'm starting on the first purl
stitch<00:01:18.400> by<00:01:18.850> twisting<00:01:19.329> here<00:01:19.450> once<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.770> white

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
stitch by twisting here once the white

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.190 
stitch by twisting here once the white
yarn<00:01:21.220> is<00:01:21.460> gonna<00:01:21.610> be<00:01:21.759> caught<00:01:21.970> on<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.180> edge<00:01:22.390> so

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
yarn is gonna be caught on the edge so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.560 
yarn is gonna be caught on the edge so
I'm<00:01:23.320> knitting<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.890> stitch<00:01:24.250> now<00:01:25.119> comes<00:01:25.390> my

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
I'm knitting this stitch now comes my

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.179 
I'm knitting this stitch now comes my
second<00:01:25.930> stitch<00:01:26.140> purling<00:01:26.649> is<00:01:26.770> more<00:01:26.979> difficult

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
second stitch purling is more difficult

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.660 
second stitch purling is more difficult
I<00:01:27.700> take<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.420> finger<00:01:28.720> here<00:01:29.049> pull<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.130> down<00:01:30.340> and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
I take this finger here pull it down and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.590 
I take this finger here pull it down and
then<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.619> put<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:32.979> one<00:01:33.220> through<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
then you can put this one through and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.389 
then you can put this one through and
now<00:01:34.899> from<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.259> top<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.530> hope<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:35.979> out<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
now from the top I hope this out of the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.389 
now from the top I hope this out of the
way<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.210> work<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.600> stitch<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.860> now<00:01:39.100> again

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
way and I work this stitch and now again

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.800 
way and I work this stitch and now again
this<00:01:39.640> out<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.210> way<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.200> through<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.880> yet

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
this out of the way and through and yet

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.700 
this out of the way and through and yet
again<00:01:43.960> like<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:46.270> comes<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.899> white<00:01:47.320> stitch

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
again like this now comes a white stitch

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.050 
again like this now comes a white stitch
I<00:01:47.860> can<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:48.189> pull<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.460> through<00:01:48.729> like<00:01:48.880> this

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
I can just pull that through like this

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.230 
I can just pull that through like this
and<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:50.110> few<00:01:50.290> more<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.740> black<00:01:50.950> ones<00:01:51.250> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.310 

through<00:01:55.240> here

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 

so<00:01:58.860> after<00:01:59.100> these<00:01:59.220> three<00:01:59.490> stitches<00:01:59.760> there's<00:02:00.330> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
in between here and now this way around

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:26.740 
in between here and now this way around
and<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:19.080> way<00:02:19.290> around<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:20.930> black<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:25.190> two

and this way around a black one one two

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.640 
and this way around a black one one two
three<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.790> another<00:02:30.000> black<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.650> and

three and you have another black one and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.920 
three and you have another black one and
one<00:02:34.610> two<00:02:35.610> three<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:39.090> doesn't<00:02:39.390> matter<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
one two three it doesn't matter if you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.070 
one two three it doesn't matter if you
actually<00:02:40.140> start<00:02:40.980> from<00:02:41.310> above<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:41.910> below<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
actually start from above or below you

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.170 
actually start from above or below you
can<00:02:43.110> work<00:02:43.410> yourself<00:02:43.530> into<00:02:44.100> your<00:02:44.850> own<00:02:44.970> rhythm

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
can work yourself into your own rhythm

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.720 
can work yourself into your own rhythm
or<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.990> try<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.310> something<00:02:47.580> different

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
or you can try to do something different

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.600 
or you can try to do something different
every<00:02:48.270> time<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.780> mix<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.980> not<00:02:50.250> really

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
every time to mix it up it's not really

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.330 
every time to mix it up it's not really
that<00:02:50.640> important<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.890> important<00:02:53.310> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that important it's just important that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.330 
that important it's just important that
you<00:02:53.610> alternate<00:02:54.090> above<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.170> below<00:02:55.440> every<00:02:56.100> time

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
you alternate above and below every time

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.050 
you alternate above and below every time
like<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.390> easier<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> take<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.020> below<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
like it's easier to take it below and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.620 
like it's easier to take it below and
then<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> black<00:03:01.200> one<00:03:01.470> again<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.630> get

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
then you do a black one again and get

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.750 
then you do a black one again and get
the<00:03:03.660> white<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> way<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the white one out of the way to the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.090 
the white one out of the way to the
black<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:07.640> black<00:03:08.640> one<00:03:08.880> down<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:10.100> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
black one here black one down here the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.640 
black one here black one down here the
white<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> way<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.959> catch<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
white out of the way not catch it on the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.220 
white out of the way not catch it on the
needle<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.130> pull<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.489> through<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:15.140> know<00:03:16.140> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
needle and pull it through I know I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.780 
needle and pull it through I know I
should<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.650> done<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.890> white<00:03:17.100> one<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:17.760> I

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
should have done a white one here but I

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.979 
should have done a white one here but I
just<00:03:17.940> wanted<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> keep<00:03:18.420> showing<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.900> black

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
just wanted to keep showing the black

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.130 
just wanted to keep showing the black
ones<00:03:19.519> no<00:03:20.519> problem<00:03:21.030> pull<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.660> through

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
ones no problem pull it through

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.560 
ones no problem pull it through
as<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.980> said<00:03:23.220> knit<00:03:23.459> stitches<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.940> easier<00:03:24.269> but

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
as I said knit stitches are easier but

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.750 
as I said knit stitches are easier but
if<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.590> want<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.830> do<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> pearls<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.519> this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
if you want to do the pearls like this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.120 
if you want to do the pearls like this
you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.380> neck<00:03:28.560> warmer<00:03:28.769> has<00:03:29.100> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
you can do that the neck warmer has a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.490 
you can do that the neck warmer has a
nice<00:03:29.340> treat<00:03:29.730> here<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.750> since<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.140> was<00:03:31.260> worked

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
nice treat here that since it was worked

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440 
nice treat here that since it was worked
on<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.769> round<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.340> had<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:32.970> knit<00:03:33.209> stitches

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
on the round I had to do knit stitches

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.860 
on the round I had to do knit stitches
only<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.410> work<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.860> lot<00:03:35.100> faster<00:03:35.570> but<00:03:36.570> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
only so this work was a lot faster but I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.960 
only so this work was a lot faster but I
just<00:03:37.440> wanted<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.769> show<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.100> second<00:03:38.459> side<00:03:38.670> in

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
just wanted to show the second side in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.130 
just wanted to show the second side in
case<00:03:39.120> you're<00:03:39.330> doing<00:03:39.510> something<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:39.930> these

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
case you're doing something like these

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.720 
case you're doing something like these
wrist<00:03:40.410> warmers<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> have<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.280> work<00:03:41.430> flat

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
wrist warmers but you have to work flat

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.420 
wrist warmers but you have to work flat
because<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:43.050> need<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
because then you really need to go and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.870 
because then you really need to go and
twist<00:03:44.670> them<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.060> purl<00:03:45.239> side<00:03:45.480> too
