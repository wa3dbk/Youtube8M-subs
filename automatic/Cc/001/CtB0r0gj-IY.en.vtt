00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
overlay and as you can see it starts to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.999 
overlay and as you can see it starts to
show<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> wall<00:01:34.829> behind

show a little bit of the the wall behind
it<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:38.100> honestly<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.329> way<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it but honestly the way the way it is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
it but honestly the way the way it is
right<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.229> looks<00:01:40.259> too<00:01:41.100> unnatural<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
right now it looks too unnatural it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
right now it looks too unnatural it
looks<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> picture<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.799> plastered

and<00:02:03.509> flow<00:02:03.990> around<00:02:04.350> 65<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.479> just

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and flow around 65 and then you're just

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
and flow around 65 and then you're just
going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> select<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.770> layer<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
going to want to select the layer of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
going to want to select the layer of
your<00:02:08.459> image<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> brush<00:02:09.509> around<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.170> sides<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
your image and brush around the sides of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.910 
your image and brush around the sides of
this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
this

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.460 
this
to<00:02:11.300> blend<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> edges<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> picture

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to blend in the edges of the picture

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
to blend in the edges of the picture
into<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.010> wall<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.550> more<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.150> I'll

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
into the wall a little bit more so I'll

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:37.940 
into the wall a little bit more so I'll
go<00:02:15.870> ahead<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740 

as<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.090> already<00:02:39.270> starting<00:02:39.390> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
as you can see it's already starting to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.979 
as you can see it's already starting to
look<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.020> little<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:41.280> better<00:02:44.569> if<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.690> want<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
look a little bit better if you want to

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.559 
look a little bit better if you want to
get<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> smaller<00:02:46.500> brush<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.269> handle<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.360> top

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
get a smaller brush and handle the top

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.820 
get a smaller brush and handle the top
and<00:02:48.720> bottom<00:02:48.870> area<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.709> as<00:02:50.569> bright<00:02:51.569> as

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and bottom area so it's not as bright as

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.410 
and bottom area so it's not as bright as
the<00:02:52.830> edges<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.640> might<00:02:53.790> look<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.269> bit

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the edges it might look a little bit

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.699 
the edges it might look a little bit
more<00:02:54.510> natural<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.110> i'll<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.319> ahead<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.500> leave

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
more natural but i'll go ahead and leave

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.330 
more natural but i'll go ahead and leave
it<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> way<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.430> now<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:57.319> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
it the way it is right now and that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.990 
it the way it is right now and that
pretty<00:02:59.340> much<00:02:59.459> does<00:02:59.910> it<00:02:59.970> um<00:03:01.790> depending<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
pretty much does it um depending on the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.500 
pretty much does it um depending on the
picture<00:03:03.360> some<00:03:04.400> some<00:03:05.400> pictures<00:03:05.700> will<00:03:05.910> show<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
picture some some pictures will show the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.820 
picture some some pictures will show the
brick<00:03:06.720> wall<00:03:06.900> behind<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.319> little<00:03:07.470> bit<00:03:07.650> more

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
brick wall behind it a little bit more

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.610 
brick wall behind it a little bit more
or<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.120> case<00:03:09.180> since<00:03:09.660> Jennings<00:03:10.500> is

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
or in this case since Jennings is

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.870 
or in this case since Jennings is
wearing<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.920> white<00:03:11.099> shirt<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.430> there's<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.760> lot

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
wearing a white shirt and there's a lot

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.120 
wearing a white shirt and there's a lot
of<00:03:11.910> white<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.360> picture<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
of white in the picture in the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.120 
of white in the picture in the
background<00:03:14.130> up<00:03:15.030> by<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.630> train<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.980> can

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
background up by the train you can

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.270 
background up by the train you can
actually<00:03:17.400> select<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.819> layer<00:03:18.030> go<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.280> darken

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
actually select this layer go to darken

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.729 
actually select this layer go to darken
and<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:22.910> almost<00:03:23.910> eliminates<00:03:24.840> all<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.590> white

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
and that almost eliminates all the white

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.130 
and that almost eliminates all the white
in<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> picture<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:27.209> shows<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.480> wall

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
in the picture and just shows the wall

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.920 
in the picture and just shows the wall
behind<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.480> little<00:03:30.599> bit<00:03:30.750> more

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
behind it so that's a little bit more

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.600 
behind it so that's a little bit more
personal<00:03:31.349> preference<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.950> might<00:03:32.160> like

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
personal preference so you might like

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.339 
personal preference so you might like
that<00:03:32.849> instead<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:36.200> depending<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
that instead of this depending on the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.229 
that instead of this depending on the
picture<00:03:37.620> though<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.160> said<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:38.940> need

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
picture though like I said you just need

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.720 
picture though like I said you just need
to<00:03:39.360> experiment<00:03:39.900> with<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.230> lot<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.530> these

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
to experiment with a lot of these

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.190 
to experiment with a lot of these
effects<00:03:41.730> over<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.180> depending<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.109> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
effects over here depending on the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.539 
effects over here depending on the
picture<00:03:43.470> some<00:03:43.799> things<00:03:44.130> are<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.459> look

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
picture some things are going to look

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.860 
picture some things are going to look
better<00:03:44.700> some<00:03:45.060> things<00:03:45.239> aren't<00:03:45.389> all<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.630> course

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
better some things aren't all of course

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.680 
better some things aren't all of course
and<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.889> this<00:03:46.980> case<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.609> think<00:03:47.940> dark<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.569> looks

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
and in this case I think dark and looks

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.890 
and in this case I think dark and looks
the<00:03:48.810> best<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.780> like<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the best but if you like that like I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
the best but if you like that like I
said<00:03:52.079> it's<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.260> personal<00:03:52.530> preference<00:03:52.940> so

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
said it's just personal preference so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.000 
said it's just personal preference so
that's<00:03:54.510> how<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.690> do<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.109> graffiti<00:03:55.560> effect<00:03:55.859> in

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that's how you do a graffiti effect in

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.819 
that's how you do a graffiti effect in
Photoshop<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:57.930> any<00:03:58.049> questions<00:03:58.440> feel
