00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
because usually I don't check the dark

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
something some sort of energy blast now

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.219 
something some sort of energy blast now
he<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:38.210> physical<00:01:39.210> attack<00:01:39.479> flame<00:01:39.840> attack

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
he has physical attack flame attack

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.100 
he has physical attack flame attack
metal<00:01:40.740> attack<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> dark<00:01:41.640> attack<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.780> wasn't

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
metal attack and dark attack that wasn't

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.520 
metal attack and dark attack that wasn't
hard<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> guess<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.930> again<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> bottom

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
hard to guess and again the bottom

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
hard to guess and again the bottom
attack<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.549> basic<00:01:48.090> attack<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.750> let's<00:01:48.960> see

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
attack is the basic attack now let's see

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.060 
attack is the basic attack now let's see
alright<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.720> highest<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.440> an<00:01:53.590> increase<00:01:54.040> of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
alright so the highest is an increase of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.750 
alright so the highest is an increase of
44<00:01:54.760> damage<00:01:55.770> forty-four<00:01:56.770> percent<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.430> is

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.130 

well<00:02:00.760> that's<00:02:00.940> replacing<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.660> physical

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
well that's replacing the physical

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.810 
well that's replacing the physical
attack<00:02:02.470> though<00:02:02.740> all<00:02:03.430> right<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.850> um<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.610> best

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
attack though all right so um the best

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.480 
attack though all right so um the best
attack<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:07.900> flamethrower<00:02:08.619> except

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
attack I like is the flamethrower except

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.980 
attack I like is the flamethrower except
he<00:02:09.580> doesn't<00:02:09.700> well<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> guess<00:02:10.480> he<00:02:10.600> does<00:02:10.780> do<00:02:10.960> a

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
he doesn't well I guess he does do a

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.650 
he doesn't well I guess he does do a
flamethrower<00:02:11.320> type<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.370> animation<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.540> we're

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
flamethrower type of animation but we're

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.280 
flamethrower type of animation but we're
gonna<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:13.900> quickly<00:02:14.520> into<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.630> battle<00:02:16.630> stadium

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
gonna go quickly into the battle stadium

so<00:03:05.470> you'll<00:03:06.070> notice<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.459> he's<00:03:06.670> charging<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:07.600> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
so you'll notice I he's charging up the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.229 
so you'll notice I he's charging up the
power<00:03:08.020> before<00:03:08.350> he<00:03:08.680> does<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.400> if<00:03:09.820> we<00:03:09.850> do

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
power before he does that so if we do

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.210 
power before he does that so if we do
get<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.480> chance<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.020> now<00:03:11.350> we<00:03:11.410> don't<00:03:11.590> alright<00:03:12.130> so

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
get a chance of now we don't alright so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.640 
get a chance of now we don't alright so
we're<00:03:12.370> dead<00:03:12.610> but<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.989> rewind<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.620> bit

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
we're dead but if you rewind a bit

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.520 
we're dead but if you rewind a bit
you'll<00:03:15.550> notice<00:03:15.880> he<00:03:16.090> charges<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.959> energy

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you'll notice he charges that energy

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.930 
you'll notice he charges that energy
right<00:03:18.220> into<00:03:18.610> his<00:03:19.060> hands<00:03:19.510> or<00:03:20.700> whatever<00:03:21.700> his

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
right into his hands or whatever his

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.190 
right into his hands or whatever his
palm<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.630> then<00:03:23.320> he<00:03:23.770> blocks<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.690> he

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
palm and then he blocks is it so it he

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.020 
palm and then he blocks is it so it he
doesn't<00:03:26.380> do<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> block<00:03:26.980> immediately<00:03:27.370> he

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
doesn't do a block immediately he

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.260 
doesn't do a block immediately he
charges<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.630> first<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.620> then<00:03:30.430> he<00:03:30.760> does<00:03:31.030> it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
charges it first and then he does it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.750 
charges it first and then he does it
anyways<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.350> was<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.530> pretty<00:03:32.860> cool<00:03:33.160> animation

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
anyways I was a pretty cool animation

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.460 
anyways I was a pretty cool animation
reminds<00:03:34.150> me<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.330> Dragon<00:03:34.600> Ball<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.020> my<00:03:35.140> opinion

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
reminds me of Dragon Ball in my opinion

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.199 
reminds me of Dragon Ball in my opinion
and<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.390> sunset<00:03:38.110> dragon<00:03:38.770> in<00:03:39.209> dragon

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
and that is the sunset dragon in dragon

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.480 
and that is the sunset dragon in dragon
city
