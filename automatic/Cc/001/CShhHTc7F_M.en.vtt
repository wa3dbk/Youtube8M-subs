00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello dear friends with you me and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.910
 reaction of and today on my review 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.490
 online strategies from domestic 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.920
 developers called star wars 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 the game is a mixture 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.219
 economic war strategy where do you 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.350
 to build and develop their 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.439
 space empire as I said 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 the game functions only with active 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.410
 internet connection and by the way requires 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 registration by the way if during registration 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 you specify an invite code gameplay in one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 get a word from a small letter 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 premium second level account for one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.160
 month and also 150 thousand units of dark 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 matter for dark matter you can 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
 hire governors to move the planet 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 and also open drawings of rare 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 objects in the game there is no sensible 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 tutorial so I will try to explain 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 In short, what do you need to do in the game? 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 the initial stage is the first thing to do 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 in the game it is to hire the governor the governor 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 will give you a certain role bonus 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.730
 the governor may be a technologist engineer 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 and forger yourself whom you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 put in the role of governor will 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 determined by the style of your governing and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.110
 stage of development 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 I recommend at the initial stage 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.340
 by the governor of the engineer as this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.220
 will increase the speed of construction of buildings anya in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 governor need to start mining resources 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.049
 resources in the game are divided into four types 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.390
 this is metal deuterium crystals and energy 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.060
 for each type of resource has its own type 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.189
 built but worth remembering every object 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 mining requires energy 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.200
 so take care of the power station 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.900
 fully ensure the prey you 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360
 probably there was a question at the beginning of resources 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.880
 you have very few 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 normal development so here's the resources you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 can still get for doing 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 quests quests are to build 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 objects of a certain level you 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 get a reward for 1 10 15 and so on 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 the level of each building 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 This fact greatly facilitates 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.430
 the development of their planet therefore 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.009
 it is advisable to focus on start like 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.229
 once on the construction of each object they 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.600
 pump over one type of buildings 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.850
 after the construction of the shipyard you can build 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 your space fleet it could be 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.170
 military and transport ships 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.509
 there are more than 40 types in the game 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.640
 space ships ships to the word will 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.710
 not immediately available to build them 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.780
 take right 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.280
 some studies to conduct 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
 which way you need to build 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.840
 laboratory besides creating a fleet and 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.060
 resource extraction needs to be ensured and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.350
 the security of the planet for this on its 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 the planet needs to be placed 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.880
 defensive structure which also 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.040
 present in the game after you 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.320
 break up will become another question you need 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.570
 will expand the boundaries of his empire 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.490
 colonize other planets and enter 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.730
 into alliances and trade with others 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.410
 by the players and this is exactly 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.900
 the main interest of the game for your 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.120
 class strategy turned out quite good 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.220
 and I think lovers of such strategies and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 unequivocally appreciated for those who first 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 play a similar strategy note that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.460
 each action will take a certain 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 the amount of time therefore more 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.720
 later stages you can enter the game 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.910
 about know the orders and return to it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 a little later when all the work will be 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 completed thanks to this game not 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.340
 takes you a lot of time 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 but, no less, it will delay for a long time 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420
