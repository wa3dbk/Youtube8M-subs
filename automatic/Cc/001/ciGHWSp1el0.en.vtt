a<00:02:25.620> match<00:02:25.890> at<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> bigger<00:02:27.720> issue

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
a match at all I think the bigger issue

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
a match at all I think the bigger issue
is<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.800> play<00:02:29.040> games<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is that we just want to play games and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.100 
is that we just want to play games and
having<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.910> wait<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> ridiculous<00:02:30.660> long<00:02:30.840> amount

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
having to wait a ridiculous long amount

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.260 
having to wait a ridiculous long amount
of<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.280> quality<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> games<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.209> a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
of time for the quality of games is a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390 
of time for the quality of games is a
problem<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.080> course<00:02:34.319> an<00:02:34.530> option<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
problem of course an option would be the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.010 
problem of course an option would be the
best<00:02:35.610> bet<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> game<00:02:36.360> does<00:02:36.600> not<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:36.930> an

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
best bet but the game does not have an

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.650 
best bet but the game does not have an
option<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> search<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.130> all<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.700> searched<00:02:39.390> for

option to search for all or searched for

option to search for all or searched for
similar<00:02:40.050> rank<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.040> does<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.520> does<00:02:41.670> kind<00:02:41.940> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
similar rank so it does it does kind of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.430 
similar rank so it does it does kind of
suck<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.450> hope<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.020> gets<00:02:43.230> fixed

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
suck I do hope that this gets fixed

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.110 
suck I do hope that this gets fixed
immediately<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.790> want<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> play

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
immediately because we just want to play

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.509 
immediately because we just want to play
more<00:02:45.360> ranked<00:02:45.690> matches<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.470> point<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.950> I

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
more ranked matches at this point and I

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.120 
more ranked matches at this point and I
hope<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.840> leniency<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.739> someone

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
hope that the the leniency of someone

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.300 
hope that the the leniency of someone
similar<00:02:50.670> rank<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.390> six<00:02:51.780> levels<00:02:52.019> ahead<00:02:52.860> or

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
similar rank is like six levels ahead or

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.040 
similar rank is like six levels ahead or
below<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.330> pretty<00:02:54.510> fair<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
below you I think that's pretty fair and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
below you I think that's pretty fair and
it<00:02:55.500> should<00:02:55.650> search<00:02:55.860> for<00:02:55.890> people<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.550> are<00:02:56.670> not

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
it should search for people that are not

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.070 
it should search for people that are not
within<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.239> same<00:02:57.420> rank<00:02:57.630> after<00:02:57.780> like

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
within the same rank after like

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.410 
within the same rank after like
literally<00:02:58.380> 15<00:02:58.950> seconds<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.489> think<00:02:59.790> 15<00:02:59.910> seconds

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
literally 15 seconds I think 15 seconds

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.270 
literally 15 seconds I think 15 seconds
is<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> long<00:03:00.600> enough<00:03:00.989> search<00:03:01.170> period<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.040> try<00:03:02.220> to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
is a long enough search period to try to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.729 
is a long enough search period to try to
open<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.760> up<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:03.000> anybody<00:03:03.360> possible<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.260> your

open it up to anybody possible and your

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
some situations and we do hope this

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.550 
some situations and we do hope this
stuff<00:04:03.000> gets<00:04:03.239> fixed<00:04:03.570> outside<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.019> some<00:04:04.260> audio

issues<00:04:04.950> as<00:04:05.100> well<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.549> turns<00:04:06.359> out<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.600> we've

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
issues as well and turns out that we've

been reporting a lot of this stuff to
double<00:04:08.459> helix<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.850> they<00:04:08.940> are<00:04:09.120> actually<00:04:09.540> aware

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
double helix and they are actually aware

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.590 
double helix and they are actually aware
so<00:04:10.650> what's<00:04:11.340> good<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.850> this<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.209> an<00:04:12.329> update
