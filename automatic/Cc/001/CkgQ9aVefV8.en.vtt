00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.429
 who's called oki and who will you 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 allow to send and receive very 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.660
 quickly sms so from the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.770
 notifications center by dragging a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 blow down you make appear 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
 this quick dial window or 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 there you will be able to search among 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.810
 your repertoire the person to whom you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 want to write and then enter here in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.170
 the text field the message you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.610
 want to send right next 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.230
 the little camera icon we 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 allows to select one for example 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 here the last one you see she's 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.239
 automatically added to my message I 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 can then send it like that really 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.989
 very quickly and very easily 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 so that's how it works either 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.020
 you go directly through the center 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.610
 notifications to slip a shot 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.649
 down and display this window of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 quick composition sure you go in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.579
 the settings of your device set 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 an active gesture wrong so that you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.670
 will write even more 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 quickly without necessarily going through the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 notifications center you'll have 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 just to perform your gesture mine the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.120
 here is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 I chose support course on the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 volume button or what's so I'm you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 watch it look up I press the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 volume button and there the window of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760
 fast composition appears so that me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
 allows to write a message really 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 super fast and that since 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.189
 where I wanted to show on the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.049
 springboard but it will work too 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.670
 on the lock screen or at 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.590
 inside apps look 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.530
 it's really excellent you can 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.430
 very quickly write your sms 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 now let's admit you're in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 an application you are navigating you 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 receive a sms look at this little button 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
 which is displayed here by tapping 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.220
 you display what is called the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 quick response window that will you 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 to answer your SMS without 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740
 leave the application in which you 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.450
 you find 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.009
 then another feature of the tweak if 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.390
 you never receive many messages to 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.189
 following a same person and that you 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 rather want to be quiet well 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.399
 you can slide to the left on 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.049
 the conversation to reveal this button 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.360
 here that serves you to put the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.740
 conversation in silence you can 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.450
 do that for any of your 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
 contacts put the conversation into 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.840
 silencer by pressing this little 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 button here at that moment the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.229
 conversation getting scarred grid you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 always receive messages but more 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.920
 notifications to disable the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.239
 mode it's simple you redo them 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 same gestures you press the button 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.069
 and at that moment 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.110
 you will receive them again 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.910
 notifications so all thanks to this 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.010
 tweak cydia who like these 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.349
 available on the bigboss source at 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.209
 price of 4 dollars so it may seem 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.950
 a little expensive for a tweak without adjustment 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.110
 is currently only compatible 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 with iphone and ipod touch but it takes 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.130
 to admit that he is really beautiful 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.450
 perfectly integrated with ios is on 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.489
 could believe that it's apple that has it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.680
 proposed with its magnificent window of 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.910
 response and quick dial and 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.260
 besides the tweak also works 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.230
 well in portrait mode in landscape mode 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 look here so anyway here 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.069
 how it works it could be 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.750
 an alternative to the very famous byte sms 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.340
 so tell me what you thought 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.810
 all this in the comments 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.640
 and I tell you very soon for 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.640
