okay so here we are about seven hours
into<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.610> cook<00:04:07.080> it's<00:04:08.080> got<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.260> nice<00:04:08.440> thick<00:04:08.500> bark

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
into the cook it's got a nice thick bark

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.809 
into the cook it's got a nice thick bark
on<00:04:09.310> it

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:21.189 

keep<00:04:12.819> them<00:04:12.970> coals<00:04:13.269> down<00:04:14.010> low<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.220> slow

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.260 

looks<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:21.979> she's<00:04:22.189> rolling<00:04:22.490> pretty<00:04:22.699> good<00:04:25.270> so

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
looks like she's rolling pretty good so

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.140 
looks like she's rolling pretty good so
I<00:04:26.300> think<00:04:26.419> we'll<00:04:26.719> wrap<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.289> foil<00:04:28.060> give<00:04:29.060> it

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
I think we'll wrap it in foil give it

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.779 
I think we'll wrap it in foil give it
about<00:04:29.240> another<00:04:29.360> three<00:04:29.960> hours<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.789> then

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
about another three hours and then

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.450 
about another three hours and then
unwrap<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.389> foil<00:04:32.629> and<00:04:33.189> get<00:04:34.189> the<00:04:34.250> heat<00:04:34.430> up

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
unwrap the foil and get the heat up

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.749 
unwrap the foil and get the heat up
there<00:04:35.210> nice<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.539> crispy<00:04:35.810> on<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:35.960> outside
