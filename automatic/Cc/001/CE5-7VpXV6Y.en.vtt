00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.360
 Hey you 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:25.030

 I wonder was it found, Well many things that 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:07.169
 For the audience who can not keep up with the game here, the game is a superb collection of materials 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.169
 It is on the way back to the meetinghouse 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.480
 Is it okay to cross the front of the request like this ? 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.420
 Yup 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.969
 Maybe there is no sign of being attacked at all 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.600
 All right 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.070
 It does not seem to be 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.250
 A little 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.590
 There are quite a few good numbers. 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.340

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:35.010

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.160
 I'm feeling down 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:16.169
 It seemed as if materials were finally gathered 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:21.129
 Get the mind that important that there is lyrics Reimu is not enough 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:24.760

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:27.180
