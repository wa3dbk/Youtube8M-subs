00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.290 
just to practice it and obviously do
that<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.650> multiple<00:01:44.980> places<00:01:45.100> not<00:01:45.760> just<00:01:46.060> on<00:01:46.210> your

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
that in multiple places not just on your

highest<00:01:46.660> string<00:01:46.900> do<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.440> same<00:01:47.650> thing

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.940 

different<00:01:53.050> places<00:01:53.230> all<00:01:53.500> throughout<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
different places all throughout the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.220 
different places all throughout the
instrument<00:01:54.370> high-low<00:01:55.060> whatever<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:55.990> kind

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
instrument high-low whatever just kind

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.320 
instrument high-low whatever just kind
of<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.440> used<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.730> then<00:01:57.850> another<00:01:58.120> thing

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
of get used to it and then another thing

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.450 
of get used to it and then another thing
that<00:01:58.390> we<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.660> start<00:01:58.900> doing<00:01:59.050> obviously<00:01:59.620> is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
that we can start doing obviously is

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.320 
that we can start doing obviously is
take<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.970> beyond<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.540> idea<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:02.080> being<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:04.030> a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
take it beyond the idea of being just a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.140 
take it beyond the idea of being just a
trill<00:02:04.960> between<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.920> note<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.580> whole<00:02:06.730> step<00:02:06.970> or

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
trill between a note and a whole step or

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.330 
trill between a note and a whole step or
a<00:02:07.180> half<00:02:07.330> step<00:02:07.600> above<00:02:07.630> what<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.619> do<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.980> is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
a half step above what I can do is is

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.730 
a half step above what I can do is is
split<00:02:09.790> up<00:02:09.820> my<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.780> hands<00:02:11.140> through<00:02:11.440> different

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
split up my my hands through different

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
split up my my hands through different
parts<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.100> neck<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.580> turn<00:02:13.300> these<00:02:13.450> into

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
parts of the neck and turn these into

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.440 
parts of the neck and turn these into
chords<00:02:14.140> I'll<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:14.380> ahead<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.800> I'll<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.670> let's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
chords I'll go ahead and I'll do a let's

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.510 
chords I'll go ahead and I'll do a let's
see<00:02:16.600> where<00:02:16.750> am<00:02:16.780> i<00:02:16.960> I'll<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.740> as<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> D<00:02:18.220> minor

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
see where am i I'll do this as a D minor

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240 
see where am i I'll do this as a D minor
triad<00:02:19.150> right<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.840> have<00:02:20.050> my<00:02:20.380> my<00:02:20.950> index

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
triad right so I can have my my index

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.100 
the the a with over here on the 14th
fret<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.459> basically<00:02:33.850> I'll<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.540> sound

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
fret so basically I'll have this sound

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.449 
fret so basically I'll have this sound
happening

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:48.750 

speed<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.510> up<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:45.870> tapping<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.459> d-minor<00:02:48.459> try

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
speed that up I'm tapping a d-minor try

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.849 
speed that up I'm tapping a d-minor try
it<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.359> same<00:02:49.599> as<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.230> was<00:02:50.409> it's<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
it it's the same as if I was it's the

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.140 
it it's the same as if I was it's the
same<00:02:51.040> technique<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.489> if<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:51.879> doing<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
same technique as if I was doing the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.420 
same technique as if I was doing the
trill<00:02:52.420> round<00:02:52.989> going<00:02:53.260> left<00:02:56.129> but<00:02:57.129> it<00:02:57.219> sounds

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
trill round going left but it sounds

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.559 
trill round going left but it sounds
really<00:02:57.609> cool<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.879> you<00:02:57.969> can<00:02:58.090> work<00:02:58.239> your<00:02:58.389> way

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
really cool so you can work your way

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:11.720 
really cool so you can work your way
through<00:03:05.639> that<00:03:06.639> time<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:06.909> move<00:03:07.120> my<00:03:07.329> right<00:03:07.510> hand

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.350 

I<00:03:16.040> ran<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.190> notes<00:03:17.489> but<00:03:17.970> either<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.299> you

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
I ran out of notes but either way you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.820 
I ran out of notes but either way you
get<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.599> idea<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.349> kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.590> take

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
get the idea so you can kind of take

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740 
get the idea so you can kind of take
that<00:03:20.069> pattern<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.819> going<00:03:21.030> left<00:03:21.269> pull<00:03:21.569> off

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that pattern of going left pull off

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.270 
that pattern of going left pull off
right<00:03:21.930> pull<00:03:22.290> off<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:22.799> back<00:03:22.920> and

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
right pull off and just going back and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.979 
right pull off and just going back and
forth<00:03:23.489> between<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.879> two<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.480> create<00:03:24.780> some

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
forth between the two to create some

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.410 
forth between the two to create some
really<00:03:25.260> cool<00:03:25.519> chord<00:03:26.519> sequences<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> tap

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
really cool chord sequences to tap

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.270 
really cool chord sequences to tap
through<00:03:27.750> or<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.319> also<00:03:28.440> makes<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.860> really<00:03:29.099> cool

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
through or it also makes a really cool

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.119 
through or it also makes a really cool
ending<00:03:29.760> when<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> finish<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.260> tune

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129

drilling back and forth between three
fingers<00:03:50.219> basically<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.969> it's<00:03:51.359> kind<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.599> like
