 today we have this possibility to perform a blanket very easily 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.619
 polar 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 let's work with the machine 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.390
 what 20m do you do a line schedule machine none 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 we are going to work on this opportunity 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.930
 three centuries on schedule 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.030
 We are going to make a three-thread finish for the whole contour of our 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.380
 garments 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.390
 escort opportunities work with polar 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.180
 let's close good is that they gave me the machine 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.050
 we close 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 and we are going to work 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.240
 all the contour 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 we go down to the foot 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.390
 good in this way 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.540
 permínov 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.000
 by the sides of our blanket 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.980
 once we finish the laterals 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.430
 I already decided 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 with the task as they admitted 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.270
 I took a piece of cloth 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.100
 I was left if you remember we had worked this same design 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 when we made a palm where a participle is counted 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.660
 of the year 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.600
 I took the same figure 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 which the slug 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.500
 located in the sector of our blankets that we like 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 we are going to fix it with some pins 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.650
 let's double 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.050
 all this sector inwards 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.910
 and we are going to fix them with some pins is at this step I have him in advance 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 I will show you 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.970
 fixed in the center of this blanket 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.220
 we would 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.560
 here you will make a point of your yamaha fiat no 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.480
 It is a sewing portal that allows us to go to relax 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.679
 without restricting 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.339
 we will work the same with the same or in the three-wire subscription to drown it nothing 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.779
 more than we're going to change the tensions 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.819
 in the blue book we are going to place a tension 0 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.409
 in the green book we will place a tension four and a half come and not red 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.179
 a tension 7 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.019
 in this way we will be able to make a position 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.779
 what are we going to be able to stretch 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:37.590
 manna 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.729
 work doubling 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.879
 on the side 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.829
 we want adjusted with pins 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.079
 they are going to bend 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 We will work singapore china in the machine 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.400
 we raise our foot press télam 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 and place below 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.340
 this way we will work 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.779
 all the lateral 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.779
 we went down on foot 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.479
 and we will not go making 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.829
 in this way 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.829
 let's go adrid and seam 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.249
 stretch 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.949
 and on the other side 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.949
 we have the internal part left 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.930
 well in this way we do all the appliqués 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.659
 we have only worked with the machine the 20 20 we do not use affects 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.479
 This way you can solve 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.819
 very easy to make a very easy way to make this blanket I hope 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.649
 who use it to carry out this work generally cepes and at par 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:54.909
 work with polar 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.810
 so invite them to foresee this type of sewing that they have to have 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:59.789
 machine 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.389
 the chemistry also not to forget 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.520
 between March 4 and 5 and 6 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.440
 in net pasta found the maxi cofe emits is that it is an exhibition of 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.550
 sewing machines and whatever textile industry we are going to participate is 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.709
 there are also 4 48 goals same makeup 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.459
 so it is that they are walking through Buenos Aires and they want to visit us 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.210
 we wait 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.110
 remember that we counted which among training and advice any 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.110
 doubt that they have regarding this machine several other 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.340
 we also have 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.690

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.169
