to<00:02:28.190> delay<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:28.970> period<00:02:29.210> because<00:02:29.960> my<00:02:30.410> period<00:02:30.890> was

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
to delay my period because my period was

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.560 
to delay my period because my period was
going<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.490> be<00:02:31.640> right<00:02:32.060> then<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.510> doctor<00:02:35.510> at

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
going to be right then so the doctor at

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.930 
going to be right then so the doctor at
the<00:02:35.750> swim<00:02:36.020> team<00:02:36.260> said<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.740> think<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.400> better<00:02:37.580> give

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
the swim team said I think I better give

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.080 
the swim team said I think I better give
you<00:02:38.120> an<00:02:38.240> injection<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:39.200> delay<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.160> that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
you an injection to delay it and that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.449 
you an injection to delay it and that
was<00:02:41.270> probably<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.020> worst<00:02:42.200> thing<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.100> do

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
was probably the worst thing to do

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.460 
was probably the worst thing to do
because<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.830> felt<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:46.030> we'd<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.330> 500<00:02:48.140> pound
