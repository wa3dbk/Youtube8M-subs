 It is as to say to sour I also again many times the song is for a long time Cannon 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 There are a lot of users, and a lot of users 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.030
 There are two but there are two 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.469
 Sound is quite good Japan 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.370
 I also'm thought that want to go hard in a place called viewer's is not 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.450
 But 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.190
 This time is it 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.060
 Whether and also because whether not it good to say that dig products Well glance dig products 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.130
 I think it 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:01:00.200
 I would like to MakiRina's to introduce does not take anymore I permitted 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.330
 We will introduce unchanged phase and the fact that we will also introduce forced to comment 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.470
 I'd have let me comment 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:11.010
 Mr. Miri is me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.310
 In particular, is it that film in the way that Rassharu also doing really detail that statistics camera many times 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 You seem to be familiar with cameras from the age 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.159
 Based on the manual focus , I enjoy taking pictures of the camera 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.600
 Well 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 Will take a good photo-in static grams What might it all means everyone registered 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 I would like to try it but it has some taste 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.200
 It is old time that is not in the lens on the market today 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.159
 We have something for this good lens so please take a look at everyone 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.590
 It is I think 8 So hope to be the future also support 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.609
 I say whether I will what was introduce today 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:53.229
 I think I would like to talk about two in fact the other day 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:02:01.179
 It is that 247 residences, and sale was postponed to the original year 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:04.580
 What was said to be released on the 27th of August was postponed to October 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:10.130
 I think I'm very sorry because I 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:14.030
 Also at the time of the Nikon service center that I mentioned the video the other day 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.950
 I asked about two things that I thought 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 Take a video I come with you I to say about it and Na or can be shared 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.230
 Actually, I took a picture at Narita Airport the other day , and it's an 80400 bead, but here 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.190
 I think there are various switches attached 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.690
 These days, the zoom lens has various switches like this. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:45.319
 First, the story of vr a little, but I think that you will be on crime prevention 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:50.220
 First of all, I would like to talk a little about the fabric of this m's ma m child 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.819
 I think from a long time I did not understand looking at private instruction 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.450
 Hmm 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:59.189
 Also am and rem 8 m 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 Of course, there is a switch to disable autofocus completely in the mt manual 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.770
 but 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.510
 I've heard what am and ma are 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.660
 I understand if you look at the total, but 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:17.260
 Well this manual focus is here 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:22.300
 We will continue to talk you into first premise that priority is given to more of the character of the head first to have come 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:28.330
 a of am is short, it is a auto-focus of a auto auto 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.680
 I mainly use the opening style that I think will mean the focus priority manual 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.819
 I occasionally stabbed a solo here 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:40.440
 It will be the mode of the one who is not 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:47.280
 This is to impose a manual focus postal administration man 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:51.540
 I think that is the right manual I often use but I also use autofocus 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 That after using their I manual focus is Toka'll go by hand first to fit the hand 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:00.460
 When that kana do not know do not fit a little Te Those who auto last week 8 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:07.450
 Talk in the wind that I want the kind of form It is a side mode what a big difference 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:09.580
 If you do ama camera car both can use autofocus 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.240
 To the 4 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.080
 Or by the way it is thumb video 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:24.460
 I agree with both boat arson numbers 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:29.169
 It is said that the reaction speed of rotating this ring after being combined with Bibi is different ma 2 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.110
 If you put the switch together, it's autofocus 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.960
 When you turn the ring 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 day 5 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.330
 I understand that the response of the 8 lens is quick , though 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:47.270
 I also tried this, but I do not know clearly 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:52.810
 In and ask at Shinjuku service's Japan production + Japan of more pages to your inquiry to the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:55.249
 I got an answer, but it is basically that it is the reaction speed 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.750
 Turn this ring 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:01.030
 When it touched here after there was a full 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.249
 Version of this 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.090
 That 's right 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:09.830
 Say immediately switched to manual 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.400
 It is a difference of Kubo of the switch that whether such than 7 days auto focus than manual 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.150
 That's right 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.340
 The story of autofocus manual focus is around here 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.940
 Next this vr This vr is a well-known camera shake correction 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.680
 But 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.110
 There is a thing called active and sports mode hit by a lens of normal Constitution 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.020
 so 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:34.060
 If say is basically to promote the sport mode to the panning 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.389
 I do not have a sport mode, but also 80 400 of the box 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.969
 72 but f 2.8 vr 2 places 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:45.709
 It has been the question with respect to the lens on the 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.060
 Use this normal active normal bar when taking a pan shot 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.280
 Why selfish 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.950
 Sink road 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:58.020
 The normal of the movie is included in the normal 6th 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:03.720
 It seems that this lens will automatically reply when you set it. 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:05.070
 It 's a lens that has a vr so it works. 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.529
 Needs a normal 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.340
 What kind of captive is what to do 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:18.460
 The other it is Toka when their own is running extremely say 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:23.260
 It seems that it is used at such a time that it is taken in the place where the law is taken violently 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.620
 In is not active for Tteyuu if it is the panning normal 1 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.810
 Seems necessary 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.380
 Automatically and 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.510
 Fun to righteousness 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.050
 Vr distribution suitable for people to choose to detect the panning length 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.560
 Such a 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.370
 Please try setting 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.090
 I little I got I am allowed to talk about many things I today also want to be around here 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.490
 I think 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.490
 Single polite horse was there happens to channel 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 Hmm 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.750
 Hmm 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.750
 voodoo 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.580
 Hmm 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.169
 me 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.169
 I am 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.169
 tee
