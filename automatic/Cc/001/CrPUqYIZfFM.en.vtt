go really well together so you can see I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
go really well together so you can see I
have<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.729> yellow<00:01:18.000> flowers<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.200> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
pink red flowers and then my orange I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.850 
pink red flowers and then my orange I
think<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> only<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:24.110> one<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.439> half<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
think I only do about one and a half of
