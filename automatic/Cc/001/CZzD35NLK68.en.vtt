Guitar<00:00:05.730> Hero<00:00:06.029> live<00:00:06.629> thing<00:00:07.410> that's<00:00:07.589> been

Guitar Hero live thing that's been

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.799 
Guitar Hero live thing that's been
happening<00:00:07.919> recently<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:09.480> quite

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
happening recently and I'm quite

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.390 
happening recently and I'm quite
interested<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.530> both<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.920> them<00:00:11.040> though<00:00:11.219> I'm

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
interested in both of them though I'm

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.249 
interested in both of them though I'm
kind<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.880> confused<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.660> fact<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.019> they

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
kind of confused on the fact that they

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.379 
kind of confused on the fact that they
were<00:00:13.320> both<00:00:13.530> companies<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.610> were<00:00:14.849> kind<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
were both companies that were kind of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.769 
were both companies that were kind of
shut<00:00:15.660> down<00:00:15.839> because<00:00:16.139> people<00:00:16.680> lost<00:00:16.859> interest

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
shut down because people lost interest

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.450 
shut down because people lost interest
though<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.810> guess<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.410> has<00:00:19.590> been<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:20.010> three

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
though I guess it has been about three

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.310 
though I guess it has been about three
years<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.240> maybe<00:00:21.359> interest<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> piqued

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
years now so maybe interest is piqued

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
years now so maybe interest is piqued
again<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> interesting<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
again and it's kind of interesting to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
again and it's kind of interesting to
see<00:00:24.750> how<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.289> companies<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.920> around

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
see how the companies are going around

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
see how the companies are going around
it<00:00:26.519> again<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.029> time<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.599> seems<00:00:27.840> more<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it again this time it seems more that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
it again this time it seems more that
they're<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> basing<00:00:29.970> their<00:00:30.420> games

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and four and five and then they were all

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
and four and five and then they were all
for<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.450> console<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.200> seems<00:00:46.710> now

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
for like the same console it seems now

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.220 
for like the same console it seems now
that<00:00:46.950> they're<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.820> making<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.930> game

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that they're going to be making one game

that they're going to be making one game
for<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.829> specific<00:00:50.160> generation<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> then

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
for that specific generation and then

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
for that specific generation and then
probably<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> next<00:00:52.649> generation<00:00:53.250> comes

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
probably when the next generation comes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
probably when the next generation comes
out<00:00:53.670> they'll<00:00:53.940> make<00:00:54.090> another<00:00:54.390> game<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.840> that
