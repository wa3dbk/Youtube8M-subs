 we find here in the action of the

 name of doing the moringa in honor 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.030
 one of the plants that are there 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.450
 cultivating and that's the reason I'm from 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.340
 this house hotel the bite is original 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.700
 of India is characterized by its level 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.370
 protein of 28 percent what has 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.160
 led to this plant being studied 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.489
 by world authorities such as fao 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.680
 that as we know in the organization 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.290
 world for food this 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.130
 entity has come to establish all 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.860
 the benefits of this plant 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.650
 even at the scientific level at the level of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.420
 studies that have been developing 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.510
 there is talk that this 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.970
 and preventing adding about 300 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.310
 diseases give witnesses to many 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.980
 people and many studies that are 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.730
 using to prevent cancer for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.620
 prevent diabetes to prevent everything 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.520
 type of diseases

 edward tri tease for different shapes 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.350
 of cancer that they are giving you and finally 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.790
 one the main characteristics that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.130
 has is that it is highly diuretic what 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 that makes us and leads us to think all 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.959
 the benefits you want by alone 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.600
 reason to be diuretic if this is 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.269
 we add the high level benefit 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.700
 protein but we should get to 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.760
 conclude as everyone has done 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.000
 considered as the miracle plant this 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.209
 Plant has also had characteristics 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.750
 as having four times more protected 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.110
 no cow's milk 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.650
 four times more calcium than milk 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.160
 cow put seven times more vitamin than 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.310
 the carrot put in case of 15 and 17 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.010
 times more iron than spinach this 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.070
 property type alone talks about 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.740
 the goodness of the plant and that's why 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.549
 you know it as the miracle plant here 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.650
 precisely in these areas of this 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.650
 house hotel known as the action of the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.350
 moringa has developed in about 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.650
 quite poor soils quite of 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.020
 sterile and that gives us the opportunity to think and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.810
 I can observe and handle over 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.540
 what are the benefits of this 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.210
 plant because if a plant with so many 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.310
 benefits like the ones I'm announcing 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.100
 and like those in the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.460
 Literature is not able to give itself 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.490
 land 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.770
 So years as dry as where we 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.389
 we find that we will measure the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.419
 high benefits that we can have 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.750
 when we go to other dictionaries in 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.630
 where they are truly rich land 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.930
 then productivity would be great 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.930
 quality
