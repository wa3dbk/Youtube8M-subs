conventional tell the width of the tub

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.110 
conventional tell the width of the tub
is<00:02:56.780> basically<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:59.430> where<00:02:59.610> your<00:02:59.819> shower

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
is basically to where your shower

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.319 
is basically to where your shower
curtain<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.690> now<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.370> curve<00:03:02.700> rod<00:03:03.000> as

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
curtain is now with this curve rod as

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.470 
curtain is now with this curve rod as
you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:05.040> actually<00:03:05.700> sticking<00:03:06.060> like

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you can see it's actually sticking like

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.319 
you can see it's actually sticking like
it<00:03:07.079> starts<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> curve<00:03:08.099> starts<00:03:08.400> six<00:03:08.790> inches<00:03:09.120> in

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
it starts the curve starts six inches in

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.470 
it starts the curve starts six inches in
from<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.750> tubs<00:03:10.019> edge<00:03:10.459> but<00:03:11.459> then<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.940> where<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
from the tubs edge but then as where the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.750 
from the tubs edge but then as where the
curve<00:03:12.690> comes<00:03:13.049> out<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.380> maximizes<00:03:14.280> it's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
curve comes out and maximizes it's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.970 
curve comes out and maximizes it's
actually<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.450> eight<00:03:15.750> inches<00:03:15.930> past<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.650> tub

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
actually about eight inches past the tub

for a galley minute with big shoulders

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.270 
for a galley minute with big shoulders
you're<00:03:22.230> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> lot<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.799> extra<00:03:23.250> room

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
you're going to have a lot of extra room

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
you're going to have a lot of extra room
in<00:03:23.609> there<00:03:25.160> let's<00:03:26.160> see<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.519> else<00:03:27.380> we<00:03:28.380> have

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
in there let's see what else we have

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.960 
in there let's see what else we have
done<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.099> vertical<00:03:30.709> talking<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.609> corners

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
done the vertical talking in the corners

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
done the vertical talking in the corners
with<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.180> color-matched<00:03:33.769> product<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.160> is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
with a color-matched product that is

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.300 
with a color-matched product that is
actually<00:03:35.880> grote<00:03:36.329> mixed<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:37.470> silicone<00:03:38.040> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
actually grote mixed with silicone I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.159 
actually grote mixed with silicone I
like<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.209> vertical<00:03:39.599> lines<00:03:39.750> because

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
like it for the vertical lines because

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.390 
like it for the vertical lines because
it<00:03:40.290> does<00:03:40.440> come<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.769> two<00:03:40.889> different<00:03:41.010> color

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it does come in two different color

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.949 
it does come in two different color
views<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.329> match<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.480> up<00:03:42.720> really

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
views so you can match it up really

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.490 
views so you can match it up really
nicely<00:03:43.760> with<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> grout<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.359> always<00:03:46.260> use<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
nicely with the grout I always use a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.650 
nicely with the grout I always use a
hundred<00:03:46.769> percent<00:03:47.090> silicone<00:03:48.090> for<00:03:48.329> around

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
hundred percent silicone for around

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.280 
hundred percent silicone for around
around<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.349> tub<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:51.510> know<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:51.870> even<00:03:52.200> though

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
around the tub you know what even though

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.710 
around the tub you know what even though
like<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.769> great<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.280> talking<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.880> always<00:03:54.450> use

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
like I'm great at talking I always use

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.930 
like I'm great at talking I always use
tape<00:03:55.019> I'll<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> line<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.340> top<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.579> tape<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
tape I'll do a line on the top of tape a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.949 
tape I'll do a line on the top of tape a
line<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.599> on<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.870> tile<00:03:59.450> spread<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.630> the

caulking<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.829> way<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.609> really

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
caulking in and that way you can really

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.699 
caulking in and that way you can really
force<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.480> cocking<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:03.989> with<00:04:04.139> your<00:04:04.260> finger<00:04:04.590> as

force the cocking in with your finger as

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
force the cocking in with your finger as
you're<00:04:04.950> going<00:04:05.069> along<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.970> doesn't<00:04:06.329> squish

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
all over the place obviously and then

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.520 
all over the place obviously and then
once<00:04:08.639> you've<00:04:08.849> packed<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.419> in<00:04:09.510> there<00:04:09.690> tape
