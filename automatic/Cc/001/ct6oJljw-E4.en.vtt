have a look at that pause the video if

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
have a look at that pause the video if
you<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.320> make<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:59.270> to<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.390> your

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you want you to make your to make your

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
you want you to make your to make your
class<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> yeah<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> mtar<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:05.100> end<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
class but so yeah the mtar the end has a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.480 
class but so yeah the mtar the end has a
good<00:01:05.729> gun<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.560> used<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.950> long<00:01:08.250> range

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
good gun it can be used at long range

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.640 
good gun it can be used at long range
and<00:01:09.110> short<00:01:10.110> range<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.799> um<00:01:11.869> yeah<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.200> I've

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and short range but um yeah this is I've

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
and short range but um yeah this is I've
got<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:13.860> Ripper<00:01:14.220> footage<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
got some Ripper footage here because I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
got some Ripper footage here because I
thought<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> one

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
thought this would probably be the one

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.410 
thought this would probably be the one
alternative<00:01:17.490> gun<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> I'd<00:01:18.030> bring<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
alternative gun that I'd bring in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
alternative gun that I'd bring in
instead<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> mtar<00:01:21.470> mostly<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
instead of the mtar mostly because you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.190 
instead of the mtar mostly because you
can<00:01:22.979> shoot<00:01:23.189> people

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
can shoot people

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.999 
can shoot people
long<00:01:25.200> range<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.009> swap<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> assault

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
long range where you can swap to assault

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
long range where you can swap to assault
but<00:01:29.990> yeah<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.799> recommend<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> mtar<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
but yeah I recommend the mtar because it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
but yeah I recommend the mtar because it
did<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.900> patched<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.950> sure

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
did get patched a little bit I'm sure

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.960 
did get patched a little bit I'm sure
but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:36.509> still<00:01:36.810> using<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
but I I'm still using it so so the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.230 
but I I'm still using it so so the
Remington<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> next<00:01:39.869> gun<00:01:41.060> there<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
Remington is the next gun there are a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.560 
Remington is the next gun there are a
lot<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.570> people<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.290> gun<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.570> I'll

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
lot of people like this gun and I'll

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350 
lot of people like this gun and I'll
I've<00:01:45.750> sort<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> been<00:01:46.200> tossing<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.360> between

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
I've sort of been tossing up between

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.100 
I've sort of been tossing up between
which<00:01:49.110> attachments<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
which attachments to use on it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
which attachments to use on it
I<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:54.299> sopressa<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> definite<00:01:55.950> for

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
I think sopressa is like a definite for

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.470 
I think sopressa is like a definite for
me<00:01:56.250> now

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.680 

and<00:01:58.890> I've<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:00.250> started<00:02:00.730> teas<00:02:01.060> red<00:02:01.330> dot<00:02:01.510> I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and I've actually started teas red dot I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630 
and I've actually started teas red dot I
don't<00:02:01.900> have<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.560> gameplay<00:02:03.070> but<00:02:03.460> um

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
don't have that on this gameplay but um

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.180 
don't have that on this gameplay but um
I<00:02:04.000> think<00:02:04.900> it's<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.500> think<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.800> really<00:02:05.890> works

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
I think it's I think it really works

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.910 
I think it's I think it really works
well<00:02:06.510> see<00:02:07.510> ya<00:02:07.870> on<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.200> class<00:02:08.410> setup<00:02:08.650> I<00:02:08.890> have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
well see ya on the class setup I have

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.950

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
muzzle break and extended mags but I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.480 
muzzle break and extended mags but I
don't<00:02:11.320> use<00:02:11.530> my<00:02:11.710> little<00:02:11.800> break<00:02:12.010> right<00:02:12.040> off<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
don't use my little break right off the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.230 
don't use my little break right off the
nail<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.030> she<00:02:13.420> suppressed<00:02:13.810> her<00:02:13.930> instead

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.070 
yeah the reference II in this gameplay
here<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> red<00:02:25.420> dot<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
here I have the red dot and the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.650 
here I have the red dot and the
suppressor<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.420> gives

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
suppressor on and I think it just gives

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.340 
suppressor on and I think it just gives
you<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.470> extra<00:02:29.830> accuracy<00:02:31.350> especially

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you that that extra accuracy especially

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.290 
you that that extra accuracy especially
at<00:02:32.440> long-range<00:02:32.680> because<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> iron<00:02:33.940> sights

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
at long-range because the iron sights

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.140 
at long-range because the iron sights
like<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.320> don't<00:02:36.100> find<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.820> very<00:02:36.850> good<00:02:37.030> for

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
like I don't find it very good for

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.820 
like I don't find it very good for
shooting<00:02:37.510> people<00:02:37.660> at<00:02:37.870> long<00:02:38.020> range<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.830> even

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
shooting people at long range and even

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.080 
shooting people at long range and even
with<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.040> suppressor<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.700> doesn't<00:02:42.970> have<00:02:43.060> that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
with the suppressor it doesn't have that

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.420 
with the suppressor it doesn't have that
much<00:02:43.300> recoil<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.920> pretty<00:02:45.160> it's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
much recoil so it's it's pretty it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.490 
much recoil so it's it's pretty it's
pretty<00:02:45.490> good<00:02:48.570> yeah<00:02:49.570> that's<00:02:49.870> about<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
pretty good yeah that's about it for the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.570 
pretty good yeah that's about it for the
moment<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:53.740> again<00:02:54.010> play<00:02:54.280> here

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.400 

also<00:03:00.580> another<00:03:00.910> alternative<00:03:01.570> for<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.840> gun<00:03:02.080> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
also another alternative for this gun is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.980 
also another alternative for this gun is
the<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.770> K<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.460> lot<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.090> people<00:03:04.300> use<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.690> K<00:03:04.930> but

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
the a K a lot of people use the a K but

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.720 
the a K a lot of people use the a K but
I<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.350> find<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.680> they<00:03:05.830> has<00:03:06.220> way<00:03:06.460> too<00:03:06.490> much

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
I just find that they has way too much

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.350 
I just find that they has way too much
recoil<00:03:07.240> with<00:03:07.450> suppressor<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.140> now<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.970> still

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
recoil with suppressor on it now I still

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.730 
recoil with suppressor on it now I still
use<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.570> occasionally<00:03:11.260> wasn't<00:03:11.530> trying<00:03:11.710> to

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
use that occasionally wasn't trying to

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.150 
use that occasionally wasn't trying to
occur<00:03:12.070> for<00:03:12.250> Kem's<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.730> things<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.920> think<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
occur for Kem's and things but I think I

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.130 
occur for Kem's and things but I think I
prefer<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.460> Rivington<00:03:15.940> now<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:18.720> yeah<00:03:19.720> the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
prefer the Rivington now and yeah the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.460 
prefer the Rivington now and yeah the
the<00:03:20.470> Ripper's<00:03:21.840> cansada<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:22.990> used<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.320> long

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the Ripper's cansada be used to long

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.320 
the Ripper's cansada be used to long
range<00:03:23.680> -<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.220> I'd<00:03:24.370> stick<00:03:24.640> with<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.880> Remington

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
range - but I'd stick with the Remington

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.650 
range - but I'd stick with the Remington
for<00:03:25.540> medium<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.020> long<00:03:26.170> range<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.850> trace<00:03:31.480> all

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
for medium to long range I I trace all

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.250 
for medium to long range I I trace all
these<00:03:31.810> classes<00:03:32.670> more<00:03:33.670> based<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.260> choosing

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
these classes more based on choosing

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.650 
these classes more based on choosing
three<00:03:35.620> classes<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.550> would<00:03:36.760> work<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.330> every

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
three classes that would work on every

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.780 
three classes that would work on every
map<00:03:37.870> sir<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.590> also<00:03:39.310> put<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.670> sniper<00:03:40.150> one<00:03:40.270> in<00:03:40.420> here

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
map sir I also put a sniper one in here

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.850 
map sir I also put a sniper one in here
now<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.180> pretty<00:03:43.630> much<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.930> sniper<00:03:44.440> setup

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
now this is pretty much a sniper setup

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.930 
now this is pretty much a sniper setup
that<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.130> use<00:03:45.370> all<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.700> time<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.800> do<00:03:48.610> like<00:03:48.910> a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
that I use all the time I I do like a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.610 
that I use all the time I I do like a
hybrid<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.510> quick<00:03:49.840> scoping<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:52.620> aiming

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
hybrid of quick scoping and like aiming

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.100 
hybrid of quick scoping and like aiming
down<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.130> map<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.640> do<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.239> bit<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.450> both

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
down the map I do a bit of both

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.880 
down the map I do a bit of both
like<00:03:56.590> i<00:03:57.690> quickscope<00:03:58.690> as<00:03:59.080> much<00:03:59.260> as<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.530> can't

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.170 

in<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.010> snap<00:04:05.280> setup<00:04:05.700> II's<00:04:06.290> curtain<00:04:07.290> lined<00:04:07.470> and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
in a snap setup II's curtain lined and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.340 
in a snap setup II's curtain lined and
piercing

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
piercing

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.690 
piercing
sometimes<00:04:10.350> I'll<00:04:10.560> decide<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.069> use<00:04:11.190> them<00:04:11.490> all

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
sometimes I'll decide to use them all

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.330 
sometimes I'll decide to use them all
but<00:04:12.050> most<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.319> time<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.740> use<00:04:14.040> crime

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
but most of the time I just use crime

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.819 
but most of the time I just use crime
lined<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.819> I'm<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> piercing<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.780> find<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.709> it

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
lined and I'm a piercing I find that it

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.370 
lined and I'm a piercing I find that it
works<00:04:17.150> best<00:04:18.150> long<00:04:18.750> range

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
works best long range

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.300 
works best long range
I<00:04:21.440> mostly<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.560> make<00:04:22.919> sure<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> have

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
I mostly just make sure I have

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.420 
I mostly just make sure I have
quick-draw<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.290> can<00:04:25.470> quick<00:04:25.650> scope<00:04:25.950> and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
quick-draw on so I can quick scope and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.520 
quick-draw on so I can quick scope and
focus<00:04:27.389> so<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:27.630> when<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.110> shot<00:04:28.380> it

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
focus so that when I get a shot it

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.200 
focus so that when I get a shot it
doesn't<00:04:28.830> make<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.070> like<00:04:29.220> impossible<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:30.000> shoot

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
doesn't make it like impossible to shoot

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.900 
doesn't make it like impossible to shoot
people<00:04:34.190> yeah<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:36.320> think<00:04:37.320> that's<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
people yeah I think that's the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.480 
people yeah I think that's the
scorestreaks<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.150> sometimes<00:04:39.450> use<00:04:40.490> assault

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
scorestreaks I sometimes use assault

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.670 
scorestreaks I sometimes use assault
with<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.760> sniper<00:04:42.030> depending<00:04:42.900> on<00:04:43.020> what<00:04:43.169> map<00:04:43.380> and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
with a sniper depending on what map and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.210 
with a sniper depending on what map and
then<00:04:43.800> I'll<00:04:43.919> just<00:04:44.130> use<00:04:45.200> support<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.530> lot<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.130> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
then I'll just use support a lot of the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.070 
then I'll just use support a lot of the
time<00:04:47.430> because<00:04:48.030> I'll<00:04:48.330> get<00:04:48.480> shot<00:04:48.720> but<00:04:48.990> I'll

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
time because I'll get shot but I'll

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.510 
time because I'll get shot but I'll
still<00:04:49.350> get<00:04:49.470> enough<00:04:49.710> kills<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.250> get<00:04:50.370> the

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
still get enough kills to get the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.710 
still get enough kills to get the
support<00:04:50.790> kill<00:04:51.060> streaks<00:04:55.130> yeah<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.370> that's

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720
