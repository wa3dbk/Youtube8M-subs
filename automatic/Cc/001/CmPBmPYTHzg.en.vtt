hill<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.990> end<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.320> kind<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.530> going

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
hill and at the end it's kind of going

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.830 
hill and at the end it's kind of going
uphill<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.310> slowing<00:02:33.670> down<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.630> I'm

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
uphill and I'm slowing down and I so I'm

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.990 
uphill and I'm slowing down and I so I'm
gonna<00:02:34.960> slide<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.440> end<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.520> guess<00:02:36.760> like

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
gonna slide the end so like guess like

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.460 
gonna slide the end so like guess like

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
pretty sure they're 75 millimeter I

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.460 
pretty sure they're 75 millimeter I
don't<00:03:33.070> remember<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.550> these<00:03:34.360> ones<00:03:34.630> are<00:03:34.900> super

I<00:03:41.320> bomb<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.610> can<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:42.790> go<00:03:43.420> into<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
I bomb with and I can just go into the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.590 
I bomb with and I can just go into the
slide<00:03:44.019> right<00:03:44.230> after<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.820> yeah<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.420> sold

slide right after that so yeah and sold

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.229 
slide right after that so yeah and sold
and<00:03:46.900> then<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:47.890> not<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:49.030> thing

leg is like it just grips when you need
it<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:52.600> steep<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.260> slightly

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
it to and it steep but it's slightly

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.710 
it to and it steep but it's slightly
else<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.160> it's<00:03:54.280> slides<00:03:54.550> super<00:03:55.030> nice<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.570> it's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
else but it's slides super nice so it's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.030 
else but it's slides super nice so it's
not<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:57.130> can<00:03:57.160> it's<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.820> like<00:03:58.000> um

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
not like you can it's not just like um

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.740 
not like you can it's not just like um
it's<00:04:00.040> not<00:04:00.220> just<00:04:00.400> like<00:04:00.550> like<00:04:00.760> plane<00:04:01.209> first<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's not just like like plane first and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.720 
it's not just like like plane first and
I<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.080> little<00:04:02.680> de<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> bit<00:04:03.370> little

cannot I mean those ones you can I guess

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.270 
cannot I mean those ones you can I guess
you<00:04:10.870> could<00:04:10.930> slide<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.860> mean<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.100> guess<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you could slide but I mean I guess I

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.030 
you could slide but I mean I guess I
mean<00:04:12.730> not<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.180> guess<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.600> could<00:04:13.739> get<00:04:14.739> some

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
mean not so I guess you could get some

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.590 
mean not so I guess you could get some
speed<00:04:15.370> but<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.790> those<00:04:16.030> ones<00:04:16.180> don't<00:04:16.419> go

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
speed but I know those ones don't go

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.659 
speed but I know those ones don't go
that<00:04:16.840> fast<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.470> mean<00:04:17.890> those<00:04:18.010> ones<00:04:18.280> don't<00:04:18.430> go
