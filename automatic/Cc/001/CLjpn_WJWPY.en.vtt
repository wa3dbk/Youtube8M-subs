let's see if I can get the website to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.789 
let's see if I can get the website to
pull<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.810> can't<00:01:19.500> read<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
pull up and I can't read it in the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
pull up and I can't read it in the
bottom<00:01:20.040> focused<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.520> anyways<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.299> really

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
bottom focused but anyways it's really

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
bottom focused but anyways it's really
neat<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.950> what<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.939> take

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
neat because what you do is you take

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
neat because what you do is you take
this<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.310> plug<00:01:26.310> something<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.229> I'll

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this and plug something into it and I'll

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
this and plug something into it and I'll
hold<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.210> wish<00:01:30.509> i<00:01:30.659> had<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hold it up there so i wish i had a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
hold it up there so i wish i had a
tripod<00:01:31.460> I'll<00:01:32.460> take<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:37.939> look<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.090> their<00:01:39.270> push

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
tripod I'll take this look at their push

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
tripod I'll take this look at their push
your<00:01:39.990> tight<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.740> stays<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
your tight and I not stays there and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
your tight and I not stays there and
then<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> take<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> cable<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.470> cell<00:01:43.680> phone

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
then you take the cable your cell phone

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.719 
then you take the cable your cell phone
cord<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> wrap<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> around

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
cord and you just kind of wrap it around

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:57.990 
cord and you just kind of wrap it around
this<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:49.290> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.430 

the<00:01:59.000> only<00:01:59.210> thing<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.450> but<00:01:59.840> I<00:01:59.870> think<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.320> might

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the only thing is but I think that might

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.920 
the only thing is but I think that might
modify<00:02:00.860> mine<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.550> right<00:02:02.120> here<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.600> piece<00:02:02.810> of

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
modify mine and right here just piece of

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.750 
modify mine and right here just piece of
plastic<00:02:03.440> but<00:02:03.650> i<00:02:03.710> think<00:02:03.980> i<00:02:04.070> might<00:02:04.190> take<00:02:04.430> one<00:02:04.670> of

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
plastic but i think i might take one of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.060 
plastic but i think i might take one of
those<00:02:04.880> dashboards<00:02:05.360> cell<00:02:06.050> phone<00:02:06.260> jelly<00:02:06.680> grips

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
those dashboards cell phone jelly grips

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.910 
those dashboards cell phone jelly grips
and<00:02:07.720> glue<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.990> here<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.530> has<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:09.710> lot<00:02:09.860> of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
and glue it on here so that has a lot of

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.010 
and glue it on here so that has a lot of
grip<00:02:10.190> or<00:02:10.610> something<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.600> that's<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
grip or something like that that's a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.050 
grip or something like that that's a
little<00:02:12.230> more<00:02:12.350> grippy<00:02:12.710> because<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.880> really

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
little more grippy because this really

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.510 
little more grippy because this really
isn't<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.450> creepy<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.080> otherwise<00:02:15.800> i<00:02:16.130> want

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
isn't that creepy so otherwise i want

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720 
isn't that creepy so otherwise i want
just<00:02:16.700> take<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> rip<00:02:17.390> silicon<00:02:17.960> case<00:02:18.490> phone<00:02:19.490> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
just take a rip silicon case phone and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.750 
just take a rip silicon case phone and
glue<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.570> something<00:02:21.020> but<00:02:21.980> then

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.410 
is the record what so you guys see how
that<00:02:31.160> works<00:02:31.280> which<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.730> really<00:02:31.910> nice<00:02:32.090> actually

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
that works which is really nice actually

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.320 
that works which is really nice actually
because<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.770> it'd<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:33.980> nice<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.340> i<00:02:34.850> get<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> wall

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
because but it'd be nice if i get a wall

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.120 
because but it'd be nice if i get a wall
plug<00:02:35.600> like<00:02:35.870> up<00:02:36.080> here<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.500> something<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.070> it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
plug like up here or something so it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.340 
plug like up here or something so it
would<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.310> closer<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.510> then<00:02:39.020> down<00:02:39.320> here

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
would be closer to you then down here

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.920 
would be closer to you then down here
but<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:40.550> still<00:02:40.820> really<00:02:41.000> nice<00:02:41.270> otherwise<00:02:41.720> it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
but it's still really nice otherwise it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.710 
but it's still really nice otherwise it
for<00:02:42.260> your<00:02:42.350> camera<00:02:42.740> may<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.580> great<00:02:43.880> place<00:02:44.330> but

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
for your camera may be a great place but

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.680 
for your camera may be a great place but
i<00:02:45.020> think<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.860> great<00:02:46.190> idea<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.540> you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
i think it's a great idea and then you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.290 
i think it's a great idea and then you
could<00:02:47.900> even<00:02:48.260> surf<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.040> shaky<00:02:49.280> video<00:02:49.490> I'm<00:02:50.090> just
