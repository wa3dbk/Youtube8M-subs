well<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.480> think<00:00:00.690> Israel<00:00:01.260> has<00:00:01.350> got<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.650> make<00:00:01.770> a

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
well I think Israel has got to make a

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.980 
well I think Israel has got to make a
decision<00:00:01.920> very<00:00:02.760> very<00:00:03.149> shortly<00:00:03.659> whether

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
decision very very shortly whether

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.440 
decision very very shortly whether
they're<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> use<00:00:04.650> military<00:00:04.920> force

they're going to use military force

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.519 
they're going to use military force
preemptively<00:00:06.450> against<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.140> nuclear

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
preemptively against that nuclear

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.500 
preemptively against that nuclear
weapons<00:00:07.919> program<00:00:08.400> because<00:00:08.940> if<00:00:09.090> they<00:00:09.269> don't

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
weapons program because if they don't

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.169 
weapons program because if they don't
the<00:00:09.719> odds<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.469> outcome<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.150> very

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the odds on outcome is that in a very

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.480 
the odds on outcome is that in a very
short<00:00:12.570> period<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.230> time<00:00:13.290> Iran<00:00:13.889> will<00:00:14.250> have

most important state sponsors of
terrorism<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> odds<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:56.190> under

military strike against Iran are about

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070 
military strike against Iran are about
as<00:01:01.890> close<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> absolute<00:01:02.760> zero<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.899> can

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
as close to absolute zero as you can

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.410 
as close to absolute zero as you can
imagine<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:05.070> why<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> spotlight<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.360> on

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
imagine that's why the spotlight is on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
imagine that's why the spotlight is on
Israel<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> administration<00:01:08.130> seems<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> think
