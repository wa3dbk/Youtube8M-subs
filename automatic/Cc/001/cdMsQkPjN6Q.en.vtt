might be a pain so what I do is kind of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.690 
might be a pain so what I do is kind of
make<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.800> that<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:14.120> slant<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.700> it's

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
make it like that to slant it it's

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.869 
make it like that to slant it it's
perfectly<00:05:17.360> round<00:05:18.040> in<00:05:19.040> there<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:21.010> go

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879
