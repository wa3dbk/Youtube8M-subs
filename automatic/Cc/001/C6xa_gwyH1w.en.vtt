red has been a good color for me over
the<00:00:11.240> years<00:00:11.560> especially<00:00:12.560> post<00:00:13.250> spawning

the years especially post spawning

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.340 
the years especially post spawning
periods<00:00:14.240> like<00:00:14.390> in<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.630> fall<00:00:14.840> when<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:15.110> Browns

again to create the segmentation once we

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.609 
again to create the segmentation once we

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
tiny collar out of peacock curl I'd like

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.270 
tiny collar out of peacock curl I'd like
to<00:02:19.069> use<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> eye<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.090> peacock<00:02:20.480> curl<00:02:21.280> versus
