we've<00:00:55.760> done<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> video<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.539> earlier<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
we've done a video about that earlier I

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
we've done a video about that earlier I
packed<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> berries<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> pretty<00:01:00.930> close

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
packed the berries in pretty close

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
packed the berries in pretty close
together<00:01:02.070> I'll<00:01:02.910> spread<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> little

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
together I'll spread them out a little

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.310 
together I'll spread them out a little
bit<00:01:04.250> but<00:01:05.840> high-density<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.170> we're

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bit but high-density is what we're

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.030 
bit but high-density is what we're
looking<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.740> gives<00:01:08.430> us<00:01:08.610> efficiency<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:10.040> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
looking for gives us efficiency in in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
looking for gives us efficiency in in
our<00:01:11.310> growing<00:01:12.350> then<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> sprinkled<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
our growing then I sprinkled some the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
our growing then I sprinkled some the
mixture<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.990> top<00:01:16.290> other<00:01:17.009> times<00:01:17.430> I've<00:01:17.670> covered

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mixture on top other times I've covered

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
mixture on top other times I've covered
it<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.240> newspapers<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.350> covered<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.799> with

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it with newspapers or covered it with

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.399 
it with newspapers or covered it with
black<00:01:20.159> plastic<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> give<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.290> the
