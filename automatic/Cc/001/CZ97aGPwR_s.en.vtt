00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
following you will place this block down

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.389 
following you will place this block down
like<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:25.399> will<00:01:25.850> spawn<00:01:26.299> all<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.079> now

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
like so it will spawn all this and now

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.910 
like so it will spawn all this and now
it<00:01:28.399> says<00:01:28.640> left<00:01:29.360> click<00:01:29.659> with<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:29.930> block<00:01:30.229> with<00:01:30.890> a

it says left click with a block with a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.120 
it says left click with a block with a
tool<00:01:31.299> and<00:01:32.299> that<00:01:32.689> in<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.500> way<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:33.979> select

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
same way with this one only you will

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.650 
same way with this one only you will
need<00:05:55.980> to<00:05:56.160> use<00:05:56.370> a<00:05:57.210> chest<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:58.380> activate<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.920> and

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
need to use a chest to activate it and

need to use a chest to activate it and
what<00:06:00.660> this<00:06:00.900> will<00:06:01.080> basically<00:06:01.170> do<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:02.520> will

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
what this will basically do is it will

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.860 
what this will basically do is it will
turn<00:06:02.850> all<00:06:03.150> your<00:06:03.650> of<00:06:05.330> valuable<00:06:06.330> stuff<00:06:06.360> into

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
valuable stuff and it basically works

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.700 
valuable stuff and it basically works
just<00:06:09.930> like<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:11.430> one<00:06:11.610> exchange<00:06:12.060> mod<00:06:12.710> that

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
just like that one exchange mod that

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.610 
just like that one exchange mod that
whose<00:06:14.280> name<00:06:14.580> I<00:06:14.730> just<00:06:14.970> forgot<00:06:15.620> equivalent
