00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.430
 I am standing here on the ifa in Berlin next 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.360
 the sony xperia z ultra 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.610
 and the sony xperia z already exists 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.320
 this specimen is still ultra 'and 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.810
 why do they call him so he extra 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.369
 big is the extra mile 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.740
 we are on a few special things 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.900
 this phone and that is actually you 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.400
 can operate with your fingers with a 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.680
 supplied pen 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.410
 but also with just a pen you 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.390
 just lie at home 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.460
 this smartphone is out there too 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.739
 yes waterproof they say he has a half 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.550
 hour underwater can be up to one and a half meters 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.199
 depth 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.120
 do you know what happens after 31 minutes 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.949
 but yes that is at least here 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.190
 of course, that is what we want 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.000
 like to test some important ones 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.970
 specs the screen diagonal is 6.4 inches and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.610
 a resolution is 1080 by 1920 pixels 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.559
 so that means full hd 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.510
 the thickness of the device actually has to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.570
 I say points is six and a half 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.930
 millimeter and the internal memory can 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.299
 be expanded with a micro sd card 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.100
 sony used some nice terms 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.450
 for the screen that his family is mine 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.729
 an x-reality 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.659
 if we set up this video then you can 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.580
 see you I think it's personal 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.369
 just yes a very nice screen 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.570
 contrast sees different colors of red 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 yes i just think it is really very good 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 look 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.420
 the camera on these smartphones lessons 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.119
 phablet has the 8 megapixels 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.829
 what is missing is the flash i have that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.329
 of course just asked the sony van 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.130
 what the reason for that is the one 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.649
 person told me to make it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.969
 yes with that because the device is like that 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.369
 he is thin he doesn't like it anymore 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.140
 and the other person told me 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.569
 that it has to do with actually such a thing 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.369
 good sensor that you have that flash 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.960
 actually don't need anything at all 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.600
 the reason is he is in any case 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.670
 not on if you are going to call this one 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.829
 ultra you have a large device on 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.350
 your ear therefore sony also comes with a 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.899
 kind of a headset you clip what you through 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.110
 nfc connect and that way you can 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.200
 You do not have your phone calling them 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.280
 need it to your ear it is 69 euros 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 cost 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.690
 and he is not alone with sony 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.000
 devices say to connect 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 but also with other phones that NFC you 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 to have 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.940
 in short the ultra 'is a big one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.880
 device and at the same time actually whole 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.410
