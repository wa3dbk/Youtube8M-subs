perform very well feel free to go build
the<00:02:57.720> guys<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.200> fairly<00:02:58.710> cheap<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
the guys it is fairly cheap and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
the guys it is fairly cheap and
obviously<00:03:00.150> there's<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.480> few<00:03:00.750> different

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
obviously there's a few different

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.380 
obviously there's a few different
variations<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.520> basically

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
variations you can do with it basically

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
variations you can do with it basically
because<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.690> have<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> lot<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.140> strong<00:03:04.500> links<00:03:04.860> in

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
because I have a lot of strong links in

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.010 
because I have a lot of strong links in
here<00:03:05.160> pupils<00:03:05.970> see<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.300> both<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.660> strikers

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
here pupils see that both the strikers

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.540 
here pupils see that both the strikers
in<00:03:07.050> both<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.560> mids<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:07.920> extremely<00:03:08.430> strong

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
in both the mids have extremely strong

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.370 
in both the mids have extremely strong
links<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.060> each<00:03:09.240> other<00:03:09.420> which<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.900> why<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
links with each other which is why it is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.500 
links with each other which is why it is
possible<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.890> even<00:03:11.220> make<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.580> team<00:03:11.760> now<00:03:12.330> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
possible to even make this team now that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.180 
possible to even make this team now that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.500 
guys will actually you know come to see
in<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.490> few<00:03:20.670> minutes<00:03:20.850> here<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.240> did

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in a few minutes here now we did

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.060 
in a few minutes here now we did
actually<00:03:21.660> go<00:03:21.990> with<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.230> old<00:03:22.410> Diego<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.040> we

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
actually go with the old Diego so we

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.800 
actually go with the old Diego so we
went<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.490> wolfsburg<00:03:23.910> Diego<00:03:24.300> rather

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
went with the wolfsburg Diego rather

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.260 
went with the wolfsburg Diego rather
than<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.230> athletico<00:03:25.830> madrid<00:03:26.160> basically<00:03:27.090> just

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
than the athletico madrid basically just

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.610 
than the athletico madrid basically just
due<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.600> fact<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.140> gives<00:03:28.410> better

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
due to the fact that it gives better

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770 
due to the fact that it gives better
chemistry<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.490> instance<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.600> some

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
chemistry in this instance and for some

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.330 
chemistry in this instance and for some
reason<00:03:30.810> there's<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.560> kind<00:03:31.740> of<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.890> theory<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
reason there's just kind of a theory and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830 
reason there's just kind of a theory and
fee<00:03:32.460> for<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:33.030> card<00:03:33.270> actually<00:03:33.480> plays

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
fee for that one card actually plays

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.960 
fee for that one card actually plays
better<00:03:34.110> than<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> other<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.760> for

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
better than the other and that just for

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.700 
better than the other and that just for
me<00:03:36.090> personally<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.110> some<00:03:37.290> people<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
me personally and for some people that I

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.310 
me personally and for some people that I
was<00:03:37.950> asking<00:03:38.450> apparently<00:03:39.450> Wolfsburg<00:03:39.960> Diego

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
was asking apparently Wolfsburg Diego

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.540 
was asking apparently Wolfsburg Diego
plays<00:03:40.530> much<00:03:40.800> much<00:03:41.010> better<00:03:41.190> than<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
plays much much better than the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.340 
plays much much better than the
athletica<00:03:42.090> one<00:03:42.270> nonetheless<00:03:42.750> guys<00:03:43.140> he's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
athletica one nonetheless guys he's

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.660 
athletica one nonetheless guys he's
still<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> very<00:03:43.920> good<00:03:44.100> player<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.370> real<00:03:44.490> life

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
still a very good player in real life

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.310 
still a very good player in real life
obviously<00:03:45.150> he<00:03:45.270> did<00:03:45.420> get<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> transfer<00:03:46.020> over

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
obviously he did get the transfer over

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.650 
obviously he did get the transfer over
to<00:03:46.460> athletico<00:03:47.460> madrid<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> certain<00:03:48.630> reason

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
to athletico madrid for a certain reason

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750 
to athletico madrid for a certain reason
kind<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.500> an<00:03:49.590> upgrade<00:03:49.770> from<00:03:50.070> Wolfsburg<00:03:50.610> at

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
kind of an upgrade from Wolfsburg at

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.790 
kind of an upgrade from Wolfsburg at
least<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.030> would<00:03:51.180> say<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.390> myself<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.560> as<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
least I would say so myself but as you

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.470 
least I would say so myself but as you
can<00:03:52.890> see<00:03:53.070> on<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> right<00:03:53.580> minute<00:03:53.880> we<00:03:54.030> are<00:03:54.210> going

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
can see on the right minute we are going

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.790 
can see on the right minute we are going
with<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.690> juice<00:03:54.870> novice<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.470> guys<00:03:55.620> can

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
with a juice novice you guys can

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.470 
with a juice novice you guys can
probably<00:03:56.070> tell<00:03:56.250> who<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> strikers<00:03:57.150> are<00:03:57.180> going

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
probably tell who the strikers are going

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880 
probably tell who the strikers are going
to<00:03:57.540> be<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.870> squad<00:03:58.170> finishing<00:03:58.620> them<00:03:58.770> off

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
to be for the squad finishing them off

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.920 
to be for the squad finishing them off
seeing<00:03:59.430> as<00:03:59.520> they<00:03:59.670> are<00:03:59.850> both<00:04:00.090> extremely<00:04:00.360> strong

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
seeing as they are both extremely strong

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.840 
seeing as they are both extremely strong
links<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.410> they<00:04:02.010> kind<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.460> be<00:04:02.670> that

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
links and they kind of have to be that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.970 
links and they kind of have to be that
way<00:04:02.880> because<00:04:03.150> Diego<00:04:03.750> ends<00:04:04.110> up<00:04:04.200> not<00:04:04.440> connecting

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
way because Diego ends up not connecting

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.710 
way because Diego ends up not connecting
with<00:04:05.190> either<00:04:05.490> of<00:04:05.640> them<00:04:05.760> which<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.540> actually

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
with either of them which is actually

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.200 
with either of them which is actually
really<00:04:07.020> cool<00:04:07.230> i<00:04:07.290> never<00:04:07.680> knew<00:04:07.860> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.100> 352<00:04:08.550> that

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
really cool i never knew in the 352 that

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.550 
really cool i never knew in the 352 that
you<00:04:09.330> were<00:04:09.420> able<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:09.990> in<00:04:10.050> this<00:04:10.260> FIFA

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
you were able to do this in this FIFA

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.380 
you were able to do this in this FIFA
because<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.130> chemistry<00:04:11.550> system<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.240> little

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
because the chemistry system is a little

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.600 
because the chemistry system is a little
messed<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.110> most<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.620> guys<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:13.830> it's

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
messed up as most of you guys know it's

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.950 
messed up as most of you guys know it's
not<00:04:14.730> messed<00:04:14.970> up<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.270> just<00:04:15.330> changed<00:04:15.810> from

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
not messed up it's just changed from

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.479 
not messed up it's just changed from
before<00:04:16.109> now<00:04:16.710> this<00:04:16.890> is<00:04:16.950> actually<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
before now this is actually the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.580 
before now this is actually the
upgrading<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.060> Gretel<00:04:18.359> only<00:04:18.720> 1500<00:04:19.350> coins

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
feet 262 somewhere in that range I'm not

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.360 
feet 262 somewhere in that range I'm not
entirely<00:05:46.139> sure<00:05:46.320> on<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.620> exact<00:05:46.860> type<00:05:47.039> but<00:05:47.219> we

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
entirely sure on the exact type but we

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.490 
entirely sure on the exact type but we
paired<00:05:47.729> him<00:05:47.880> up<00:05:47.969> with<00:05:48.389> Negredo<00:05:48.750> Negredo<00:05:49.199> is<00:05:49.469> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
paired him up with Negredo Negredo is a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.170 
paired him up with Negredo Negredo is a
little<00:05:49.919> bit<00:05:50.009> slower<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.490> as<00:05:50.639> you<00:05:50.759> guys<00:05:50.909> did

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
little bit slower and as you guys did

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.480 
little bit slower and as you guys did
tell<00:05:51.449> he<00:05:52.080> does<00:05:52.289> have<00:05:52.500> medium<00:05:52.919> medium<00:05:53.280> work

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
tell he does have medium medium work

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.589 
tell he does have medium medium work
right<00:05:53.639> so<00:05:53.820> it's<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.030> little<00:05:54.240> bit<00:05:54.330> difficult

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
right so it's a little bit difficult

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.990 
right so it's a little bit difficult
working<00:05:55.050> with<00:05:55.320> him<00:05:55.469> he's<00:05:56.070> not<00:05:56.219> always<00:05:56.430> up<00:05:56.729> top

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
working with him he's not always up top

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.999 
working with him he's not always up top
but<00:05:57.570> so<00:05:57.870> far<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.199> partnership<00:05:58.620> has<00:05:58.770> worked

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
but so far the partnership has worked

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.010 
but so far the partnership has worked
out<00:05:59.159> pretty<00:05:59.310> well<00:05:59.490> Negredo<00:06:00.000> is<00:06:00.240> an<00:06:00.419> absolute

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
out pretty well Negredo is an absolute

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.080 
out pretty well Negredo is an absolute
beast<00:06:01.289> at<00:06:01.590> finishing<00:06:01.979> and<00:06:02.280> here's<00:06:02.849> Eddie

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
upgraded hazard so that's about 700 k

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.200

the<00:06:57.420> market<00:06:57.570> crash<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.080> prices<00:06:58.440> are<00:06:58.560> going<00:06:58.650> to

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
the market crash the prices are going to

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.680 
the market crash the prices are going to
be<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:58.860> little<00:06:59.130> bit<00:06:59.280> different<00:06:59.610> and<00:06:59.730> jared<00:07:00.510> has

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
be a little bit different and jared has

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.360 
be a little bit different and jared has
since<00:07:00.960> gone<00:07:01.170> down<00:07:01.440> most<00:07:01.710> likely<00:07:02.010> because<00:07:02.130> it

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
since gone down most likely because it

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.160 
since gone down most likely because it
was<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.760> team<00:07:02.940> of<00:07:03.030> the<00:07:03.060> week<00:07:03.210> on<00:07:03.420> that<00:07:03.840> he<00:07:04.020> was

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
was the team of the week on that he was

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.200 
was the team of the week on that he was
featured<00:07:04.350> in<00:07:04.590> one<00:07:05.040> that<00:07:05.190> did<00:07:05.340> happen<00:07:05.490> so

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
featured in one that did happen so

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.730 
featured in one that did happen so
obviously<00:07:06.540> that's<00:07:06.810> when<00:07:07.080> his<00:07:07.230> highest<00:07:07.440> price

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
obviously that's when his highest price

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.620 
obviously that's when his highest price
would<00:07:07.890> most<00:07:08.100> likely<00:07:08.310> be<00:07:08.610> so<00:07:08.820> anyways<00:07:09.510> guys

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
would most likely be so anyways guys

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.450 
would most likely be so anyways guys
thank<00:07:10.020> you<00:07:10.140> guys<00:07:10.260> so<00:07:10.740> much<00:07:10.770> for<00:07:11.010> being<00:07:11.340> here
