phone on your hair and it gives it a
little<00:02:09.880> texture<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.869> can<00:02:11.110> use<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.560> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
little texture so you can use so it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.140 
little texture so you can use so it's
essentially<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.240> damp<00:02:13.600> set<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.820> this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
essentially like a damp set but this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.740 
essentially like a damp set but this
helps<00:02:16.780> keep<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.800> curls<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.450> sounds

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
helps keep the curls in and it sounds

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
helps keep the curls in and it sounds
great<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.350> think<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.440> have<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> order<00:02:23.920> or

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
great I think this you have to order or

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.970 
great I think this you have to order or
you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.570> think<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.380> Lee's<00:02:26.650> I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you can get it I think it's a Lee's I

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.070 
you can get it I think it's a Lee's I
checked<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.150> they<00:02:28.420> were<00:02:28.480> out<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:31.080> ordered

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
checked and they were out so I ordered

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.030 
checked and they were out so I ordered
it<00:02:32.910> Amazon<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.200> will<00:02:35.500> last<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it Amazon but it will last you a really

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.270 
it Amazon but it will last you a really
long<00:02:36.250> time<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.850> think<00:02:37.209> probably<00:02:38.160> four<00:02:39.160> or<00:02:39.190> five

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
long time I think probably four or five

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.720 
long time I think probably four or five
months<00:02:39.400> maybe<00:02:40.830> I've<00:02:41.830> looked<00:02:42.130> everywhere<00:02:42.310> for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
months maybe I've looked everywhere for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.300 
months maybe I've looked everywhere for
a<00:02:43.420> foundation<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.140> would<00:02:44.440> work<00:02:44.620> for<00:02:44.860> my<00:02:45.010> skin

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
a foundation that would work for my skin

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.070 
a foundation that would work for my skin
that<00:02:45.489> wouldn't<00:02:45.730> give<00:02:45.820> me<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> weird<00:02:46.269> orange

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
that wouldn't give me a weird orange

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.630 
that wouldn't give me a weird orange
tent<00:02:47.590> or<00:02:47.980> red<00:02:48.670> pink<00:02:49.360> tint<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.580> was

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
tent or red pink tint and it's it was

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.850 
tent or red pink tint and it's it was
just<00:02:51.910> impossible<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.450> me<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.660> find<00:02:52.900> until<00:02:53.500> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
just impossible for me to find until I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.789 
just impossible for me to find until I
found<00:02:54.130> out<00:02:54.340> about<00:02:54.750> its<00:02:55.750> Manic<00:02:56.170> Panic<00:02:56.320> and

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
found out about its Manic Panic and

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.470 
found out about its Manic Panic and
dreamtone<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.709> virgin<00:03:00.489> white<00:03:01.239> is

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
dreamtone and it's in virgin white is

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.100 
dreamtone and it's in virgin white is
white<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.730> no<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:04.209> just<00:03:04.450> slap<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.930> on

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
white and no you don't just slap this on

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.460 
white and no you don't just slap this on
because<00:03:05.380> um<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:07.000> got<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> weird<00:03:07.840> texture<00:03:08.260> to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
because um it's got a weird texture to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.039 
because um it's got a weird texture to
it<00:03:08.500> by<00:03:08.709> itself<00:03:09.100> but<00:03:09.610> when<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.030> add<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> any

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
it by itself but when you add it to any

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.130 
it by itself but when you add it to any
liquid<00:03:11.980> foundation<00:03:12.459> that<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:13.030> typically<00:03:14.019> use

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
liquid foundation that you typically use

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.490 
liquid foundation that you typically use
it<00:03:14.769> will<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:16.000> lighten<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.320> add

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
it will just lighten it and you can add

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.319 
it will just lighten it and you can add
as<00:03:17.680> much<00:03:17.920> or<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.400> little<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.850> want<00:03:18.880> to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
as much or as little as you want to

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.430 
as much or as little as you want to
until<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.630> get<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> color<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.350> want

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
until you get the color that you want

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.229 
until you get the color that you want
and<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.989> me<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.350> about<00:03:23.760> half<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
and for me it's about half of this and

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.150 
and for me it's about half of this and
half<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:27.090> my<00:03:28.090> usual<00:03:28.299> liquid<00:03:28.930> foundation<00:03:29.890> to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
half of my usual liquid foundation to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.930 
half of my usual liquid foundation to
get<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.549> color<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.000> need<00:03:31.239> but

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
get the color that I need but

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.050 
get the color that I need but
it's<00:03:32.090> great<00:03:32.750> coverage<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:34.190> does<00:03:34.460> make<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
it's great coverage it does make the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.710 
it's great coverage it does make the
foundation<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.840> bit<00:03:35.990> thicker<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:38.030> spreads

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
foundation a bit thicker but it spreads

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.550 
foundation a bit thicker but it spreads
out<00:03:38.900> really<00:03:39.760> thinly<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.870> don't<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.410> to

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
out really thinly and so I don't have to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.490 
out really thinly and so I don't have to
use<00:03:42.770> more<00:03:43.100> than<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:43.670> one<00:03:44.420> light<00:03:44.870> covering<00:03:45.380> of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
use more than just one light covering of

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.580 
use more than just one light covering of
this<00:03:46.000> with<00:03:47.000> my<00:03:47.180> bare<00:03:47.360> minerals<00:03:47.600> on<00:03:47.930> top<00:03:48.170> so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
this with my bare minerals on top so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.540 
this with my bare minerals on top so
this<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.580> truly<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.510> lifesaver<00:03:51.160> Kat<00:03:52.160> Von<00:03:52.340> D's
