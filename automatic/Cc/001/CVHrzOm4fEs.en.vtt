but um yeah just fold it in half and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.750 
but um yeah just fold it in half and
then<00:00:48.350> again<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.920> depends<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.520> size<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

want it's Amaral but just keep folding
until<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.789> something<00:01:00.000> similar<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and just simply fold it in half or just

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.740 
and just simply fold it in half or just
bend<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.140> you're<00:01:07.140> done<00:01:08.450> made<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.479> it
