okay well I'm looking at the new hall
and<00:00:05.120> this<00:00:06.120> one's<00:00:06.390> too<00:00:06.600> small<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:07.200> me<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> 86

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
and this one's too small for me the 86

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.570 
and this one's too small for me the 86
th<00:00:08.400> 80/60<00:00:09.210> wind<00:00:09.389> grower<00:00:10.130> basically<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
th 80/60 wind grower basically this is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.740 
th 80/60 wind grower basically this is
identical<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.360> uh<00:00:16.160> yeah<00:00:17.449> my<00:00:18.449> case

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
identical to my to my uh yeah my case

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
identical to my to my uh yeah my case
the<00:00:19.199> only<00:00:19.380> difference<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.609> lower

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the only difference is this is the lower

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.349 
the only difference is this is the lower
horsepower<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.480> 80<00:00:21.720> 80<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> 80<00:00:22.590> 90<00:00:23.160> 80<00:00:24.090> 80

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
horsepower to 80 80 or the 80 90 80 80

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.029 
horsepower to 80 80 or the 80 90 80 80
not<00:00:24.869> 80<00:00:25.080> 90<00:00:25.529> 80<00:00:25.740> 80<00:00:26.039> 80<00:00:26.279> 80<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.810> as

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
not 80 90 80 80 80 80 is the same as

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.479 
not 80 90 80 80 80 80 is the same as
what<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.830> one's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.460> little

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
what I have this one's just a little

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
what I have this one's just a little
less<00:00:32.820> horsepower<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.600> still<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
less horsepower it still has all the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
less horsepower it still has all the
same<00:00:34.559> stuff<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:35.969> looks<00:00:36.059> like

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
same stuff this one actually looks like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
same stuff this one actually looks like
a<00:00:36.300> left<00:00:36.630> over<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.280> changed<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> hub

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
a left over I changed the hub

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.040 
a left over I changed the hub
manufacturer<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> could<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
manufacturer I could see that

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.980 
manufacturer I could see that
this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
this

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.810 
this
this<00:00:44.530> here<00:00:44.770> looks<00:00:45.010> like<00:00:45.070> it's<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.460> hell<00:00:45.610> of<00:00:45.640> a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
this here looks like it's a hell of a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
this here looks like it's a hell of a
lot<00:00:46.000> easier<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:49.650> wow<00:00:50.970> what<00:00:51.970> model<00:00:52.150> header<00:00:52.600> is

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
lot easier to wow what model header is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.990 
lot easier to wow what model header is
this<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:53.710> header<00:00:53.950> sticks<00:00:54.340> out<00:00:54.520> by<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.850> way

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
this this header sticks out by the way

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.680 
this this header sticks out by the way
is<00:00:55.060> farther

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
is farther

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.490 
is farther
this<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:56.960> 416

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
this is a 416

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.350 
this is a 416
my<00:01:00.500> model<00:01:01.220> year<00:01:01.460> May<00:01:02.180> 2013

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
my model year May 2013

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.649 
my model year May 2013
yeah

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.450 

I<00:01:07.719> would<00:01:07.899> really<00:01:08.109> like<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.619> have<00:01:08.829> on<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.219> front

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
I would really like to have on the front

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.760 
I would really like to have on the front
of<00:01:09.549> mine<00:01:11.759> yes<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:13.539> see<00:01:13.749> that<00:01:13.990> they<00:01:14.229> they

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
of mine yes you see that they they

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.740 
of mine yes you see that they they
change<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.429> there's<00:01:15.640> no<00:01:15.789> more<00:01:15.969> crop<00:01:16.270> lifters

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
change that there's no more crop lifters

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.679 
change that there's no more crop lifters
on<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:17.140> either<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.850> good<00:01:19.149> thing<00:01:19.179> I

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
on this either which is a good thing I

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.080 
on this either which is a good thing I
really<00:01:20.259> like<00:01:20.439> this<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.990> wider<00:01:23.259> cut<00:01:23.969> seems<00:01:24.969> to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
really like this it's wider cut seems to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.929 
really like this it's wider cut seems to
sit<00:01:25.299> farther<00:01:25.600> forward<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.429> isn't<00:01:27.670> so

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
sit farther forward that this isn't so

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.089 
sit farther forward that this isn't so
close<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.390> here

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.099 
close to here

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.010 
close to here
they<00:01:30.099> say<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.429> cab<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.880> bigger<00:01:31.119> but<00:01:31.719> I<00:01:31.810> think

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
they say the cab is bigger but I think

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.169 
they say the cab is bigger but I think
this<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.439> older<00:01:32.829> model<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.609> just<00:01:33.729> want<00:01:34.090> to

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
this is the older model I just want to

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.790 
this is the older model I just want to
take<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.329> quick<00:01:34.569> look<00:01:34.810> inside

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
take a quick look inside

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.790 
take a quick look inside
yeah<00:01:37.800> it's<00:01:38.250> identical<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.120> have

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
yeah it's identical to what I have

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.310 
yeah it's identical to what I have
there's<00:01:40.800> nothing<00:01:41.220> different<00:01:41.990> maybe<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> few

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there's nothing different maybe a few

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.980 
there's nothing different maybe a few
creature<00:01:43.650> comforts

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.560 

okay<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.620> tall<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> same<00:01:47.240> topspin<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.450> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
okay I'm tall the same topspin but it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.530 
okay I'm tall the same topspin but it's
not<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> clear<00:01:49.020> topspin<00:01:49.590> um<00:01:50.930> yeah

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
not a clear topspin um yeah

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.410 
not a clear topspin um yeah
vacuum<00:01:54.540> cleaner<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.080> same<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.070> rear

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
vacuum cleaner is the same on the rear

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.580 
vacuum cleaner is the same on the rear
tires<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.720> different<00:01:58.080> though<00:01:58.229> these<00:01:58.440> are

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
tires are different though these are

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
tires are different though these are
good<00:01:59.190> for<00:01:59.400> one<00:01:59.580> year<00:01:59.759> tires<00:02:01.159> 21<00:02:02.159> l<00:02:02.280> 28<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.500> should

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
good for one year tires 21 l 28 I should

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
good for one year tires 21 l 28 I should
get<00:02:04.650> those<00:02:04.800> for<00:02:05.100> mine<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.630> are

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
get those for mine because these are

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
get those for mine because these are
actually<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.619> better<00:02:07.890> than<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
actually a little bit better than the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.449 
actually a little bit better than the
ones<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:11.870> yeah<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.319> identical<00:02:13.770> no

rowing but this is the old model the
older<00:05:04.199> model<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.770> wouldn't<00:05:05.610> mind<00:05:05.759> having<00:05:06.000> this

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
older model I wouldn't mind having this

older model I wouldn't mind having this
if<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.660> could<00:05:06.840> remove<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:08.060> crusher<00:05:09.060> rolls<00:05:09.270> that

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
if I could remove the crusher rolls that

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.420 
if I could remove the crusher rolls that
would<00:05:09.570> take<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.720> lot<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.020> worse<00:05:10.199> power<00:05:10.470> that's

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
would take a lot of worse power that's

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.189 
would take a lot of worse power that's
what's<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.330> big<00:05:12.509> difference<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:12.990> mine

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
what's the the big difference in mine

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.270 
what's the the big difference in mine
this<00:05:13.440> is<00:05:13.500> all<00:05:13.770> open<00:05:14.280> or<00:05:14.430> all<00:05:14.729> closed<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.389> and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
this is all open or all closed in and

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.999 
this is all open or all closed in and
there's<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.810> this<00:05:18.810> messed<00:05:19.169> up<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.680> power

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
there's like this messed up to power

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.610 
there's like this messed up to power
take-off<00:05:20.460> shaft<00:05:20.520> feel<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:21.240> there<00:05:21.449> I<00:05:21.630> like<00:05:22.470> this

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
take-off shaft feel in there I like this

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.159 
take-off shaft feel in there I like this
idea<00:05:22.830> better<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.479> a<00:05:24.509> simple<00:05:24.840> fact<00:05:25.050> that

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
idea better this is a simple fact that

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.420 
idea better this is a simple fact that
all<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.500> crap<00:05:25.830> can<00:05:26.009> just<00:05:26.190> fall<00:05:26.400> through

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
all the crap can just fall through

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.219 
all the crap can just fall through
instead<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.240> building<00:05:27.750> up<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:27.990> there<00:05:28.110> and

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
instead of building up in there and

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.510 
instead of building up in there and
causing<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.680> problem<00:05:30.500> yeah<00:05:31.500> but<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.340> will

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
causing a problem yeah but this will

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.430 
causing a problem yeah but this will
mount<00:05:32.639> right<00:05:32.910> up<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.210> mine<00:05:33.389> if<00:05:33.539> I<00:05:33.660> needed<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.080> if
