of the meat out of the cantaloupe and
honeydew<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:12.210> but<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.600> don't<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.320> we

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
honeydew it but now we don't do that we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.300 
honeydew it but now we don't do that we
just<00:02:13.530> go<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.840> go<00:02:15.840> about<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.370> far

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
just go down and go about that far

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.210 
just go down and go about that far
now<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> turn<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.180> around<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.780> make<00:02:25.220> an

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
now you turn it around and you make an

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.440 
now you turn it around and you make an
incision<00:02:27.060> there<00:02:27.690> straight<00:02:28.320> down<00:02:29.300> another<00:02:30.300> one

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
incision there straight down another one

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.280 
incision there straight down another one
there<00:02:30.840> straight<00:02:31.530> down<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:34.020> what<00:02:34.140> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
there straight down and then what you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.940 
there straight down and then what you
have<00:02:34.910> are<00:02:35.910> pieces<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.660> lay<00:02:39.950> you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
have are pieces that you can lay you

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.949 
have are pieces that you can lay you
wouldn't<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.850> few<00:02:42.209> pieces<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.720> this

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
wouldn't just do a few pieces like this

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.960 
wouldn't just do a few pieces like this
if<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.500> were<00:02:43.620> making<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:44.070> fruit<00:02:44.340> platter<00:02:44.580> let's

you notice and then when you get to the
that<00:03:20.340> last<00:03:20.640> piece<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.909> this<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.959> easy

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.059 

let's<00:03:40.739> say<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.159> fruit<00:03:41.750> that's<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.069> fruit

let's say you have fruit that's a fruit

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
let's say you have fruit that's a fruit
platter<00:03:44.299> then<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.389> can<00:03:45.540> take<00:03:45.750> these<00:03:45.930> pieces

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
platter then you can take these pieces

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.280 
platter then you can take these pieces
and<00:03:47.090> let<00:03:48.090> them<00:03:48.180> fall<00:03:48.389> all<00:03:48.569> over<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.870> place<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
and let them fall all over the place and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.210 
and let them fall all over the place and
just<00:03:50.189> place<00:03:50.459> them<00:03:50.730> around<00:03:51.859> items<00:03:52.859> on<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220
