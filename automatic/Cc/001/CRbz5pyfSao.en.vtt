I think I did that the cage actually a

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.460 
I think I did that the cage actually a
couple<00:04:35.949> years<00:04:36.160> ago<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.430> think<00:04:36.699> 495<00:04:37.600> 414<00:04:38.320> or

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
couple years ago I think 495 414 or

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.350 
couple years ago I think 495 414 or
something<00:04:38.800> was<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.460> dropped<00:04:39.820> down<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.120> four<00:04:40.270> or

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
something was I dropped down the four or

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.420 
something was I dropped down the four or
five<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:41.320> shooting<00:04:41.949> for<00:04:42.070> twenty<00:04:42.280> five

five and I was shooting for twenty five

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.040 
five and I was shooting for twenty five
I<00:04:42.460> think<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.850> hit<00:04:42.940> like<00:04:43.060> nineteen<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.900> main

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
I think I hit like nineteen the main

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.520 
I think I hit like nineteen the main
thing<00:04:44.320> that<00:04:44.350> you'll<00:04:44.979> have<00:04:45.130> gains<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.240> just

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
thing that you'll have gains on is just

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.670 
thing that you'll have gains on is just
nothing<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:48.030> crazy<00:04:49.030> volume<00:04:49.380> blood<00:04:50.380> flow

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
nothing but just crazy volume blood flow

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.310 
nothing but just crazy volume blood flow
and<00:04:50.919> just<00:04:50.979> just<00:04:51.699> makes<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.260> much

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
and just just makes it just that much

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:44.010 
and just just makes it just that much
harder

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.189 

I've<00:05:45.820> always<00:05:46.820> been<00:05:47.000> a<00:05:47.060> tricep<00:05:47.509> venture<00:05:47.840> so<00:05:48.020> my

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
last year and tearing my bicep tendon it

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.540 
last year and tearing my bicep tendon it
kind<00:05:53.330> of<00:05:53.419> switched<00:05:53.690> super<00:05:54.320> setting<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.830> ISIS

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.350 

I<00:06:28.780> started<00:06:29.500> off<00:06:29.620> as<00:06:29.800> a<00:06:29.830> bodybuilder<00:06:30.130> I<00:06:30.520> think

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
I started off as a bodybuilder I think

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.470 
I started off as a bodybuilder I think
one<00:06:31.510> of<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.690> main<00:06:32.730> reasons<00:06:33.730> that<00:06:33.820> I'm<00:06:34.000> not<00:06:34.030> as

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
one of the main reasons that I'm not as

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.030

injured and not as battered as some
power<00:06:39.490> lifters<00:06:39.790> and<00:06:39.910> I<00:06:40.180> tried<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.840> make<00:06:40.960> sure

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
power lifters and I tried to make sure

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.590 
power lifters and I tried to make sure
that<00:06:41.170> I<00:06:41.350> stay<00:06:41.560> balanced<00:06:41.950> and<00:06:42.210> if<00:06:43.210> you<00:06:43.330> push

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
that I stay balanced and if you push

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.760 
that I stay balanced and if you push
what<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:43.900> pull<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.350> you're<00:06:44.440> gonna<00:06:44.530> stay

what you pull and you're gonna stay

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.100 
what you pull and you're gonna stay
balanced<00:06:45.190> if<00:06:45.310> you<00:06:45.460> hit<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.390> superset<00:06:46.870> and

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
balanced if you hit the superset and

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.330

keep the volume behind everything you're

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.580 
keep the volume behind everything you're
just<00:06:48.460> going<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:48.610> be<00:06:48.700> more<00:06:49.480> well-rounded<00:06:50.020> and

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
just going to be more well-rounded and
