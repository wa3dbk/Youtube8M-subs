00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.390
 Syria 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.189
 supporters of Bashar al-Assad are preparing for 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.590
 possible military intervention with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.040
 Us parties are going to become alive 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.690
 by wall 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.420
 before the intended objects 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.369
 attacks they say they are ready to die 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.330
 unless of course forgotten at all 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.340
 strike at syria without this topic 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 a rare diplomatic meeting costs 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 so the way the general secretary says 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 Anders Fogh Rasmussen organizations 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 will not participate possible military 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.590
 stocks are a matter of individual countries but 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 despite this it is important to demonstrate 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 his reaction to the incident, some on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 this bill the secretary general no doubt me 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 provided irrefutable 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 evidence I am personally confident in this that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 Syrian chemical weapons used 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 Russian authorities meanwhile believe that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.620
 chimatake could well be a handiwork 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.710
 rebels if they are now supported by the us 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.460
 then it will be a fatal mistake if 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.260
 announced by the president of the united states 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.640
 all the same to the great regret of us all 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 it will take place in my opinion it is not 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 depending on the words that are spoken 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 about geneva-2 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 how to support those who oppose 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.939
 Assad regime without resorting to violence on 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 This was discussed at the meeting of the head of the mid 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.659
 Germany Guido Westerwelle with 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.090
 representatives of the Syrian opposition 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.030
 possible military action against damask 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.680
 Germany will not participate until now 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.930
 not developed a common position on this 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.759
 issue and in the Arab League 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 representatives of member countries this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.990
 organizations are united in the fact that the fault lies 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.350
 on the regime of assad legs of a military operation 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 here is skeptical 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 the government won't be able to constantly 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 defeat the insurgency Noi 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.659
 the rebels will not be able to forever whip 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 that frame 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.130
 about both sides of the whole table 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229
 negotiations it turns out that the Syrians 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 forced to take care of their own destiny 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 many prefer to leave the country with 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 the beginning of the conflict from Syria fled almost 2 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590
 million people
