the ground so you want him communicating

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:51.720 
the ground so you want him communicating

to the rest of the guys in the ball

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.919 
to the rest of the guys in the ball
comes<00:00:51.910> in<00:00:52.030> that's<00:00:52.329> quite<00:00:52.539> a<00:00:52.570> good<00:00:52.719> point

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
comes in that's quite a good point

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.389 
comes in that's quite a good point
because<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.289> hooker<00:00:53.530> can't<00:00:53.769> really<00:00:54.039> hook<00:00:54.250> now

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
because the hooker can't really hook now

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.799 
because the hooker can't really hook now
he<00:00:54.460> can't<00:00:54.730> lift<00:00:54.910> his<00:00:55.090> foot<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.359> under<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:55.690> much

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
he can't lift his foot is under so much

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.660 
he can't lift his foot is under so much
pressure<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.379> yet<00:00:56.800> you're<00:00:56.949> still<00:00:57.070> rolling

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
pressure and yet you're still rolling

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.759 
pressure and yet you're still rolling
the<00:00:58.059> ball<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.539> don't<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:59.079> anyone<00:00:59.320> put<00:00:59.679> the

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
the ball in I don't see anyone put the

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.990 
the ball in I don't see anyone put the
ball<00:00:59.949> in<00:01:00.070> with<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.219> little<00:01:00.309> bit<00:01:00.519> of<00:01:00.609> spin<00:01:00.820> and

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
ball in with a little bit of spin and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.939 
ball in with a little bit of spin and
bounce<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.480> flicks<00:01:01.719> in<00:01:01.899> illegal<00:01:02.469> ah

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
bounce so it flicks in illegal ah

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.340 
bounce so it flicks in illegal ah
I<00:01:03.640> think<00:01:04.030> referees<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.690> way<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.930> laws<00:01:05.110> have

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
I think referees the way the laws have

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.450 
I think referees the way the laws have
changed<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.830> that<00:01:05.890> they're<00:01:06.010> looking<00:01:06.100> for<00:01:06.280> a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
changed and that they're looking for a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.430 
changed and that they're looking for a
really<00:01:06.730> straight<00:01:07.060> feed<00:01:07.330> I<00:01:07.540> think<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.230> you<00:01:08.290> put

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
really straight feed I think if you put

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960 
really straight feed I think if you put
a<00:01:08.470> bit<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.710> spin<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.190> it's<00:01:09.280> gonna<00:01:09.430> gonna

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
a bit of spin on and it's gonna gonna

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.090 
a bit of spin on and it's gonna gonna
skew<00:01:10.330> into<00:01:10.480> your<00:01:10.930> own<00:01:11.050> side<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.590> your<00:01:11.710> risky

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
skew into your own side and your risky

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.470 
skew into your own side and your risky
giving<00:01:12.280> away<00:01:12.400> free<00:01:12.670> okay<00:01:12.970> let's<00:01:13.180> go<00:01:13.300> through

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
giving away free okay let's go through

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.090 
giving away free okay let's go through
this<00:01:13.570> scenario<00:01:13.720> now<00:01:14.080> then<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.620> balls<00:01:14.860> at<00:01:15.010> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
this scenario now then the balls at the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800 
this scenario now then the balls at the
base<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.580> six<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:16.000> trying<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.300> keep<00:01:16.450> me<00:01:16.660> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
base the six is trying to keep me the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.330 
base the six is trying to keep me the
defensive<00:01:17.320> nine<00:01:17.500> off<00:01:17.680> you're<00:01:18.130> obviously

close it Kenny no no you can see you can
scoot<00:02:06.100> in<00:02:06.220> there<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.700> he's<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.330> get<00:02:07.450> in

line<00:02:07.780> with<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:08.020> number<00:02:08.259> eight<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.560> doesn't

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
line with a number eight so that doesn't

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.009 
line with a number eight so that doesn't
give<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.129> a<00:02:09.160> channel<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> get<00:02:09.939> into<00:02:10.209> so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
give you a channel to get into so

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.539 
give you a channel to get into so
ultimately<00:02:11.409> then<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.829> want<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.219> number<00:02:12.459> eight

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
ultimately then I want the number eight

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.550 
ultimately then I want the number eight
to<00:02:12.730> get<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.299> ball<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.750> far<00:02:13.989> over<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.469> right

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
to get the ball as far over to the right

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.070 
to get the ball as far over to the right
hand

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
hand

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.700 
hand
as<00:02:15.650> he<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.430> not<00:02:17.420> extend<00:02:17.900> his<00:02:18.290> legs<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
as he can and not extend his legs so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.010 
as he can and not extend his legs so
much<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.070> if<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.550> keep<00:02:20.030> keeps<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> ball<00:02:20.780> in

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
much so if you keep keeps the ball in

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.380 
much so if you keep keeps the ball in
here<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.890> keeps<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.400> from<00:02:22.580> being<00:02:22.970> able<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.270> get

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
here it keeps you from being able to get

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
here it keeps you from being able to get
around<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:23.990> trapeze<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.070> send<00:02:25.340> my<00:02:25.490> feet

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
around and a trapeze when I send my feet

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.400 
around and a trapeze when I send my feet
in<00:02:25.970> defensively<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:27.020> about<00:02:27.200> what's<00:02:27.350> your

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
in defensively what about what's your

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.810 
in defensively what about what's your
thoughts<00:02:27.530> about<00:02:27.860> dropping<00:02:28.400> off<00:02:28.490> we've<00:02:28.670> seen<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
thoughts about dropping off we've seen a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.460 
thoughts about dropping off we've seen a
lot<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.030> scrum<00:02:29.330> hubs<00:02:29.510> now<00:02:29.750> drop<00:02:29.990> off<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.350> wait

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
lot of scrum hubs now drop off and wait

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.110 
lot of scrum hubs now drop off and wait
for<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.710> scoop<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.220> didn't<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.970> that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
for the scoop I didn't really like that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.430 
for the scoop I didn't really like that
as<00:02:32.270> an<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.570> thought<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.020> put<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> bit<00:02:33.320> more

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
as an I thought it put a bit more

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.860 
as an I thought it put a bit more
pressure<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.770> my<00:02:33.890> eight<00:02:34.040> yeah<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:35.030> does<00:02:35.210> and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pressure on my eight yeah it does and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.840 
pressure on my eight yeah it does and
he's<00:02:36.080> quite<00:02:36.320> he's<00:02:36.800> blind<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.340> situation

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
he's quite he's blind in that situation

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.250 
he's quite he's blind in that situation
his<00:02:37.970> head<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.240> stuck<00:02:38.450> between<00:02:38.600> two<00:02:38.840> second

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
his head is stuck between two second

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650 
his head is stuck between two second
rows<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> think<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:40.700> based<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
rows but I think it's it's based on the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.870 
rows but I think it's it's based on the
wheel<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.020> scrum<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.130> scrum<00:02:43.460> is

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
wheel of the scrum so if the scrum is

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.940 
wheel of the scrum so if the scrum is
going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.240> wheel<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.540> way<00:02:44.750> into<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.140> you're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
going to wheel this way into you you're
