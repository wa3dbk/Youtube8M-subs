00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.270
 Dear youtube friends, you mean - and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 Now there is another episode of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.530
 Sirius says this time not on the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 Wednesday evening as usual but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.990
 on sunday morning from current occasion 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.359
 because last night was the web video 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 has awarded under collegiate 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.039
 boss pretty much everything perfect and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 disassembled what you could fuck z how to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.269
 probably in the genre that way 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.949
 would express yes and I have mine 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.840
 actually thought human that is one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.040
 Great thing for a serious says in the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.540
 Review I've already got that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100
 first critical video made to where 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.960
 i said manchester in the system where 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 Everyone calls to click every day 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 Somehow I'm pretty open 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.300
 but nevertheless it is so 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.399
 also a little bit a fan 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 Price remained and colleague then only 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 once again shown how much that too 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.480
 so colleague has been in was in three 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 categories nominated in triple 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 in epik and in you i so a category 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.980
 for newbies and beginners and he has 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.989
 really all three categories 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 won rigorously and indeed and triple 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 play and epik with a music video 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 you just say that and in jubi 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.439
 he has a teaser section as it were 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.299
 won in about 20 25 seconds long 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.880
 is probably the last 20 seconds there 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.619
 I think subscribe and subscribe 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 but absolutely okay i would go now 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 the newbie category he moor at 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 what is it for a channel and whether now 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.509
 new content is coming and stuff and now 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 not at this single a video 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 namely that one video alone 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 you would have to say ey for one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 teaser old for a teaser you get 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 price is not at all yes but so if you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.280
 then look at the channel of colleague 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 I must look really say I have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.860
 I have in the last weeks times 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.850
 I made that, I think so 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 already told that I am in the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.070
 a little more with me last week 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.320
 other channels have been busy 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.780
 otherwise my style never was and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.770
 I have no idea how many 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.570
 there are videos but at least I have 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 80 percent now from the colleague videos 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.020
 seen in the last few weeks 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.229
 youtube and they really are real 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.479
 I have to say really without exception he 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.890
 make stories like the people 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.509
 can order his clothes and yes 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.129
 He turns us on postman and then leaves 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.009
 then, and brings the past he himself 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.100
 His late night also does everything 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.180
 made all really cool 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.100
 I do not want to say that but that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.380
 is rather so intellectual and and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.490
 sympathetic yes so now im 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.440
 Contrary to the texts it is somehow 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.640
 style actually has style 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.100
 not that the lyrics are not a style now 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.670
 have but the lyrics are so text is yes 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.720
 just smart pump gun and band and one 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.210
 show it all comes up a bit 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.800
 smarter and i just have to say that 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.730
 colleague on youtube power is actually 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.470
 really cool 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 yes and for that he has in any case price 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.580
 It deserves to be easy and alone 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.650
 a little bit difficult since he 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.230
 almost a purely commercial one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.770
 offer that means Kollegah is easy 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.870
 in germany a music star and the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.020
 which in turn is with people 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.570
 as I do not know now do not say it now 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.100
 normal youtube and normal youtuber 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.660
 yes, people are like the outsiders and 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.340
 hole is actually no longer the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.210
 are already so far away in everything 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 they are gone but they are hovering 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.880
 come from youtube and join us 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.100
 youtube grew up and is kollegah 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.480
 Now a type of stop with his music 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.950
 Mega is successful and I think 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.830
 To be right boss is an absolute hammer 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 awesome album and he comes in now 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.240
 scene and always admits it as 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.150
 Of course, his fanbase will migrate away 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.440
 bring his post ii with it and keep that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.490
 I at least rudimentary for one 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.300
 a bit difficult that he then at 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.740
 winning triple and epik is also 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.810
 okay the one category he was his 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.370
 Music video category and the video is 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.730
 I'm fine, too, and I think so too 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.810
 really been a pure special so 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.860
 now do not hit me dead that was 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.780
 I really do not think so now 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.250
 his something facebook fan or something 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.720
 have you made your own video and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.220
 uploaded on youtube and there are 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.860
 otherwise not that is not on the album 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.840
 On it I find that somehow okay 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.010
 Overall, the show is so small 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.209
 bit over that the kid laid now 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 probably everyone is waiting 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.320
 that I'm on the tail 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.459
 down joke somehow the pants down 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.800
 joke if you take the tail of his 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.300
 buddy could see a go that's me 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.560
 actually jacket like pants that was now 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.080
 not that special final 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.520
 show but I did not care anyways 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.070
 a bit problematic I think that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.840
 with the tail out that the only one 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.270
 what the established media 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.830
 I say like star online 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.910
 they like the web video 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.830
 price report that are apparently 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.009
 very interwoven 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.840
 the only thing that what the normal 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.139
 press about it now or report 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.550
 what will be remembered there is 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.430
 Colleague of the rapper wins the youtube 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.189
 Price and his buddy shows his cock 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.349
 Well thank you so I do not know 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.849
 whether that 's us youtuber now 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.930
 did well on the 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.580
 the other side we can not stop anymore 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.319
 change and the thing is now somehow 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.810
 through the web video price show itself 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.639
 was the absolute burner so that was 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.139
 really next level and they have that 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.719
 really raised to the area where it is 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.129
 absolutely perfect entertainment was the 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.240
 moderator by first said 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.740
 human did he have to someone out now 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.270
 come to the television and so could 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.969
 not nobody from youtube or theirs that 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.090
 is an event was from youtube 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.639
 for youtube and stuff i have to say 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.060
 joko klaas did a great job 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.000
 really cool 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.590
 they are so yes because they are not 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.240
 they pulled it loose 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.710
 also so improvised and such 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.750
 I really liked stories 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.460
 By and large, that's how it is 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.169
 keep a little thread of taste 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 that has won three awards colleague 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.219
 not because I do not like him but 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.719
 Simply because you may have this 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.919
 web video price again very small 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.719
 should rethink with his 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.629
 categories with his nominated and 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.629
 with the options you there so 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:37.979
 maybe you would have to for such 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.930
 professional commercial offers 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.419
 like colleague own category 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.000
 create or somehow a bar 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.669
 to suggest that they say yes you can 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.870
 always with only one video per category 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.190
 were nominated without ball 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.120
 Kollegah probably with his other 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.229
 He really does not do that either 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.770
 are bad and then the next 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.449
 won prizes 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.120
 So somehow I would me about the 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.469
 web video prize jury not from the jury 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.360
 have nothing to do with it but from 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.629
 the events wish that themselves 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.629
 there for the web video award 2015 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.699
 it is considered how to put it into one 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:12.569
 Category can bring that the 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.279
 other normal youtuber not too much 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.110
 disadvantaged, I now think so 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.400
 my area 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.659
 besides, I just have to say look 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
 Boss I think lately 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.009
 experienced more often and so and salad 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.870
 is the biceps shrink he has too 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.849
 Finally, what said it at the third 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.319
 Price has come to the stage and there 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.419
 really came from the audience 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.370
 no more applause but people have 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.259
 just booked yes and he has 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.360
 said something like yes, I think I 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.340
 I have a danger here now 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.629
 that made and so people but so much 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.129
 at training like today I had to 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.099
 then go up the stairs and me 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.349
 At least that's what it's all about 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.819
 everything not understood at all because it 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.030
 is also so videos on youtube bus 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.340
 goes around because so few and trained 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.199
 just keep your chest and biceps and then you're there 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.849
 Also this video where he tried legs 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.229
 to train and always group with the 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.659
 basic then comes around the corner as soon as 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.340
 then the leg press is and that was 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.280
 already in everything, I think 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.810
 so many did not understand that 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.280
 first conclusion of me to the web video price 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.800
 but it was just a great one 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.629

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.159

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.520
 I have to be thrown off course 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:18.199

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.569

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.529
 to listen to the individual categories 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:23.029
 or if I'm a little bit more 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.289
 then you can say that 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.180
 write in the video comments 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:29.900
 otherwise that was mine for now 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.509
