and you know what if we don't do it who
will<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.780> that's<00:04:47.780> why<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:48.260> do<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.470> if<00:04:49.220> not<00:04:49.610> us

who if not now when I guess that's the
stage<00:04:53.510> but<00:04:54.110> anyway<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:54.500> that's<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:55.040> little<00:04:55.160> bit

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
stage but anyway so that's a little bit

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.210 
stage but anyway so that's a little bit
about<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.760> horses<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.270> Tierra<00:04:56.600> madre<00:04:57.220> they're
