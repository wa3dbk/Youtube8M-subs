anti-aliasing<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.419> to<00:03:13.989> me<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.349> really<00:03:14.530> does

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
anti-aliasing and to me it really does

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.129 
anti-aliasing and to me it really does
add<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.129> that<00:03:15.280> cinematic<00:03:15.669> feel<00:03:16.049> speaking<00:03:17.049> of

something as simple as climbing a Ledge
felt<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:30.820> rigid<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.479> if<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.020> had<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.349> press<00:04:32.560> X<00:04:32.860> in

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
felt so rigid is if I had to press X in

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.129 
felt so rigid is if I had to press X in
just<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.550> right<00:04:33.699> spot<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.270> push<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.930> stick

the<00:04:41.380> biggest<00:04:41.560> issue<00:04:41.830> with<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.099> gameplay<00:04:42.430> are

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
the biggest issue with the gameplay are

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.550 
the biggest issue with the gameplay are
the<00:04:42.700> stealth<00:04:43.000> sections<00:04:43.510> if<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:44.110> get<00:04:44.260> spotted

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
the stealth sections if you get spotted

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560 
the stealth sections if you get spotted
just<00:04:44.830> once<00:04:45.159> you<00:04:45.490> are<00:04:45.639> instantly

just once you are instantly

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.660 
just once you are instantly
this<00:04:47.200> would<00:04:47.380> be<00:04:47.500> kind<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:47.920> okay<00:04:48.070> if<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.490> could

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
this would be kind of okay if you could

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.580 
this would be kind of okay if you could
reasonably<00:04:49.150> dispatch<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.720> enemies<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.470> they

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
reasonably dispatch the enemies but they

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.080 
reasonably dispatch the enemies but they
seem<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.800> catch<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.220> at<00:04:51.340> unfair<00:04:51.700> vantage

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
there's a difference between challenging

there's a difference between challenging

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
and frustrating and the stealth here is

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.480 
and frustrating and the stealth here is
definitely<00:05:01.510> frustrating<00:05:02.500> QuickTime<00:05:03.160> events

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
definitely frustrating QuickTime events
