 no guys is very good is a mini game 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.339
 to have fun this is about 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:26.629
 I will explain more basic basically what 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:27.829
 it's about this one has that there's a 22 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.779
 players that one called the 

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:33.259
 hunter and another that is called the hunter and 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.999
 good guys the married one is the one who is going to 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.729
 go running down a series of paths 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:39.619
 while the hunter throws arrows 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.800
 from one from a distance 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:45.199
 considerable not and already if the hunter if the 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.929
 married rather survive it becomes 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.479
 in the hunter and if the hunter kill him 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:53.540
 because the hunter has to kill him if 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:56.810
 the hunter is killed by this one 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.000
 it has to be married not good 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.620
 guys is a series of things and the 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.590
 instructions are already inside the map 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.450

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.370
