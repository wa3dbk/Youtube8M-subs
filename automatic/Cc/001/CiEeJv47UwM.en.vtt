00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.649 
the game quite a bit so it's more
focused<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.200> doing<00:01:46.920> combos<00:01:47.520> can't<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
focused on doing combos can't like you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
focused on doing combos can't like you
might<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> combo<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> use<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
might do a combo then you use like a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.510 
might do a combo then you use like a
like<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> Roman<00:01:51.149> cancel<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
like a Roman cancel then you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
like a Roman cancel then you
the<00:01:52.579> combo<00:01:52.969> rather<00:01:53.149> than<00:01:53.359> oh<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.109> combo

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the combo rather than oh I do a combo

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.889 
the combo rather than oh I do a combo
and<00:01:54.619> then<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.799> do<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> super<00:01:55.280> move<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
and then I do a super move so as it is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.649 
and then I do a super move so as it is
it's<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.439> more<00:01:57.649> stripped<00:01:58.130> back<00:01:58.369> guilty<00:01:59.149> gear<00:01:59.420> or

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
it's a more stripped back guilty gear or

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.899 
it's a more stripped back guilty gear or
more<00:02:00.049> stripped<00:02:00.289> back<00:02:00.409> from<00:02:00.950> later<00:02:01.579> blades

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
more stripped back from later blades

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.450 
more stripped back from later blades
blues<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.869> still<00:02:03.259> feel<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:03.740> legitimate<00:02:04.369> I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
blues but I still feel it's legitimate I

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.850 
blues but I still feel it's legitimate I
still<00:02:04.700> feel<00:02:04.909> it's<00:02:05.060> really<00:02:05.299> fun<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:06.170> think<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
still feel it's really fun I think the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
still feel it's really fun I think the
game<00:02:07.039> looks<00:02:07.490> great<00:02:07.759> plays<00:02:08.119> great<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.690> roster

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
game looks great plays great the roster

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.449 
game looks great plays great the roster
of<00:02:09.319> course<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.739> smaller<00:02:09.979> from<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.220> later

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
of course is smaller from the later

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.309 
of course is smaller from the later
guilty<00:02:10.789> games<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.269> again<00:02:11.450> they're<00:02:11.599> doing<00:02:11.810> you

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
guilty games but again they're doing you

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.960 
guilty games but again they're doing you
