for<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> couple<00:01:59.280> seconds<00:02:02.540> see<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.750> can't<00:02:03.960> do

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
for a couple seconds see if we can't do

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
for a couple seconds see if we can't do
that<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:06.799> well<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> really

detailed it's got let's see how many

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.990 
detailed it's got let's see how many
points<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.819> articulation<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.720> got

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
points of articulation it's got

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.040 
points of articulation it's got
one<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.450> hand<00:02:16.460> two<00:02:19.400> three<00:02:20.400> four<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.840> got

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
one in this hand two three four it's got

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.220 
one in this hand two three four it's got
two<00:02:22.260> different<00:02:22.410> waste<00:02:22.790> one<00:02:23.790> there<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.990> one

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
two different waste one there then one

get the box maybe just check it's all
around<00:02:46.290> here<00:02:46.440> somewhere<00:03:04.700> yeah<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
around here somewhere yeah here it is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.880 
around here somewhere yeah here it is
here's<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> box<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:13.310> um<00:03:15.110> 10<00:03:16.110> halo<00:03:16.470> points

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
here's the box for it um 10 halo points

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:28.850 
here's the box for it um 10 halo points
uh<00:03:20.630> see<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:21.810> can't<00:03:21.990> find<00:03:22.820> articulation<00:03:27.860> I'm

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
uh see if we can't find articulation I'm

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.490 
uh see if we can't find articulation I'm
being<00:03:29.310> lazy<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.790> can't<00:03:30.360> i<00:03:30.510> don't<00:03:30.600> i<00:03:31.050> don't<00:03:31.200> want

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
being lazy I can't i don't i don't want

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.660 
being lazy I can't i don't i don't want
to<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.920> look<00:03:32.160> real<00:03:32.430> hard<00:03:32.610> i'm<00:03:33.300> being<00:03:33.600> lazy

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
to really look real hard i'm being lazy

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.430 
to really look real hard i'm being lazy
so<00:03:37.100> yeah<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.430> think<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.630> 10<00:03:40.050> points<00:03:40.410> of

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
so yeah I think it's like 10 points of

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.320 
so yeah I think it's like 10 points of
