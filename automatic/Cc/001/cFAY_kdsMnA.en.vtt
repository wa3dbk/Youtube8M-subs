the<00:01:53.979> back<00:01:54.160> of<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.399> controller

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.680 

and<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.250> got<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.400> big<00:02:03.580> welding<00:02:04.000> transformer

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
and it's got a big welding transformer

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.300 
and it's got a big welding transformer
underneath<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.380> current<00:02:05.740> for<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.010> for

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310

the<00:02:06.370> motor<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.510> just<00:02:07.720> paralleled<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
the motor and I just paralleled the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.510 
the motor and I just paralleled the
IceCube<00:02:09.490> relays<00:02:09.850> for<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> little<00:02:10.330> starter<00:02:11.520> so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
IceCube relays for the little starter so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.610 
IceCube relays for the little starter so
