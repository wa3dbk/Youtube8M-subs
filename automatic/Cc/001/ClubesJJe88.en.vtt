to<00:00:19.650> talk<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> greatest<00:00:20.250> overclocking

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029

to talk about the greatest overclocking
software<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> hardware

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
software out there and hardware

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.529 
software out there and hardware
monitoring<00:00:23.220> software<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.939> well<00:00:23.970> I'm<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.480> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
monitoring software as well I'm going to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
monitoring software as well I'm going to
start<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.810> prime95<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:25.890> basically<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
start with prime95 which basically it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
start with prime95 which basically it
stresses<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.170> T<00:00:28.439> CPU<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:30.689> puts<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.199> full

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
stresses your T CPU it puts it at full

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.920 
stresses your T CPU it puts it at full
load<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.160> you'll<00:00:32.460> test<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:32.969> cores<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
load and you'll test all your cores and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680 
load and you'll test all your cores and
it<00:00:34.680> puts<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> put<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.030> puts<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.480> under

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
it puts a put it just puts a lot under

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
it puts a put it just puts a lot under
it<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:37.980> sure<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it and so it just to make sure you are

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.959 
it and so it just to make sure you are
actually<00:00:39.809> stable<00:00:40.469> alright<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.430> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
actually stable alright here we go this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.020 
actually stable alright here we go this
is<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> comes<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> open<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is when it comes the when you open the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
is when it comes the when you open the
program<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> comes<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.230> flat<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
program when it comes with flat out is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
program when it comes with flat out is
basically<00:00:47.579> being<00:00:47.850> used<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.600> blend<00:00:50.059> test<00:00:51.059> some

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
basically being used to blend test some

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
basically being used to blend test some
of<00:00:51.360> everything<00:00:51.629> lots<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> RAM<00:00:52.590> tested<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> uses

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of everything lots of RAM tested it uses

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
of everything lots of RAM tested it uses
a<00:00:53.550> bunch<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.270> RAM<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> puts<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.110> CPU<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a bunch of RAM and it puts your CPU at a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
a bunch of RAM and it puts your CPU at a
hundred<00:00:55.920> percent<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
hundred percent so if you have this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
hundred percent so if you have this
running<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.289> many<00:00:58.710> things<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
running there's not many things you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.849 
running there's not many things you
should<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.699> shouldn't<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.030> doing<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.420> much

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
should you shouldn't be doing that much

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.020 
should you shouldn't be doing that much
so<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.039> look<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:03.049> is<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.670> right<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so if you look here is it right now it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
so if you look here is it right now it
looks<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.570> only<00:01:06.659> running<00:01:06.960> three

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
looks like it's only running three

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
looks like it's only running three
threads<00:01:08.090> well<00:01:09.090> yeah<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:11.790> shouldn't<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.350> ok<00:01:13.350> but

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
threads well yeah it shouldn't be ok but

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.910 
threads well yeah it shouldn't be ok but
it<00:01:13.799> does<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.189> uh<00:01:15.049> these<00:01:16.049> tests<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> just

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it does these uh these tests and just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
it does these uh these tests and just
benchmarks<00:01:17.729> benchmarks<00:01:18.270> benchmarks<00:01:18.840> usually

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
benchmarks benchmarks benchmarks usually

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
benchmarks benchmarks benchmarks usually
to<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> stable<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> run<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.869> pin

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to get it stable you want to run for pin

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
to get it stable you want to run for pin
many<00:01:22.680> people<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> suggest<00:01:23.549> menu<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:24.540> some

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
many people to suggest menu for now some

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.310 
many people to suggest menu for now some
people<00:01:24.900> say<00:01:25.049> 24<00:01:25.740> hours<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> run<00:01:26.729> this

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
people say 24 hours you got to run this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.340 
people say 24 hours you got to run this
person<00:01:28.320> I'd<00:01:28.439> say<00:01:28.619> eight<00:01:29.460> maybe<00:01:30.350> personally

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
here and a start under task manager you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
here and a start under task manager you
can't<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.829> my<00:01:41.250> CPU<00:01:41.610> load<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> 100<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.420> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
can't see my CPU load is 100 and my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.440 
can't see my CPU load is 100 and my
physical<00:01:43.049> memories<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.530> 30<00:01:43.920> 63<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.299> gone

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
physical memories at 30 63 now it's gone

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
physical memories at 30 63 now it's gone
down<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.040> want<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
the things that your motherboard
actually<00:01:57.509> reads<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:58.770> show<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
actually reads it will show you

I've seen a negative 13 volts on the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.969 
I've seen a negative 13 volts on the
rail<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.200> 12<00:02:04.409> volt<00:02:04.469> rail<00:02:04.770> which<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
rail on the 12 volt rail which is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.229 
rail on the 12 volt rail which is
obviously<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.820> true<00:02:07.190> but<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:09.000> generally

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
obviously not true but but generally

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
obviously not true but but generally
with<00:02:09.720> these<00:02:09.899> core<00:02:10.200> temps<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
with these core temps actually all the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
with these core temps actually all the
time<00:02:11.849> for<00:02:12.180> me<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.599> core<00:02:12.840> temps<00:02:13.110> they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
time for me with these core temps they

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.610 
time for me with these core temps they
are

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
are

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.360 
are
the<00:02:13.920> GPU<00:02:14.340> temps<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:14.909> always<00:02:15.209> correct<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:17.129> is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
the GPU temps are always correct this is

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.309 
the GPU temps are always correct this is
these<00:02:17.700> temperature<00:02:18.269> pins<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.140> one

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
these temperature pins I know this one

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.630 
these temperature pins I know this one
is<00:02:19.349> my<00:02:19.530> Northbridge<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.519> my

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
is my Northbridge that's probably my

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
is my Northbridge that's probably my
Southbridge<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:22.080> probably<00:02:22.379> just<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
Southbridge that's probably just a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
Southbridge that's probably just a
system<00:02:23.220> cooler<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.239> not<00:02:24.420> sure<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> know

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
system cooler I'm not sure but I know

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.559 
system cooler I'm not sure but I know
that's<00:02:25.080> Northridge<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:25.799> sure<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.269> here's

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
that's Northridge for sure and so here's

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.350 
that's Northridge for sure and so here's
CPU<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.140> zine<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.310> tells<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.790> many<00:02:30.090> things

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
CPU I zine this tells you many things

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.369 
CPU I zine this tells you many things
about<00:02:30.480> your<00:02:30.690> CPU<00:02:31.230> your<00:02:32.150> graphics<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.870> memory

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
about your CPU your graphics your memory

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.789 
about your CPU your graphics your memory
and<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.069> motherboard<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:36.390> tells<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
and your motherboard this tells you the

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.410 
and your motherboard this tells you the
frequency<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.099> run<00:02:38.340> out<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:38.670> all<00:02:38.879> these

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
frequency you run out your all these

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630 
frequency you run out your all these
valuable<00:02:39.950> valuable<00:02:40.950> things<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.340> if<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.519> got

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
valuable valuable things so if you got

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.190 
valuable valuable things so if you got
an<00:02:41.760> overclock<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.510> pop<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.870> open<00:02:43.049> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
an overclock you can pop this open and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.690 
an overclock you can pop this open and
see<00:02:43.319> exactly<00:02:43.709> what<00:02:43.890> frequency<00:02:44.549> you're

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
see exactly what frequency you're

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.869 
see exactly what frequency you're
running<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.120> your<00:02:45.629> multipliers<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.470> not<00:02:46.950> this

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
running at your multipliers but not this

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.500 
running at your multipliers but not this
shows<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.299> your<00:02:48.540> mainboard<00:02:49.970> your<00:02:50.970> chipset
