of<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> any<00:02:37.410> secrets<00:02:38.280> coming<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.580> yet<00:02:38.730> I'll

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
of it any secrets coming out yet I'll

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.180 
of it any secrets coming out yet I'll
come<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:39.990> my<00:02:40.110> side<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> lads<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.920> got

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
come at my side and the lads have got

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
come at my side and the lads have got
I'm<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.459> quite<00:02:41.640> sure<00:02:41.670> I'm<00:02:42.060> fitted<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> thought

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I'm not quite sure I'm fitted in thought

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.690 
I'm not quite sure I'm fitted in thought
that<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> captain's<00:02:43.950> originally<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.490> on

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that the captain's originally going on

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
that the captain's originally going on
playing<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.870> thought<00:02:45.900> well<00:02:46.260> if

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
playing but then I thought well if

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
playing but then I thought well if
they're<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.220> arena<00:02:47.610> full<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.970> people<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.330> don't

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
they're in arena full of people I don't

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.370 
they're in arena full of people I don't
wanna<00:02:48.630> sit<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.900> watch<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.110> want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> get

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
wanna sit and watch I want to get

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.260 
wanna sit and watch I want to get
involved<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.310> probably<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
involved but I probably got one of the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.610 
involved but I probably got one of the
best<00:02:51.300> batters<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> world<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.260> my<00:02:52.350> said

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
best batters in the world in my said

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.190 
best batters in the world in my said
Marcus<00:02:52.980> Trescothick<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.989> even<00:02:54.989> though<00:02:55.140> he

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
Marcus Trescothick so even though he

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.570 
Marcus Trescothick so even though he
doesn't<00:02:55.350> play<00:02:55.530> international<00:02:56.040> cricket<00:02:56.430> night

doesn't play international cricket night

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.920 
doesn't play international cricket night
he's<00:02:56.970> probably<00:02:57.090> playing<00:02:57.360> better<00:02:57.660> than<00:02:57.720> he

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
he's probably playing better than he

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.740 
he's probably playing better than he
ever<00:02:58.020> did<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.350> England<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.030> I<00:03:00.030> can't<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:00.540> me
