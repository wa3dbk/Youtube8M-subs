00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 good morning 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.040
 the day 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.330
 well found well found here too 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.180
 becomes a spectator, therefore respect, yes, yes 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.730
 because I'm fascinated by pizza this is it 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.790
 really the sign the ticket from 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.510
 visit however I wonder the presence 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.379
 very welcome of fulvio of marine to which 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.390
 Motivation ranks why today do not 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.640
 works the grain but we work with the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.320
 spelled even healthier race if me 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.330
 that is, it allows no because the symbol is that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.820
 then you create project in doing is 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.430
 definitely an even more form 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.440
 say yes, yes, yes, but yes 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.690
 I would like to dispel the myth of the lighthouse as 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.360
 special flour as different flour as 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 the lighthouse is special because good before 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.289
 all because maybe even better than 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.910
 many other cereals but above all the 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.340
 spelled and the perfect flour for the home 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.920
 that is today gabriele makes a mixture with the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.110
 pizza but with the lighthouse at home we can do i 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.940
 desserts we can do a lot of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.800
 innovations simply by replacing the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.200
 regular flour recipe for the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.700
 flour to make a very tasty product 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.380
 but above all also available as 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.509
 you said all that from 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.569
 voice curtains are not able to do 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.429
 compare on a scientific level but I know that 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.679
 doing it is more digestible treatments 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.649
 this too I must say is approaching 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.780
 more also to children then also 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.690
 very convenient because when I explain one 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.910
 recipe with wheat I always pass the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.899
 leavening 24 hours in the refrigerator 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.119
 certainly the spelled after 5 6 hours is already ready 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.200
 therefore even more immediately in the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.289
 made of engines clear but I have to 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 rise for strength 24 I say no 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.780
 replace wheat with perfect spelled 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.569
 this is what spelled is here 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 will make white equal angry here it is 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.600
 here too 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's very important because what to do 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.570
 we must choose to do it by sifting 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.000
 he feels certain he has been reborn 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.800
 boring to produce is absolutely the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.300
 I will go as we said a flour that 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.710
 can be as full as the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.660
 we only know it as integral instead 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.490
 doing so you can sift then buratta 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.440
 re that seasoning process e 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.700
 make it white throw means that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.050
 still remains within the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.670
 therefore trace elements of the parts 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.260
 important that they are the germ of the grain 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.000
 water-soluble vitamins one 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.770
 but a very light part of fiber there 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 allows you to do work 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.020
 exactly like with white flour 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.130
 classic and asks an ignorant question 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.320
 perhaps in case of ignorant damage but yes 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.739
 it also finds spelled flour already made 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.620
 certainly absolutely yes but in all it is the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.660
 rennes shops a little specialized on 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.550
 different flour the lighthouse a flour e 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.180
 above all I would also like to say something 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.620
 important is that when we buy lighthouse 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.940
 almost all of us cover Italian making 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 because in Italy we are great 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.380
 quality manufacturers to do so also 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.900
 unintentionally we help Italy that is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.260
 those that the Italian port today as 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.570
 today then you still put the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.060
 yeast sellerie proceeding is it 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.910
 same as the wheat then called flour of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.709
 spelled both in kg a pinch of poison of the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.820
 grammy and a half of beer inhabitants 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.130
 dry 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.140
 I add 60 60 per cent of water 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 so we are about 700 grams per liter 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.700
 per kilo then I do a mass ok but 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.360
 at this point we added the salt 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.620
 always away from the yeast and put it to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.640
 rise for 5 6 hours 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.280
 ok good time saving and then the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.120
 taste is wonderful at this point 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.530
 we have these results taken from the oil 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:49.470
 of course , extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.489
 at this point I put it too 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.620
 then listen you said that the 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.260
 iron family can be done alone but 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.840
 even if I make the tart mum 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.489
 because a weak flour then one 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.769
 weak family works on the fragrance 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.019
 I think the pastry should be 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.220
 made with weak grade flour then 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:14.739
 the famous hard biscuit flour or 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:17.280
 with doing so then this point or before 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.169
 the rune stuffed then ancient grain 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.750
 ancient cereal ancient pizza 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.880
 the focaccia with the endive is fine 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.490
 endive in pan with a little anchovy 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.539
 and garlic we do dry add 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:36.520
 the raisins the olives of the caper ok room 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:42.790
 tasty on the half on the baking sheet this 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:47.380
 manner with my filling that 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:51.130
 the center of the games 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.380
 the profit is beautiful is beautiful 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.840
 you feel the scarola just the absence 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.900
 maharaja themselves but then between him and the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.180
 capers, that is, dinner is served there 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.120
 we close in a disorderly manner 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.840
 to give a rustic look, certainly not 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.260
 you know a cake for the information to 220 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.060
 degrees 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.490
 as much as we let her stay for a while 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.080
 plus 220 degrees after twenty minutes already 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.290
 ready 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.030
 mass the oven today always takes place in 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.730
 Low and then settle lit 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.680
 here is our flat bread moves 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.720
 and this is really in the image of 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.140
 rustic that this is the title of 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.240
 small to this point that happens 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.730
 I want the part where there is bread 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.160
 feel good so I'm going to die a 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.560
 bit of extra virgin olive oil this is it 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.510
 beautiful minimally softens 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.590
 without losing the carcass and soon 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.660
 less 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.600
 the olive oil of having a crush e 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.930
 angels sing in angeles channels 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.689
 dedicated to all for this that the 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.139
 our pizza 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:05.409
 undoubtedly a dish with the endive 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.960
 typical cellino then thanks me to 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.259
 our my husband 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.009
 Lazio where the teacher lives right 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.009
 understand many
