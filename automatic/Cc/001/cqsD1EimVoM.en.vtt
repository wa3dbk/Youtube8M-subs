have a little history together so the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
have a little history together so the
good<00:01:31.530> news<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.159> converted<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
good news was when they converted it

over you know the car hasn't ran a/c in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
over you know the car hasn't ran a/c in
years<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:37.110> afraid<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.979> might<00:01:38.130> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
years I was afraid that there might have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580 
years I was afraid that there might have
been<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.400> leak<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.700> something<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.439> hit<00:01:40.439> all

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
been a leak or something but hit all

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
been a leak or something but hit all
went<00:01:40.799> smooth<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.400> basically<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.240> did

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
went smooth they basically all they did

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.370 
went smooth they basically all they did
was<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.770> retrofitted<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> charge<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> up

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
was just retrofitted and charge it up

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
was just retrofitted and charge it up
with<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> Astroland<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.659> 130<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
with the Astroland the 130 for a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.310 
with the Astroland the 130 for a
refrigerant<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.250> no<00:01:50.810> no<00:01:51.810> problems

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
refrigerant so there was no no problems

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.010 
refrigerant so there was no no problems
just<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.460> quick<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:56.600> blows<00:01:57.600> cold<00:01:57.899> air

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
just just a quick thing blows cold air

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.910 
just just a quick thing blows cold air
now

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920

I'm<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.410> was<00:02:08.560> worried<00:02:08.890> about<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.759> hood

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
I'm I was worried about the hood

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.360 
I'm I was worried about the hood
clearance<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:13.150> chance<00:02:14.130> when<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.220> hood

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
clearance this chance when the hood

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.820 
clearance this chance when the hood
shuts<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.870> they<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.290> said<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> lot<00:02:17.650> higher

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
shuts and they just said a lot higher

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.949 
shuts and they just said a lot higher
than<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> stock<00:02:18.400> ones<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:18.910> if<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.810> look

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
than the stock ones but if you look

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.350 
than the stock ones but if you look
closely<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.560> does<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.640> does<00:02:21.880> look<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.090> it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
closely it does it does look like it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440 
closely it does it does look like it
clear<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.340> there's<00:02:24.340> no<00:02:24.459> major<00:02:24.700> marks<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
clear so there's no major marks on the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.970 
clear so there's no major marks on the
actual<00:02:26.550> top<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:31.680> yep
