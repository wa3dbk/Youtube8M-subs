this<00:01:12.549> guitar<00:01:14.700> basically<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.000> does<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.420> it

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
this guitar basically what it does is it

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.460 
this guitar basically what it does is it
just<00:01:16.570> dials<00:01:17.320> in<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.860> whole<00:01:18.310> lot<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.549> sustain<00:01:19.470> for

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
just dials in a whole lot of sustain for

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.800 
just dials in a whole lot of sustain for
soloing<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.039> stuff<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:22.570> guitar

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
soloing and stuff like that this guitar

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.289 
soloing and stuff like that this guitar
has<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.380> noiseless<00:01:23.740> pickups<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.399> it<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:24.970> it's

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
has the noiseless pickups in it so it's

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.539 
has the noiseless pickups in it so it's
it<00:01:25.750> doesn't<00:01:26.229> quite<00:01:26.740> sound<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.310> the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
it doesn't quite sound like the

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.249 
it doesn't quite sound like the
traditional<00:01:28.060> strata<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.600> has<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.750> little<00:01:29.140> bit

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
traditional strata it has a little bit

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.630 
traditional strata it has a little bit
of<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.440> different<00:01:29.830> kind<00:01:30.069> of<00:01:30.250> maybe<00:01:30.429> a<00:01:30.550> little

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
of a different kind of maybe a little

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.700 
of a different kind of maybe a little
bit<00:01:30.909> more<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.179> modern<00:01:31.330> sound<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.110> then

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
bit more of a modern sound to it then

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.809 
bit more of a modern sound to it then
you'd<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:32.979> from<00:01:33.250> just<00:01:33.460> like<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.610> regular

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
very clean it's a 2012 model other than

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.850 
very clean it's a 2012 model other than
that<00:03:45.610> everything<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.780> spot-on

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
that everything on it is is spot-on

that everything on it is is spot-on
there's<00:03:48.370> no<00:03:48.520> fret<00:03:48.820> where<00:03:49.500> no<00:03:50.500> issues<00:03:50.890> with<00:03:51.070> it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
there's no fret where no issues with it

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.520 
there's no fret where no issues with it
another<00:03:51.910> note<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.690> clapping<00:03:53.110> strat<00:03:53.320> has<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
another note the clapping strat has a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.330 
another note the clapping strat has a
blocked<00:03:53.890> bridge<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:55.300> can<00:03:55.630> be<00:03:55.780> unblocked<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
blocked bridge it can be unblocked so

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.930 
blocked bridge it can be unblocked so
that<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.970> works<00:03:58.300> as<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.410> trim<00:03:59.800> but<00:04:00.489> they

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
that it it works as a trim but they

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.410 
that it it works as a trim but they
actually<00:04:01.239> that's<00:04:02.200> an<00:04:02.380> air<00:04:02.560> expects<00:04:03.269> make<00:04:04.269> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
actually that's an air expects make the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.080 
actually that's an air expects make the
bridge<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.080> doesn't<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:06.459> actually

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
bridge so that it doesn't it actually

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.210 
bridge so that it doesn't it actually
acts<00:04:07.420> as<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.690> hardtail<00:04:08.110> but<00:04:08.860> again<00:04:09.070> it's

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
acts as a hardtail but again it's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.620 
acts as a hardtail but again it's
something<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.550> can<00:04:09.760> be<00:04:09.790> undone<00:04:10.180> if<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:10.450> want

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
something that can be undone if you want

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.120 
something that can be undone if you want
to<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.900> what<00:04:11.050> it's<00:04:11.170> just<00:04:11.380> it's<00:04:11.590> just<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.890> block

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
to do what it's just it's just a block

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.850 
to do what it's just it's just a block
on<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.430> on<00:04:12.910> each<00:04:13.030> side<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.620> bridge

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
on the on each side of the the bridge

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.940 
on the on each side of the the bridge
that<00:04:15.459> just<00:04:15.670> keeps<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:15.970> from<00:04:16.120> moving<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.769> other

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
that just keeps it from moving so other

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.000 
that just keeps it from moving so other
than<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.750> really<00:04:19.750> not<00:04:19.989> much<00:04:20.109> else<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> say<00:04:20.709> if

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
than that really not much else to say if

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.890 
than that really not much else to say if
you're<00:04:21.130> looking<00:04:21.370> for<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.549> really<00:04:21.880> really<00:04:22.570> clean
