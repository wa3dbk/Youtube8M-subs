press hotfoot about here I like to play
it<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:59.130> it's<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it here because it's really not that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.850 
it here because it's really not that
important<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.050> doing<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> little

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
flick at the end the back foot is most

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.120 
flick at the end the back foot is most
important<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:07.469> you<00:01:07.590> should<00:01:07.889> when<00:01:08.039> you

pop it you're going to flick it right
about<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.929> boards<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.579> about

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
about here like when the boards at about

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.669 
about here like when the boards at about
a<00:01:14.609> 45<00:01:15.149> degree<00:01:15.179> angle<00:01:15.479> three<00:01:16.079> angle<00:01:16.380> i'm<00:01:16.439> going

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
a 45 degree angle three angle i'm going

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.649 
a 45 degree angle three angle i'm going
to<00:01:16.740> flick<00:01:16.889> it<00:01:17.069> and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to flick it and then you're going to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.870 
to flick it and then you're going to
watch<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.929> board<00:01:19.139> come<00:01:19.289> around<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> catch<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
watch the board come around and catch it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.429 
watch the board come around and catch it
with<00:01:21.149> your<00:01:21.179> feet<00:01:21.509> you'll<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.170> able<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> watch

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
with your feet you'll be able to watch

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
with your feet you'll be able to watch
the<00:01:22.740> board<00:01:22.950> come<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.429> now<00:01:23.700> you're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the board come around because now you're

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.770 
the board come around because now you're
used<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.149> doing<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.659> kick<00:01:24.840> flips<00:01:25.159> so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
used to doing it with the kick flips so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.209 
used to doing it with the kick flips so
that's<00:01:27.780> basically<00:01:30.259> having<00:01:31.259> problems<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.039> it

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
that's basically having problems with it

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.209 
that's basically having problems with it
I<00:01:32.450> would<00:01:33.450> say<00:01:33.810> definitely<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.380> under<00:01:34.679> rotating

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
I would say definitely is under rotating

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.550 
I would say definitely is under rotating
it<00:01:35.420> when<00:01:36.420> i<00:01:36.450> first<00:01:36.779> started<00:01:36.990> laying<00:01:37.139> the<00:01:37.289> trick

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it when i first started laying the trick

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.099 
it when i first started laying the trick
out<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.670> under<00:01:39.389> okay<00:01:39.990> okay<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.189> wife<00:01:41.399> is<00:01:42.109> like

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
out or under okay okay my wife is like

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.669 
out or under okay okay my wife is like
this<00:01:43.409> yeah<00:01:44.869> when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.200> start<00:01:46.469> getting

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
this yeah when you first start getting

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:47.839 
this yeah when you first start getting
the<00:01:46.740> rotation<00:01:47.249> you're<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> land<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
the rotation you're going to land it

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.850 
the rotation you're going to land it
with<00:01:47.969> one<00:01:48.149> foot

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
with one foot

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
with one foot
probably<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.550> front<00:01:50.760> foot<00:01:50.940> because<00:01:51.240> you're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
probably the front foot because you're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
probably the front foot because you're
still<00:01:51.870> not<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.260> little<00:01:52.620> shaky<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.040> putting

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
still not a little shaky about putting

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.090 
still not a little shaky about putting
that<00:01:53.490> back<00:01:53.670> foot<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.650> when<00:01:55.650> I<00:01:55.740> first<00:01:55.980> started

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that back foot on when I first started

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.060 
that back foot on when I first started
doing<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
doing it

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.100 
doing it
something<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.540> but<00:01:59.870> really

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
something out like that but really

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.300 
something out like that but really
that's<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.440> that's<00:02:00.800> not<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.100> big<00:02:01.250> problem

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
that's not a that's not a big problem

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.040 
that's not a that's not a big problem
with<00:02:01.670> district<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.180> never<00:02:02.390> really<00:02:02.600> slipped<00:02:02.900> out

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
with district I never really slipped out

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.840 
with district I never really slipped out
of<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.350> when<00:02:03.470> i<00:02:03.560> first<00:02:04.430> started<00:02:04.700> i<00:02:04.820> met<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:06.850> lot

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
of it when i first started i met a lot

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.910 
of it when i first started i met a lot
of<00:02:07.910> people<00:02:08.030> say<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.690> cream<00:02:09.050> also<00:02:09.229> big<00:02:09.500> thing

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
of people say that cream also big thing

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.400 
of people say that cream also big thing
in<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.160> trick<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.610> that's<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:11.410> common

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
in this trick like that's a common

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.560 
in this trick like that's a common
problem<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:12.980> i<00:02:13.520> don't<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.180> too<00:02:14.390> many

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
problem but i don't really have too many

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.690 
problem but i don't really have too many
problems<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> only<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.550> if

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
problems with that are the only time if

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.510 
problems with that are the only time if
I<00:02:16.790> land<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.090> primo<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.320> probably<00:02:19.130> land<00:02:19.310> like
