00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.859
 in this project 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 what you try to do is a 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.529
 energy recovery 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 to be able to perform regenerative brakes 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 in a next stage 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.360
 the most important thing of this since it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.670
 they have certain indispensable sections 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 a lot of time is wasted on a bicycle 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.040
 energy in the part of the ballatas 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.039
 by the heat 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 the heat that is wasted by means of 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 fiction when a person brakes 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 here we can observe the part of the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.210
 registered 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.850
 if we see when we brake 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.549
 we are activating 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.659
 the sensor modifying the position of 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.659
 this potentiometer 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.650
 this potentiometer gives us a signal 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.040
 analog that goes directly for this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.040
 cable 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.369
 so the card 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.729
 the parts in which the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.729
 microcontroller 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.250
 of this analog signal 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.270
 thanks to a control circuit 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.479
 it's a width modulation circuit 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.329
 of the pulse we can control how much 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.220
 these will be connected 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.480
 solenoids 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.440
 these are the goods are 6 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.260
 connected 3 in series 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.820
 with three others in series arranged in 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.140
 parallel form 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.140
 have twice the current 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.760
 on this side you can see the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.760
 elements of the two magnets 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.760
 which are neodymium magnets 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.360
 those neodymium magnets when going through the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 coils generate a flow 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.319
 the magnetic flux and following the rule 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.069
 of the right hand is 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.069
 the force 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.640
 and we can observe 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 native who is producing me a group 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.080
 of flow we can take advantage of 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.080
 we can use it in the air '
