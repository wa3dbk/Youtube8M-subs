and to pop the bat down same again
finger<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> loop<00:01:05.479> just<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
finger in the loop just down like so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
finger in the loop just down like so
really<00:01:07.979> simple<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:10.760> top<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> range

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
really simple to do top of the range

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
really simple to do top of the range
this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> techni<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.320> comes<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this is the techni so comes with a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
this is the techni so comes with a
leather<00:01:14.670> seats<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:16.740> absolutely<00:01:17.220> mint<00:01:18.950> let's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
leather seats to absolutely mint let's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.090 
leather seats to absolutely mint let's
move<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> front<00:01:20.729> again<00:01:22.100> front

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
move around to the front again front

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
move around to the front again front
seats<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.549> leather<00:01:23.670> seats<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> they're

seats are leather seats and they're
heated<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.409> well<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.280> come<00:01:26.460> wintertime<00:01:26.790> you've

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
heated as well so come wintertime you've

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899 
heated as well so come wintertime you've
got<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.570> bonus<00:01:28.250> height<00:01:29.250> adjustable

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
got that little bonus height adjustable

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
got that little bonus height adjustable
so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> lever<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.259> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so you can just use this lever here for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.910 
so you can just use this lever here for
the<00:01:31.920> driver's<00:01:32.369> seat<00:01:32.869> change<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.140> seating

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.840 

it's<00:01:40.119> got<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.299> satellite<00:01:40.869> navigation<00:01:41.259> system

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.740 

here<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.030> go

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
here we go

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.840 
here we go
which<00:01:51.290> also<00:01:51.470> doubles<00:01:51.860> up<00:01:52.100> as<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.310> reversing

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
which also doubles up as a reversing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.550 
which also doubles up as a reversing
camera so<00:01:53.750> as<00:01:53.840> soon<00:01:53.990> as<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.170> put<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.380> car

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
camera so as soon as you put the car

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.820 
camera so as soon as you put the car
into<00:01:55.040> reverse<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:56.350> camera<00:01:57.350> there<00:01:57.530> as<00:01:57.650> well

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
into reverse you camera there as well

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.969 
into reverse you camera there as well
helps<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.280> reverse<00:01:59.380> dual<00:02:00.380> zone<00:02:00.680> climate

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
helps you reverse dual zone climate

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.820 
helps you reverse dual zone climate
controlled<00:02:01.940> air<00:02:02.090> come<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.260> driver<00:02:03.560> and
