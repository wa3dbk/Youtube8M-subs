 and they are waiting for this 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.829
 the report issued weekly in my privacy in front of the arch 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.890

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.630
 and this 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.890
 And if that is what is considered small 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 nothing weird 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.760

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 one keyboard look for the other one is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.120
 Think big 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.620
 and well we have to explain 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.080
 efe if you have to 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 if he is going to play and everything 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.780
 with zeta 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 She explained that she is bending over 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.650
 with xc I made jump with se elche returns 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.150
 and with the growing fears 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.870
 the Catalan 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.250
 but the moment 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 others and Carmen is that since she is a bit slow 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.580
 and it's good that the truth is 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.150
 this game is that of feeling 4 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.360
 the truth I think we came out of wanting to month 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.990
 the iss 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 the unreality 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.830
 Of course you want to achieve it but the truth is I do not 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.310
 I've been able to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.399
 but hey, I'll leave that to you, this descent is what they want 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 then they continue to only two kilometers and have them charge 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:11.669
 It was in the vicinity
