00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.500
You know, when you need extra space, taking
advantage of the underutilized space you have

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.970
in an attic might be a way to maybe add another
room.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480
That's what I did here with this guest room.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.740
It's actually up in the attic.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.960
And you come up these stairs.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.200
And I wanted to make it feel like a farmhouse.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.550
So all the materials here, and the layout
of the room itself, are those that you might

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.380
of found in a farmhouse in about 1900.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.530
When you come up here, you can tell that this
is an attic space.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.600
Some of the tell-tale signs include, well,
just the shape of the roof of the ceiling.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.170
You see, it actually follows the roof.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.360
So what we did is we moved in from the edges
of the roof to make this wall, and the same

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.870
on this side.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.830
And then from the 7 foot mark up to here is
9 feet, and then we flattened it off.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.260
So at the highest point it's 9 feet, 7 feet
on the sides.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.090
And what I used for material up here is old
fashioned beadboard, but it's really not beadboard.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.320
It's actually 4x8 sheets of pressed beadboard,
just to give the look.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.200
I wanted to save a little money.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.020
So take a look at the floors.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.030
You see, these are tongue and groove pine
floors.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.240
We didn't use first-grade pine.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.659
Meaning, the very best grade of pine.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.259
This is a second-grade pine.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.909
It was less expensive.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.310
But what I decided to do up here was paint
it.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.039
I didn't wanna stain it or do some sorta hardwood
finish, I wanted it just to be painted.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.319
Because it feels like this room.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.530
I wanted it to be really comfortable and easy
and relaxed and that the colors be really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.530
cool.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.170
That's why I chose this soft green, and on
the walls, a really soft blue.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.530
So let's take a look at the layout of the
furniture.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859
You see, again, comfort is key here.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.539
I wanted to make sure that not only was there
a comfortable bed, but also a baby crib, in

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.820
case guests might bring an infant.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.840
Also, I wanted a place for them to just kick
back and relax.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.780
It's up in the attic, they're away from all
the hubbub of the house, so there are a couple

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.509
of swivel chairs for rocking the baby or just
relaxing, and a really nice sofa that's slipcovered

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.870
with some bright colors that really pop.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.810
There's a enough space in this 15x17 room
to accommodate this full-sized bed.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.640
And if you have enough room in the attic,
you might think about adding a bathroom.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.819
And there was just enough in this nook up
here for me to put a bathroom in.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.300
Only enough room to put in a shower, just
in line with the valley of the roof.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
But hey, it worked.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.260
I have to say, this is a room I had a lot
of fun in designing.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.760
Just take a look at the lights: They're star
shaped.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.420
They look really old-fashioned, but they're
made by Circle Lighting and readily available.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.790
And then the floor itself, well, I've got
a woven cotton rug made by Albert and Dash,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.310
which I love the colors -- pink and white.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.540
This is the same pattern that you find in
the stair hall coming up into this space.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710
And as for the art, I went with drawings that
children had made and framed them and put

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.269
them all along the walls.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.159
To lighten the room up, I chose to use all
painted furniture, which I think really works.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.480
For instance, this one over in the corner
was a chest of drawers that was made in the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.560
1830s.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.180
The veneer was so bad, and the price of it
was so right -- because I bought that for

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.250
50 bucks, and had it painted.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.469
And I think the color looks great in here.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.260

Alright, well we'll see you tomorrow.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.290
Thank goodness I have plenty of room.
