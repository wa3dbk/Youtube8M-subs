in<00:04:34.590> there<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.979> then<00:04:35.160> letting<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.389> is

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
in there and then letting it go this is

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.000 
in there and then letting it go this is
the<00:04:36.630> process<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.200> do<00:04:37.380> for<00:04:37.470> my<00:04:37.560> whole<00:04:37.800> head

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010
