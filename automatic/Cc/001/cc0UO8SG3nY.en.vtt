are ever but the problem I'm having with
my<00:00:44.969> aces<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> notice<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
my aces is that if you notice you see on

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
my aces is that if you notice you see on
the<00:00:48.840> left<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.430> both<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> them

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the left now this is what both of them

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170 
the left now this is what both of them
on<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.570> left<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.739> axle<00:00:53.219> looks<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
on the left the axle looks like it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
on the left the axle looks like it
sticks<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.510> further<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.079> hangar<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sticks out further from the hangar and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
sticks out further from the hangar and
on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.100> looks<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.610> shorter

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
on the right looks like it's shorter

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
on the right looks like it's shorter
well<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.840> always<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
well it's not always like that when I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.029 
well it's not always like that when I
first<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.460> were<00:00:59.520> completely<00:00:59.879> even

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
first got them they were completely even

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.149 
first got them they were completely even
so<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.399> means<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.660> axle<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.589> fitting<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
so that means that the axle is fitting a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
so that means that the axle is fitting a
little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.549> loose<00:01:05.850> inside<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> hangar<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
little bit loose inside of the hangar so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.940 
little bit loose inside of the hangar so
I<00:01:07.560> made<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> full<00:01:08.010> video<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.500> going

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I made a full video on it and I'm going

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
I made a full video on it and I'm going
to<00:01:10.979> email<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> ace<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.049> see<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to email it to ace and see if they can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
to email it to ace and see if they can
spot<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.040> another<00:01:14.280> set<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> 33s<00:01:17.450> because

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
spot me with another set of 33s because

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
spot me with another set of 33s because
that<00:01:18.689> should<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.320> happen<00:01:19.759> that's<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> first

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that should not happen that's the first

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.460 
that should not happen that's the first
time<00:01:21.180> I've<00:01:21.360> ever<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> issue<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
time I've ever had that issue that's the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
time I've ever had that issue that's the
first<00:01:22.680> time<00:01:22.710> I've<00:01:22.860> ever<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.460> heard<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
first time I've ever even heard of that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560 
first time I've ever even heard of that
issue<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> noticed<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
issue but I noticed it when all of a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.740 
issue but I noticed it when all of a
sudden<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> king<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> axle<00:01:32.549> nut

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
sudden the king the the axle nut

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.850 
sudden the king the the axle nut
stinging<00:01:33.750> came<00:01:33.960> home<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> second<00:01:34.710> but

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
stinging came home for a second but

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.969 
stinging came home for a second but
anyhow<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.579> axle<00:01:36.030> nut<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.560> would<00:01:37.560> always<00:01:37.680> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
anyhow the axle nut I would always I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
anyhow the axle nut I would always I
thought<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.729> tightening<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.360> because

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
thought they was tightening up because

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.630 
thought they was tightening up because
my<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.159> real<00:01:41.400> tight<00:01:41.610> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
my will would just be on real tight with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.770 
my will would just be on real tight with
no<00:01:42.000> play<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:42.899> barely<00:01:43.110> roll

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
no play at all and it would barely roll

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
no play at all and it would barely roll
but<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.380> turns<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.310> i<00:01:48.740> noticed<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.829> ok

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
but it turns out that i noticed that ok

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.690 
but it turns out that i noticed that ok
it<00:01:50.850> keeps<00:01:51.149> getting<00:01:51.329> shorter<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.960> shorter<00:01:52.700> ok

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it keeps getting shorter and shorter ok

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
it keeps getting shorter and shorter ok
this<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> huge<00:01:54.570> issue<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:55.979> found<00:01:56.159> out

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this can be a huge issue so i found out

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.330 
this can be a huge issue so i found out
what<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> issue<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.210> by<00:01:57.329> looking<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
what the issue was just by looking at it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.319 
what the issue was just by looking at it
but<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> bums<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> most

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
they took pretty well on this 8.25 i

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.140 
they took pretty well on this 8.25 i
always<00:02:49.379> thought<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.129> independent<00:02:50.609> 149

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150

s<00:02:51.389> and<00:02:51.540> ace<00:02:51.870> 44s<00:02:52.799> were<00:02:53.389> 8.5<00:02:54.389> but<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.319> really

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
s and ace 44s were 8.5 but I'm really

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.159 
s and ace 44s were 8.5 but I'm really
starting<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.919> question<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.519> now<00:02:56.930> they<00:02:57.930> seem

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
starting to question it now they seem

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.270 
starting to question it now they seem
like<00:02:58.290> they're<00:02:58.439> a<00:02:58.500> little<00:02:58.650> bit<00:02:58.799> bigger<00:02:59.069> than

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
like they're a little bit bigger than

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.610 
like they're a little bit bigger than
8.25<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:00.480> maybe<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.720> little<00:03:00.870> smaller<00:03:01.019> than<00:03:01.260> 85

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
8.25 but maybe a little smaller than 85

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.170 
8.25 but maybe a little smaller than 85
I<00:03:01.950> wonder<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.310> their<00:03:02.430> measurements<00:03:02.909> are<00:03:03.000> just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I wonder if their measurements are just

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.059 
I wonder if their measurements are just
a<00:03:03.239> little<00:03:03.450> bit<00:03:03.540> off<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.810> they're<00:03:03.900> actually

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
a little bit off and they're actually

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.360 
a little bit off and they're actually
8.38<00:03:05.069> right<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.669> middle<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.189> new

there parking street formula I've been

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.629 
there parking street formula I've been
scanning<00:03:31.829> these<00:03:32.099> for<00:03:33.229> five<00:03:34.229> months<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.889> little

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
scanning these for five months a little

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.830 
scanning these for five months a little
over<00:03:35.879> five<00:03:36.090> months<00:03:36.500> no<00:03:37.500> flat<00:03:37.829> spots<00:03:38.190> at<00:03:38.370> all

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
over five months no flat spots at all

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.240 
over five months no flat spots at all
and<00:03:39.840> their<00:03:39.959> last<00:03:40.229> seemed<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.919> good

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and their last seemed really good

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.219 
and their last seemed really good
they've<00:03:41.849> hardly<00:03:42.269> even<00:03:42.419> worn<00:03:42.750> down<00:03:42.959> they<00:03:43.169> were

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
they've hardly even worn down they were

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.949 
they've hardly even worn down they were
54<00:03:43.979> when<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.250> first<00:03:44.459> put<00:03:44.699> them<00:03:44.819> on<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.930> think

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
54 when I first put them on and I think

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.839 
54 when I first put them on and I think
there's<00:03:46.590> still<00:03:46.829> about<00:03:46.979> fifty<00:03:47.579> four

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
there's still about fifty four

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.119 
there's still about fifty four
millimeters<00:03:48.449> that<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:48.870> insane<00:03:49.379> of<00:03:49.590> how<00:03:49.709> long

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
millimeters that it's insane of how long

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.699 
millimeters that it's insane of how long
they<00:03:50.459> are<00:03:50.519> lasting<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:52.260> they<00:03:52.379> were<00:03:52.440> not

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
they are lasting but they were not

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.050 
they are lasting but they were not
always<00:03:52.919> shaped<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:53.819> actually

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
always shaped like this I actually

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.849 
always shaped like this I actually
reshape<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.959> today<00:03:55.109> using<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.590> grinder<00:03:55.829> I'm

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
reshape them today using a grinder I'm

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.369 
reshape them today using a grinder I'm
decided<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:58.949> side<00:03:59.280> cut<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:01.019> think<00:04:01.290> it's

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
decided to a side cut and I think it's

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.460 
decided to a side cut and I think it's
one<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.620> best<00:04:02.189> ideas<00:04:03.030> I've<00:04:03.389> more<00:04:04.199> best

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
one of the best ideas I've more best

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.349 
one of the best ideas I've more best
things<00:04:04.680> I've<00:04:04.829> done<00:04:04.859> with<00:04:05.069> my<00:04:05.129> wills<00:04:05.430> ever

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
things I've done with my wills ever

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.800 
things I've done with my wills ever
because<00:04:06.989> once<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.739> did<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.939> was<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.449> so

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
because once I did that it was just so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.800 
because once I did that it was just so
much<00:04:10.019> easier<00:04:10.259> to<00:04:10.859> lock<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:15.509> can<00:04:15.599> see

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
much easier to lock in so you can see

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.899 
much easier to lock in so you can see
that<00:04:15.840> they're<00:04:17.000> nice<00:04:18.000> side<00:04:18.359> cut<00:04:18.690> locks<00:04:19.530> and

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
that they're nice side cut locks and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.320 
that they're nice side cut locks and
super<00:04:20.909> nice<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.800> I<00:04:22.800> got<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> decent<00:04:23.700> groove<00:04:24.120> on

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
super nice and I got a decent groove on

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.950 
super nice and I got a decent groove on
these<00:04:24.479> independence<00:04:25.880> why<00:04:26.880> stop<00:04:27.210> skating

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
these independence why stop skating

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.510 
these independence why stop skating
was<00:04:28.139> because<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:29.009> down<00:04:29.039> in<00:04:29.370> size

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
was because I was going down in size

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.840 
was because I was going down in size
back<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.060> like<00:04:30.210> eight<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:34.490> scan<00:04:35.490> them<00:04:35.639> again

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
back to like eight but scan them again

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.339 
back to like eight but scan them again
and<00:04:36.630> I'm<00:04:36.960> escape<00:04:37.319> these<00:04:37.500> until<00:04:39.349> basically

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
and I'm escape these until basically

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.760 
and I'm escape these until basically
snap<00:04:40.949> them<00:04:42.259> more<00:04:43.259> until<00:04:43.470> they're<00:04:43.590> like

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
snap them more until they're like

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.050 
snap them more until they're like
getting<00:04:43.949> really<00:04:44.160> close<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.550> snapping<00:04:44.759> to

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
getting really close to snapping to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.159 
getting really close to snapping to
where<00:04:45.210> I'm<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.419> starting<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.750> grind<00:04:46.020> down

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
where I'm like starting to grind down

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.089 
where I'm like starting to grind down
into<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> axle<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:49.620> really<00:04:49.770> I'm<00:04:50.069> just

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
into the axle but it's really I'm just

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.770 
into the axle but it's really I'm just
hoping<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.520> ace<00:04:50.789> can<00:04:51.090> hook<00:04:51.300> me<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:51.479> with<00:04:51.750> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
hoping that ace can hook me up with a

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.960 
hoping that ace can hook me up with a
another<00:04:52.410> set<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.770> 33<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:53.400> because<00:04:53.729> I'm<00:04:53.819> having

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
another set of 33 is because I'm having

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.080 
another set of 33 is because I'm having
that<00:04:54.180> really<00:04:54.569> odd<00:04:55.319> axle<00:04:56.130> issue<00:04:56.310> with<00:04:56.610> axles

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
that really odd axle issue with axles

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.270 
that really odd axle issue with axles
