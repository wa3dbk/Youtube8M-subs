exciting<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.500> when<00:03:23.739> you're<00:03:23.889> getting<00:03:23.949> shot

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
exciting is when you're getting shot

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.339 
exciting is when you're getting shot
when<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.419> run<00:03:25.599> away<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.900> want<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.169> look<00:03:26.260> at

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
when you run away you want to look at

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.460 
when you run away you want to look at
the<00:03:26.440> ground<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.980> your<00:03:27.190> head<00:03:27.940> isn't<00:03:28.120> showing<00:03:28.510> so

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the ground so your head isn't showing so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.860 
the ground so your head isn't showing so
it'd<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.739> harder<00:03:30.010> for<00:03:30.040> them<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> kill<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:31.030> with

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
it'd be harder for them to kill you with

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.309 
it'd be harder for them to kill you with
the<00:03:31.989> headshot<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:33.720> your<00:03:34.720> hip<00:03:34.840> box<00:03:35.049> will<00:03:35.230> be

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the headshot and your hip box will be

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.659 
the headshot and your hip box will be
smaller<00:03:35.560> which<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.310> also<00:03:36.489> good<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:39.370> team

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
smaller which is also good the team

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.319 
smaller which is also good the team
slayer<00:03:40.379> DMR's<00:03:41.379> is<00:03:41.650> fun<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.060> like<00:03:43.239> the

DMR<00:03:43.659> a<00:03:43.690> little<00:03:44.019> bit<00:03:44.139> better<00:03:44.229> than<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> battle

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
DMR a little bit better than the battle

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.379 
DMR a little bit better than the battle
rifle<00:03:45.579> because<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:45.909> have<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.090> be<00:03:46.180> more

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389
