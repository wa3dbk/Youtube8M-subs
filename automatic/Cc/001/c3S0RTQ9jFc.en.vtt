00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.110
 hello to all friends of tom sardo and we are 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.500
 still here in art 9 sunny yes but yes 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.320
 bit 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.630
 we found a nice producer 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.360
 of keyboards that only makes models 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.920
 mechanics is called das keyboard these 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.230
 are its three models of the line 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.180
 current we have the keyboard with 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.980
 switch cerri blue those more chi 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.930
 they tell them the most beautiful biscuits 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.760
 and that give more tactile feedback 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 high with in particular framed in 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.629
 precedence and the keyboard for mac 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.239
 this keyboard for real professionals 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.190
 with the softer switch the brown one 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.230
 and without any indication of the keys 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.420
 we have already seen models of this type 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 for example also from cooler master here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.890
 the real does not need either 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 having a restitere tativa from memory apparently 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 that this focuses much more on this 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.870
 instead of the red one the more one 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.490
 soft to a dumping system 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.240
 lower or amortization of the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.770
 key 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 but let's see the new product 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 that we really like it a lot 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.190
 this new aschi of board of which not 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 we still know the codename of 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 recent of other products to a body 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.740
 in aluminum and really has a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.049
 good-looking 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.420
 the chips c 6 c sons switch do appear 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.210
 be those blue drive beautiful 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.759
 croquettes also feel the impact of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.850
 keys this keyboard some functions 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.110
 multimedia we have a volume you can 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.479
 go back and forth in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.280
 multimedia reproduction the mute the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.939
 stand by button and whatever else we have 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.930
 also a switch excuse a usb 3.0 hub 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.210
 and then a very long and very long cable 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.000
 beautiful to see the Rossoneri colors 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 could perhaps offend fans of 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.420
 other sports teams 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.070
 but we are very curious to see it 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 at the exit the product is going to be 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.689
 launched at around 150 euros 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.970
 other products that I'm intrigued by 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.250
 real geeks and super geeks 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.369
 are these bags are really in fig 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.720
 and if you allow me technical term beyond 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.280
 to be nice to see these have 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.380
 really stacked 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.269
 incomprehensible to this is the bag 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.079
 closed very beautiful in this effect 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.390
 velvety 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.430
 after which when we open we all have 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.170
 pockets are possible and imaginable but 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 especially these pockets have one 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.160
 function that is called 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.260
 huck seed or anything 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 insert in certain pockets comes 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 completely isolated from a material 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.569
 special that practically prevents the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.410
 mobile phones to receive and issue 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.940
 radio transmissions of any kind and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.650
 even the furnishings to work at 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.120
 apparently this is a pocket that can 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.890
 quietly host a tablet a 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.660
 ipad or smartphone 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.970
 if you want total privacy mode 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.519
 here is the game is made fits e 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.470
 instead we close behind we have the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.510
 pocket for the notebook is very difficult 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.040
 with a microphone in his hand but since I have 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 many years of experience I can 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.280
 do 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.470
 no I can not do it but in two if there 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.510
 we will 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.060
 here is this pocket for the notebook 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.799
 always with the protection mentioned above 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.580
 another object very curious and very 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 interesting is this gaming bag 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.540
 it is really tasty for all 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.069
 lampard enthusiasts I saw it myself 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 I fell in love immediately even though a little 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.930
 bulky know in practice does not have the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.310
 digital security protection yes 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.109
 treats why you put the keyboard on it 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.790
 headphones and the mouse look cool 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.920
 this choice has thought of all of us 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.260
 nardoni was our travels to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.780
 lampard and therefore you are practically here 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.239
 all the accessories you put dvd cd 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.000
 memory card anything mouse headphones 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.290
 you close it and kept the lan parties like 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.359
 minimum this is the first thing you do 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.250
 it disappears because you just gamer it 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.260
 they see you definitely make it disappear 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.459
 but guys from das keyboard is everything 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.470
 ask me product on trial at most 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.250
 see you soon and see how we will find each other bye 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.250
 to all from roberto
