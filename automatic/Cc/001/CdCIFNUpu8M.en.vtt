hopefully like a jigsaw puzzle this
isn't<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> running<00:00:29.550> theme<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
isn't going to be a running theme and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
isn't going to be a running theme and
it's<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> portable<00:00:31.560> big-screen<00:00:32.009> gaming

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
cable power cable I don't oh I get it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
cable power cable I don't oh I get it
now<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.579> an<00:01:53.700> HDMI<00:01:54.149> extender<00:01:54.240> cable<00:01:55.020> and

now and then an HDMI extender cable and
a<00:01:55.380> quick<00:01:55.590> start<00:01:55.890> guide<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:56.969> that's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
a quick start guide so I think that's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.670 
a quick start guide so I think that's
pretty<00:01:57.509> much<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.110> outside<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.619> the

pretty much it for the outside of the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
pretty much it for the outside of the
box<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.340> mean<00:01:59.579> obviously<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.020> all

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
box but I mean obviously it's all

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.730 
box but I mean obviously it's all
recyclable<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.950> lovely<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.439> looks

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
recyclable and lovely and it just looks

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.950
