bring you another episode of what's in
the<00:00:08.620> box<00:00:08.800> today<00:00:09.190> I<00:00:09.340> have<00:00:09.790> this<00:00:10.090> gorgeous

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
the box today I have this gorgeous

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.220 
the box today I have this gorgeous

207<00:00:15.009> WRX<00:00:16.000> a<00:00:16.300> couple<00:00:16.900> things<00:00:16.990> about<00:00:17.170> the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
207 WRX a couple things about the

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.290 
207 WRX a couple things about the
subframe<00:00:17.770> I<00:00:17.950> want<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.220> point<00:00:18.370> out<00:00:18.490> first<00:00:19.030> is

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
subframe I want to point out first is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.230 
subframe I want to point out first is
it's<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.600> 4130<00:00:20.410> chromoly<00:00:20.740> steel<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:22.060> it<00:00:22.150> is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
it's a 4130 chromoly steel so it is

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.450 
it's a 4130 chromoly steel so it is
incredibly<00:00:22.660> strong<00:00:23.080> very<00:00:23.740> lightweight<00:00:24.040> in

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
incredibly strong very lightweight in

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.190 
incredibly strong very lightweight in
fact<00:00:24.700> it<00:00:24.820> weighs<00:00:24.970> about<00:00:25.120> 50<00:00:25.750> percent<00:00:25.870> less

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
fact it weighs about 50 percent less

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.500 
fact it weighs about 50 percent less
than<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.380> factory<00:00:26.680> subframe<00:00:27.160> well<00:00:27.790> being<00:00:28.030> I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
than the factory subframe well being I

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.030 
than the factory subframe well being I
don't<00:00:28.960> know<00:00:29.230> how<00:00:29.380> much<00:00:29.500> differ<00:00:29.860> significantly

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
don't know how much differ significantly

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.220 
don't know how much differ significantly
stiffer<00:00:30.670> that's<00:00:31.570> one<00:00:31.720> big<00:00:31.870> problem<00:00:32.050> with

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
stiffer that's one big problem with

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.680 
stiffer that's one big problem with
these<00:00:32.410> factory<00:00:33.010> subframes<00:00:33.460> is<00:00:33.640> they're<00:00:33.880> heavy

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
these factory subframes is they're heavy

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.950 
these factory subframes is they're heavy
big<00:00:35.260> they<00:00:35.890> flex<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:36.340> lot<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.880> o2<00:00:37.210> dough<00:00:37.330> 7wx

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
big they flex a lot and the o2 dough 7wx

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.890 
big they flex a lot and the o2 dough 7wx
in<00:00:38.110> particular<00:00:38.590> they<00:00:39.580> do<00:00:39.640> flex<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.060> lot<00:00:40.210> it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
in particular they do flex a lot it's

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.210 
in particular they do flex a lot it's
not<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.140> stiff<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.500> chassis<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.040> world

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
not the stiff is chassis in the world

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.310 
not the stiff is chassis in the world
and<00:00:42.430> so<00:00:42.520> having<00:00:42.730> something<00:00:43.090> like<00:00:43.390> this<00:00:43.750> can

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
and so having something like this can

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.470 
and so having something like this can
dramatically<00:00:45.040> increase<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.550> stiffness<00:00:46.060> of

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
dramatically increase the stiffness of

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.120 
dramatically increase the stiffness of
the<00:00:46.570> car<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:47.440> like<00:00:47.560> adding<00:00:47.770> a<00:00:47.890> chassis

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
the car so it's like adding a chassis

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.760 
the car so it's like adding a chassis
bracing<00:00:48.730> kinda<00:00:49.630> like<00:00:49.720> adding<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.079> cage<00:00:50.320> but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
bracing kinda like adding a cage but

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.590 
bracing kinda like adding a cage but
you're<00:00:50.920> replacing<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.489> factory<00:00:51.850> part<00:00:52.150> you're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
you're replacing a factory part you're

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.970 
you're replacing a factory part you're
not<00:00:52.630> adding<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.260> weight<00:00:53.500> you're<00:00:53.680> actually

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
not adding on weight you're actually

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.069 
not adding on weight you're actually
reducing<00:00:54.460> weight<00:00:54.670> while<00:00:55.390> increasing<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
reducing weight while increasing the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.880 
reducing weight while increasing the
rigidity<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> carb<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:58.440> also<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.800> know

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
rigidity of the carb and also you know

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.100 
rigidity of the carb and also you know
getting<00:01:00.250> rid<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.430> just<00:01:00.850> well<00:01:01.060> that<00:01:01.110> factory

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
getting rid of just well that factory

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.189 
getting rid of just well that factory
heavy<00:01:02.500> sloppy<00:01:02.950> subframe<00:01:04.019> obviously<00:01:05.019> there

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
heavy sloppy subframe obviously there

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.080 
heavy sloppy subframe obviously there
are<00:01:05.320> no<00:01:05.470> pushing<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.640> particular

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
are no pushing in this particular

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.940 
are no pushing in this particular
subframe<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.020> mounts<00:01:08.290> directly<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.830> the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
subframe so it mounts directly to the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.660 
subframe so it mounts directly to the
chassis<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.940> rear<00:01:10.210> diff<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.750> supported<00:01:11.670> with

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
chassis the rear diff is supported with

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.340 
chassis the rear diff is supported with
a<00:01:12.700> solid<00:01:13.300> mount<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.659> this<00:01:13.810> piece<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.200> actually

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
a solid mount and this piece is actually

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.270 
a solid mount and this piece is actually
a<00:01:14.560> CNC<00:01:15.159> aluminum<00:01:15.400> piece<00:01:16.290> beautifully<00:01:17.290> CNC<00:01:18.040> I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
a CNC aluminum piece beautifully CNC I

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.390 
a CNC aluminum piece beautifully CNC I
might<00:01:18.670> add<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:20.200> when<00:01:20.350> they<00:01:20.470> make<00:01:20.770> these<00:01:21.010> they

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
might add also when they make these they

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.030 
might add also when they make these they
can<00:01:21.790> obviously<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.420> them<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.720> jig<00:01:23.040> once

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
can obviously make them in a jig once

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.590 
can obviously make them in a jig once
they<00:01:24.190> weld<00:01:24.430> them<00:01:24.549> up<00:01:24.670> they<00:01:24.850> put<00:01:25.270> them<00:01:25.420> in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
they weld them up they put them in

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.020 
they weld them up they put them in
another<00:01:26.080> jig<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.620> ensure<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.490> know<00:01:27.580> fitment

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
another jig to ensure you know fitment

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.450 
another jig to ensure you know fitment
precise<00:01:28.420> fitment<00:01:29.200> let<00:01:29.860> them<00:01:29.979> cool<00:01:30.130> down<00:01:30.190> for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
precise fitment let them cool down for

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.640 
precise fitment let them cool down for
24<00:01:30.850> hours<00:01:30.909> basically<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.780> process<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.500> they

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
24 hours basically the process that they

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.180 
24 hours basically the process that they
use<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.310> very<00:01:34.020> tedious<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.409> suppose<00:01:35.890> because

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
use it's very tedious I suppose because

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.980 
use it's very tedious I suppose because
it<00:01:36.369> takes<00:01:36.580> so<00:01:36.729> long<00:01:36.940> but<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> ensures<00:01:37.869> that

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
it takes so long but it ensures that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.670 
it takes so long but it ensures that
everything<00:01:38.560> fits<00:01:39.360> perfectly<00:01:40.360> which<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.500> very

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
everything fits perfectly which is very

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.469 
everything fits perfectly which is very
nice<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:42.100> they<00:01:42.220> do<00:01:42.280> offer<00:01:42.549> several<00:01:42.939> different

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
nice now they do offer several different

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.660 
nice now they do offer several different
versions<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.560> particular<00:01:45.070> subframe<00:01:45.490> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
versions of this particular subframe and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.289 
versions of this particular subframe and
you<00:01:46.540> know<00:01:46.630> one<00:01:47.400> important<00:01:48.400> factor<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.090> they

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
you know one important factor that they

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.270 
you know one important factor that they
have<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:49.990> actually<00:01:50.290> get<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.740> with<00:01:50.979> you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
have is you can actually get it with you

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.100 
have is you can actually get it with you
know<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:51.610> shouldn't<00:01:52.210> say<00:01:52.270> variable<00:01:52.840> geometry

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
know I shouldn't say variable geometry

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.359 
know I shouldn't say variable geometry
because<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.070> know<00:01:54.159> you're<00:01:54.280> not

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
because it's you know you're not

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.890 
because it's you know you're not
adjusting<00:01:54.850> anything<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.510> get<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:55.780> if

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
adjusting anything but you can get it if
