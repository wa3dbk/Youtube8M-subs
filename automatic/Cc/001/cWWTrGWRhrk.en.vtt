 I first discuss the haircut 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.050
 and then the color so I can better 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.640
 match up 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.470
 We are here for one now 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.330
 medium length decided with one 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.980
 horizontal pony with one 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.760
 uniform levels of each type 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.770

 skin fits and just look like the whole 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.739
 makes something brighter 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.520
 if the color is specific we will work 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.320
 directly with the technology in diagonals 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.750
 balls on the whole head so really 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 a very beautiful luminosity arises 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.460
 with different industries 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.450
 when the coloration is finished 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.979
 i am starting with the haircut i 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.479
 Let's first determine my basic length 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.630
 how should in a middle area 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.630
 his 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.860
 in connection I start the hair to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.720
 grades in a uniform grading 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 gets the perfect look for the caro 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.649
 to the fortieth knee of the wildstyle 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.299
 series 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.640
 that makes a great product 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.070
 The hair is handy there is more texture 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.430
 and the hair just gets a lot 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.430
 stronger 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.689
 when he finishes playing is filled 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 the haircut gets here again 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.280
 just more personality through 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820
 selective prey by sickle-shaped 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 train tracks 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.470
 through the to peer technique I get 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.420
 more volume at the back of the customers 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.280
 just has more variation to style 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.340
 home and it is much looser and easier 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.930
 softer, I have to take care that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.550
 the tips do not get too thin 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.050
 that is crucial for my look 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.720
 the hair is very compact 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.820
 loose to facial contours of 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.860
 horizontal pony therefore just that 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.460
 face improvement frame and types 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.460
