00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.229
 Hello, good afternoon on this occasion 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:09.150
 let's talk briefly is not a 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:12.700
 technical talk about the configuration 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.109
 that can be done through a 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.499
 GÃ¼ey cash and a trusted gateway 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 objective with the goal of joining or 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:26.289
 extend analog telephone lines 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.400
 suppose you have two central 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.970
 telephone calls in different cities 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.879
 analogous 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.550
 panasonic for putting a brand has 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.239
 internet link in both together and what 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.180
 What you want is to join the two plants to 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.730
 through voip but without having to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.739
 change telephone exchanges 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.710
 then it is an alternative is to place 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.890
 an effective gateway inside one side and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.289
 the gateway that is on the other side in 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.219
 Here we see the screen as 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.559
 model the gx w 40 04 that is a boss that 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.460
 says of four ports we have also 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.740
 here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 the effective gateway 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.860
 the model fx w 41 04 of four positions 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.540
 what is the requirement first of all the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.570
 requirement is that they are all in the same 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.149
 network or have public ip both 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 teams in this example that we're 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:28.189
 making them on the same network on 41 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.789
 04 is the team 192 168 0 60 and the 10 may 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.860
 efe that this is 061 both are 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:38.450
 obviously in the same network 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.909
 ok very well what was done first is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.310
 update the equipment firmware 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.030
 what is recommended by part 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.179
 of the manufacturer after that in in the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.429
 case of tithe and fx to what is 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.880
 basically used to the ip 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.880
 static 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.259
 please come from those effects 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.329
 after that we do 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.749
 configurations in what is the field 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.749
 of the equine 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.129
 after that we configure the ones that are 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.800
 This is important because here we are going 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.540
 to allow configuring all the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.819
 frequencies and pedants that in the case 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.270
 that I am mentioning suddenly this is going 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.950
 to be a turned off if the values are worth 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.020
 but here too this is the point 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.570
 neuralgic where we say that the channel 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.980
 from 1 to 4 50 and 60 more where you want 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.520
 say that every time it's going to be a 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.260
 connection is going to place you two ports 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.440
 additional to avoid conflict 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.960
 well 99 to be highlighted by a 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.290
 specific port after that we're going 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.900
 to profile 1 and we indicate that we are going to 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.930
 we connect it yes and we put the ip here 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.810
 of the rs gateway we do the programming 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.080
 corresponding and we put no longer enters 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.140
 file 2 profile 3 are not necessary 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 active in this case is 1 but 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.590
 time for the case here what interests the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.280
 profile 1 done this at the fx gateway or 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.350
 in the game and fx we do the same 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.350
 we put a static ip in this case 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.180
 the 61 after that we do the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
 corresponding configurations in the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.260
 bank settings 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.939
 in profiles 1 we indicate that it is going to 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.230
 connect with him with the risk and the 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:26.500
 support team 60 activate the port 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.190
 we do the corresponding configuration 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.740
 and then on the effective option that 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.160
 require ports where we put here 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.110
 values â€‹â€‹that does not imply that they exist but 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.000
 This is where we indicate that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.430
 will register in each port ok 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 fourth one two three four doors that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.680
 a 50 60 with this configuration then 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.510
 we see that in the case of gerb and cash 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.519
 we will have a line connected in the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.769
 line 1 and it means that when 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.890
 Call this line or someone calls 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.280
 line 1 of the effective one should ring in 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.079
 the port fx 1 of the efficiency we are going to 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.859
 do a test I will dial the number 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.859
 telephone 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.260
 I'm going to refresh the screen and it will be 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.260
 artist who will make the call 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:30.190
 and the extension is already ringing because 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:30.190
 here it says ring and the call to the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.590
 action 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.460
 we close we close here it closes 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.200
 and here also social 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.840
 okay 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.510
 In this way we have verified that 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.510
 we have united through two teams 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.890
 a telephone line in the case of some 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.009
 Central what you are going to do is 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.219
 how to place on the cash side 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.889
 the extensions because they will be 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.599
 connected on the one side and in the case 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.930
 of the fx you could go as lines 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.839
 incoming to the analogous plant where 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.279
 you go to the calls and then the 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.689
 corresponding programming with the 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.330
 plants at home for the 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.180
 corresponding configuration throughout 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.639
 case if support or help is needed to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.080
 this type of configuration 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.300
 remember that we are online ecuador 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.469
 we are in guayaquil ecuador our 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.469
 user in style 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:50.670
 in 4 604 of 92 95 22 and online 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.240
 basically that we are in 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.240
 Guayaquil, Ecuador 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.300
 and we are exclusive representatives of the 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.060
 mark in sprint 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.530
 in this case we have prepared 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.650
 this video so that you have the 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.720
 basic knowledge of the configuration 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.849
 of these two gateways without needing 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.400
 use in the ip exchange to achieve 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.240
 condition this requirement is to have a 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.610
 network where the two teams have a 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.400
 ip fixed what they both say with ip 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.009
 public accessible from both sides 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.320
 With the desired color we are 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.720
 representatives and we sell equipment to the 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.720
 older and better very friendly and thank you
