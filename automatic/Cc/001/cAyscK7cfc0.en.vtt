and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.210> very<00:01:39.329> similar<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.320> watching

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and it was very very similar to watching

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.960 
and it was very very similar to watching
the<00:01:40.710> game<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> camp<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.520> against<00:01:41.790> Man

City that gave me a one-nil and it

around the box for messi and neymar and
it<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.540> seemed<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:24.990> though<00:02:25.110> he<00:02:25.230> wasn't<00:02:25.500> quite

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it just seemed as though he wasn't quite

being as clinical as we needed to be

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.600 
being as clinical as we needed to be
because<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.960> always<00:02:28.230> felt<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:28.980> some<00:02:29.010> stage<00:02:29.580> in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
because you always felt at some stage in

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.760 
because you always felt at some stage in
the<00:02:29.880> game<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.600> Juventus<00:02:31.080> would<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> goal

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the game that Juventus would get a goal

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.770 
the game that Juventus would get a goal
and<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.430> did<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.850> through<00:02:33.120> Alvaro<00:02:33.420> Murata

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
and they did that through Alvaro Murata

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.840 
and they did that through Alvaro Murata
I<00:02:33.900> thought<00:02:34.140> toasting<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.830> tonight<00:02:35.130> he's<00:02:35.640> got

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
I thought toasting and tonight he's got

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.640 
I thought toasting and tonight he's got
so<00:02:36.060> much<00:02:36.210> potential<00:02:36.600> he's<00:02:36.900> been<00:02:36.990> so<00:02:37.230> excellent

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
so much potential he's been so excellent

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.010 
so much potential he's been so excellent
this<00:02:37.740> season<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.730> Cup<00:02:38.910> matches<00:02:39.150> he<00:02:39.810> had<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
this season in the Cup matches he had a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.200 
this season in the Cup matches he had a
few<00:02:40.290> fumbles<00:02:40.680> I'm<00:02:41.610> not<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:41.940> sure<00:02:42.090> if

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
few fumbles I'm not really sure if

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.490 
few fumbles I'm not really sure if
there's<00:02:42.360> much<00:02:42.720> he<00:02:42.900> could've<00:02:43.110> done<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
there's much he could've done about the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
there's much he could've done about the
goal<00:02:43.710> possibly<00:02:44.370> could<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.610> parried<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
goal possibly could have parried it a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.720 
goal possibly could have parried it a
bit<00:02:45.780> safer<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.590> unfortunately<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.640> went

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
bit safer but unfortunately it went

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.040 
bit safer but unfortunately it went
straight<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.210> Murata<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:48.750> was<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> few

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
straight to Murata there was a few

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.990 
straight to Murata there was a few
corners<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.710> well<00:02:49.740> which<00:02:50.100> he<00:02:50.250> flapped<00:02:50.550> at<00:02:50.760> but

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
corners as well which he flapped at but

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.970 
corners as well which he flapped at but
more<00:02:51.870> about<00:02:51.990> there<00:02:52.320> was<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> few<00:02:52.710> players

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
more about there was a few players

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.220 
more about there was a few players
tonight<00:02:53.250> who<00:02:53.520> maybe<00:02:54.480> didn't<00:02:54.750> quite<00:02:54.780> play<00:02:55.110> at

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.050 
tonight who maybe didn't quite play at
their<00:02:55.380> level<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.830> thought<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.280> player<00:02:56.550> who<00:02:56.850> was

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
their level I thought one player who was

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
their level I thought one player who was
outstanding<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.080> mentioned<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> was

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
outstanding as I just mentioned and was

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.070 
outstanding as I just mentioned and was
named<00:02:59.460> man<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.850> match<00:02:59.910> was<00:03:00.570> Andres

named man of the match was Andres

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.470 
named man of the match was Andres
Iniesta<00:03:01.290> who<00:03:01.770> was<00:03:01.920> absolute<00:03:02.550> Goldust<00:03:03.180> tonight

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
Iniesta who was absolute Goldust tonight

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.640 
Iniesta who was absolute Goldust tonight
he<00:03:03.690> was<00:03:03.810> phenomenal

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
he was phenomenal

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410 
he was phenomenal
a<00:03:04.800> brilliant<00:03:05.310> assist<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.060> prestigious

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
a brilliant assist for a prestigious

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.090 
a brilliant assist for a prestigious
goal<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:06.930> wasn't<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.380> about<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.620> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
goal but there wasn't just about that it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100 
goal but there wasn't just about that it
was<00:03:08.340> his<00:03:08.490> movement<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.300> his<00:03:09.480> time<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:09.990> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
was his movement is is his time on the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.990 
was his movement is is his time on the
ball<00:03:10.320> he<00:03:10.470> allowed<00:03:10.710> himself<00:03:10.980> he<00:03:11.580> made<00:03:11.790> some

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
ball he allowed himself he made some

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.030 
ball he allowed himself he made some
fantastic<00:03:12.150> dribbles<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.560> thought<00:03:13.710> tonight

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
fantastic dribbles and I thought tonight

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.100 
fantastic dribbles and I thought tonight
we<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.490> saw<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.880> best<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.300> Don<00:03:15.480> Andres<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
we really saw the best of Don Andres and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.560 
we really saw the best of Don Andres and
again<00:03:16.710> in<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.160> big<00:03:17.340> game<00:03:17.550> he<00:03:17.880> always<00:03:18.030> seems<00:03:18.420> to

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
again in a big game he always seems to

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.330 
again in a big game he always seems to
do<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.810> he<00:03:18.900> always<00:03:19.050> produces<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> another

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
do it he always produces and another

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220 
do it he always produces and another
fantastic<00:03:21.000> performance<00:03:21.390> from<00:03:21.510> him<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.870> thought

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
fantastic performance from him I thought

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.620 
fantastic performance from him I thought
I<00:03:22.290> midfield<00:03:22.740> trio<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.790> most<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.270> game<00:03:24.450> did

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
I midfield trio for most of the game did

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.140 
I midfield trio for most of the game did
very<00:03:24.900> well<00:03:25.110> thought<00:03:25.350> biscuits<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> first

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
very well thought biscuits for the first

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.240 
very well thought biscuits for the first
half<00:03:27.330> certainly<00:03:27.780> dictated<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> play<00:03:28.680> he<00:03:29.160> was

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
half certainly dictated the play he was

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.880 
half certainly dictated the play he was
fantastic<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> tackle<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:31.500> apart<00:03:31.770> from

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
fantastic in the tackle but apart from

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.320 
fantastic in the tackle but apart from
that<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.190> thought<00:03:32.430> Leo<00:03:32.670> Messi<00:03:32.880> played

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
that I thought Leo Messi played

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.390 
that I thought Leo Messi played
strangely<00:03:34.140> central<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.770> thought<00:03:35.010> we<00:03:35.160> didn't

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
strangely central I thought we didn't

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.220 
strangely central I thought we didn't
see<00:03:35.520> much<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.760> him<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:36.930> Danny

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
see much of him on the right Danny

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380 
see much of him on the right Danny
Alvarez<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:38.460> again<00:03:38.580> was<00:03:39.360> a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
Alvarez was up and down but again was a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.360 
Alvarez was up and down but again was a
little<00:03:39.780> bit<00:03:39.900> too<00:03:40.140> far<00:03:40.350> away<00:03:40.590> from<00:03:40.650> Murata<00:03:41.100> for

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
little bit too far away from Murata for

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.370 
little bit too far away from Murata for
the<00:03:41.430> goal<00:03:41.640> Jordi<00:03:42.330> Alba<00:03:42.450> again<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.230> down

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the goal Jordi Alba again up and down

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.560 
the goal Jordi Alba again up and down
but<00:03:43.560> again<00:03:43.650> beaten<00:03:44.190> by<00:03:44.340> Litton<00:03:44.700> Steiner<00:03:45.000> for

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
but again beaten by Litton Steiner for

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.480 
but again beaten by Litton Steiner for
the<00:03:45.720> goal<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.710> say<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.160> don't<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.430> is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
the goal so like I say I don't think is

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.010 
the goal so like I say I don't think is
one<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> best<00:03:47.970> performances<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
one of the best performances of the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.840 
one of the best performances of the
season<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.310> shows<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.700> where

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
season but I think that shows you where

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.270 
season but I think that shows you where
we're<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.150> we've<00:03:51.540> won<00:03:51.780> 3-1<00:03:52.200> against<00:03:53.130> one<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
we're at we've won 3-1 against one of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.890 
we're at we've won 3-1 against one of
the<00:03:53.400> best<00:03:53.550> sides<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:54.060> Europe<00:03:54.330> this<00:03:54.450> season<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
the best sides in Europe this season and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.510 
the best sides in Europe this season and
Juventus<00:03:55.350> one<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.650> most<00:03:55.800> inform<00:03:56.220> sides

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
Juventus one of the most inform sides

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.180 
Juventus one of the most inform sides
certainly<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:58.020> won<00:03:58.230> 3-1<00:03:58.590> against<00:03:59.070> them

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
certainly and we won 3-1 against them

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.340 
certainly and we won 3-1 against them
without<00:03:59.430> really<00:03:59.910> playing<00:04:00.870> at<00:04:01.080> our<00:04:01.170> absolute

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
without really playing at our absolute

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.110 
without really playing at our absolute
optimum<00:04:02.010> level<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.430> certainly<00:04:02.730> tonight<00:04:03.000> we

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
optimum level and certainly tonight we

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.120 
optimum level and certainly tonight we
didn't<00:04:03.330> quite<00:04:03.510> finish<00:04:03.750> off<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.230> chances<00:04:04.680> to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
didn't quite finish off the chances to

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.160 
didn't quite finish off the chances to
show<00:04:05.370> our<00:04:05.550> superiority<00:04:06.420> but<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.960> so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
show our superiority but I'm just so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.480 
show our superiority but I'm just so
glad<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.710> won't<00:04:07.920> because<00:04:08.190> there<00:04:08.340> was<00:04:08.430> a

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
glad that we won't because there was a

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.220 
glad that we won't because there was a
stage<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.000> game<00:04:09.270> where<00:04:09.780> they<00:04:09.870> got<00:04:10.050> back

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
stage in that game where they got back

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.720 
stage in that game where they got back
into<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.590> where<00:04:10.890> they<00:04:10.980> were<00:04:11.100> pressing<00:04:11.580> us

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
into it where they were pressing us

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.160 
into it where they were pressing us
where<00:04:12.180> they<00:04:12.270> were<00:04:12.420> putting<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> pressure<00:04:12.960> on

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
where they were putting the pressure on

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.380 
where they were putting the pressure on
luckily<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.220> rode<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.430> storm<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.090> that

luckily we rode the storm and that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.760 
luckily we rode the storm and that
really<00:04:15.600> shows<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.960> attitude<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> players

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
really shows the attitude of the players

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.670 
really shows the attitude of the players
the<00:04:16.950> mentality<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:18.030> will<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.570> win<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.020> we<00:04:19.470> did

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
score it really was because there was a

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.530 
score it really was because there was a
chance<00:04:46.860> wasn't<00:04:47.220> there<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.640> was<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.910> header<00:04:48.210> it

me that's not a deliberate humble that

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.310 
me that's not a deliberate humble that
did<00:04:59.310> not<00:04:59.460> alter<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.120> way<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.660> ball<00:05:00.840> went<00:05:01.110> in

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
did not alter the way that ball went in

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.650 
did not alter the way that ball went in
it<00:05:01.530> wasn't<00:05:02.190> like<00:05:02.340> Diego<00:05:02.790> Maradona<00:05:02.970> when<00:05:03.540> he

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
it wasn't like Diego Maradona when he

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.440 
it wasn't like Diego Maradona when he
hand<00:05:04.170> of<00:05:04.350> God<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.890> came<00:05:05.100> out<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.610> was<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.880> direct

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
hand of God it came out it was a direct

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.270 
hand of God it came out it was a direct
force<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:07.170> hit<00:05:07.440> his<00:05:07.560> arm<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.950> way<00:05:08.070> through

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
force it hit his arm on the way through

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.560 
force it hit his arm on the way through
he'd<00:05:08.430> already<00:05:08.610> made<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.030> connection<00:05:09.480> with

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
he'd already made the connection with

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.330 
he'd already made the connection with
the<00:05:09.630> header<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:10.080> think<00:05:10.620> he<00:05:10.710> was<00:05:10.860> robbed<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
the header I think he was robbed of a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.770 
the header I think he was robbed of a
goal<00:05:11.550> there<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:11.880> I<00:05:11.910> was<00:05:12.030> really<00:05:12.210> sad<00:05:12.480> for<00:05:12.690> him

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
goal there and I was really sad for him

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.600 
goal there and I was really sad for him
because<00:05:12.900> again<00:05:13.260> before<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.740> game<00:05:13.920> he<00:05:14.430> was

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
because again before the game he was

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.130 
because again before the game he was
saying<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:15.000> was<00:05:15.150> dreaming<00:05:15.540> of<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.720> Champions

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
saying I was dreaming of a Champions

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.840 
saying I was dreaming of a Champions
League<00:05:16.290> final<00:05:16.680> goal<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.100> that's<00:05:17.460> why<00:05:17.610> when<00:05:17.760> he

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
League final goal and that's why when he

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.580 
League final goal and that's why when he
did<00:05:18.030> get<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.210> goal<00:05:18.450> I<00:05:18.480> was<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.110> pleased<00:05:19.380> him

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
did get the goal I was so so pleased him

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.330 
did get the goal I was so so pleased him
because<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.770> thought<00:05:19.860> he<00:05:19.980> had<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.100> great<00:05:20.310> game

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
because I thought he had a great game

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.280 
because I thought he had a great game
down<00:05:20.700> that<00:05:20.880> left-hand<00:05:21.270> side<00:05:21.540> he<00:05:21.990> was<00:05:22.140> always

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
down that left-hand side he was always

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.170 
down that left-hand side he was always
lively<00:05:22.620> always<00:05:23.070> wanted<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.370> ball<00:05:23.580> he<00:05:24.060> was

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
lively always wanted the ball he was

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.760 
lively always wanted the ball he was
very<00:05:24.420> very<00:05:24.630> quick<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.260> around<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.500> event

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
very very quick in and around the event

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.350 
very very quick in and around the event
of<00:05:25.860> offenders<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.580> he<00:05:27.000> thought<00:05:27.150> he<00:05:27.240> had<00:05:27.330> a

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
of offenders and he thought he had a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.550 
of offenders and he thought he had a
good<00:05:27.540> performance<00:05:27.960> tonight<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.350> really

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
good performance tonight in a really

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.580 
good performance tonight in a really
composed<00:05:28.860> finish<00:05:29.340> for<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:29.910> winning<00:05:30.290> goal<00:05:31.290> but

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
composed finish for the winning goal but

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.410 
composed finish for the winning goal but
I<00:05:31.650> thought<00:05:31.860> Pedro<00:05:32.310> had<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.850> big<00:05:33.060> part<00:05:33.270> in<00:05:33.390> that

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
I thought Pedro had a big part in that

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.790 
I thought Pedro had a big part in that
as<00:05:33.600> well<00:05:33.630> he<00:05:33.900> only<00:05:34.020> came<00:05:34.230> home<00:05:34.410> for<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.620> few

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
as well he only came home for a few

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.580 
as well he only came home for a few
minutes<00:05:35.100> but<00:05:35.220> an<00:05:35.430> assist<00:05:35.790> for<00:05:36.060> him<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.500> I

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
minutes but an assist for him and like I

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.800 
minutes but an assist for him and like I
said<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:37.800> thought<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.070> was<00:05:38.160> a<00:05:38.190> good<00:05:38.550> performance

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
said I thought it was a good performance

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.540 
said I thought it was a good performance
