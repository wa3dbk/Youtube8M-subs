you're<00:00:37.809> working<00:00:38.110> with<00:00:38.199> I'm<00:00:38.530> working<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:39.040> with

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you're working with I'm working it with

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.509 
you're working with I'm working it with
720p<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.870> put<00:00:44.559> whatever<00:00:44.739> numbers<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.280> happen

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
720p so put whatever numbers you happen

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.100 
720p so put whatever numbers you happen
to<00:00:45.610> use<00:00:45.729> you<00:00:45.940> can<00:00:46.059> also<00:00:46.210> change<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.690> color<00:00:47.019> of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
to use you can also change the color of

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.280 
to use you can also change the color of
the<00:00:47.620> frame<00:00:47.920> that's<00:00:48.280> going<00:00:48.489> to<00:00:48.580> be<00:00:48.610> around<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.059> I

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
the frame that's going to be around it I

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.890 
the frame that's going to be around it I
like<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> nice<00:00:50.530> neutral<00:00:51.070> color<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.299> a<00:00:52.449> sort

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
like a nice neutral color this is a sort

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.320 
like a nice neutral color this is a sort
of<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.049> 50-percent<00:00:53.620> gray<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.000> then<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.210> have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
of a 50-percent gray and then you have

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
of a 50-percent gray and then you have
to<00:00:55.449> actually<00:00:55.540> turn<00:00:55.989> it<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.839> my<00:00:58.989> small

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
to actually turn it on this is my small

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.520 
to actually turn it on this is my small
screen<00:00:59.650> so<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.540> pretty<00:01:01.540> much<00:01:01.720> takes<00:01:01.960> up<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
screen so it's pretty much takes up the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.680 
screen so it's pretty much takes up the
up<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:02.799> entire<00:01:03.010> screen<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.180> I'm<00:01:04.239> going<00:01:04.299> to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
up the entire screen so I'm going to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.570 
up the entire screen so I'm going to
zoom<00:01:04.720> out<00:01:05.049> a<00:01:05.110> little<00:01:05.199> bit<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.400> can<00:01:09.460> see

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
zoom out a little bit there you can see

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.600 
zoom out a little bit there you can see
the<00:01:09.940> frame<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.570> action

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.090 

you<00:01:17.610> begin<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:18.960> layer<00:01:19.259> make

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you begin by using your first layer make

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
you begin by using your first layer make
sure<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.369> unlocked<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.970> write<00:01:21.840> whatever

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
sure it's unlocked and write whatever

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.889 
sure it's unlocked and write whatever
text<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.640> animated<00:01:24.000> lock<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
text you want to have animated lock it

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.730 
text you want to have animated lock it
create<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.680> new<00:01:25.860> layer<00:01:26.509> trace<00:01:27.509> over<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.350> text

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
create a new layer trace over your text

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.609 
create a new layer trace over your text
and<00:01:29.539> you're<00:01:30.539> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> repeat<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.439> process

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and you're going to repeat this process

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.389 
and you're going to repeat this process
for<00:01:32.310> however<00:01:32.939> many<00:01:33.240> times<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
for however many times you want it to

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.630 
for however many times you want it to
loop<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.939> usually<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.649> keep<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> dot<00:01:38.460> an

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
loop I usually try to keep it a dot an

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.940 
loop I usually try to keep it a dot an
odd<00:01:38.939> number<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:41.490> usually<00:01:42.240> try<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
odd number and I usually try to have it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
odd number and I usually try to have it
to<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.340> around<00:01:44.580> nine<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.320> only

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to be around nine this time I'm only

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.449 
to be around nine this time I'm only
going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.830> do<00:01:46.950> five<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> quicker

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
going to do five just so it's quicker

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.139 
going to do five just so it's quicker
and<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.080> sure<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.759> lock<00:01:53.759> each

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and just make sure that you lock each

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.370 
and just make sure that you lock each
layer<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:55.890> accidentally<00:01:56.369> draw<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
layer so you don't accidentally draw on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.779 
layer so you don't accidentally draw on
multiple<00:01:58.380> layers<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.280> wrong<00:01:59.429> layer<00:02:01.789> all

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
multiple layers or the wrong layer all

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.529 
multiple layers or the wrong layer all
right<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:03.539> completed<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.319> last<00:02:05.159> layer

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
right there i completed my last layer

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.139 
right there i completed my last layer
now<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.569> need<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.280> save<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:08.519> export<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
now I need to save it or export it I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.249 
now I need to save it or export it I
haven't<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.509> figured<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.049> there's

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
haven't really figured out if there's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.009 
haven't really figured out if there's
any<00:02:10.410> difference<00:02:10.679> between<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.840> create<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
any difference between it create the

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.000 
any difference between it create the
file<00:02:13.380> name<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> be<00:02:16.010> select

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
file name that you want it to be select

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.310 
file name that you want it to be select
the<00:02:17.400> proper<00:02:17.880> directory<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.140> need

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the proper directory and then you need

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.650 
the proper directory and then you need
to<00:02:22.500> select<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.700> correct<00:02:23.910> format<00:02:24.390> which<00:02:24.630> is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
to select the correct format which is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.690 
to select the correct format which is
multiple<00:02:25.470> PNG<00:02:25.920> transparent<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:28.769> exports<00:02:29.549> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
multiple PNG transparent this exports it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.080 
multiple PNG transparent this exports it
out<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.329> each<00:02:31.260> layer<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.920> its<00:02:32.130> own<00:02:32.310> transparent

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
out as each layer as its own transparent

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.090 
out as each layer as its own transparent
PNG<00:02:34.160> save<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:37.440> some<00:02:37.590> reason<00:02:37.620> right

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
PNG save it and for some reason right

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.990 
PNG save it and for some reason right
now<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:39.030> get<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.660> error<00:02:40.019> just<00:02:40.769> close<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.130> the

I put it in animations and tests and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.920 
I put it in animations and tests and
then<00:03:27.170> we<00:03:27.410> need<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.590> select<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.690> PNG<00:03:29.690> and

here's another important thing frames I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.430 
here's another important thing frames I
usually<00:03:34.280> use<00:03:34.610> two<00:03:34.880> frames<00:03:35.210> for<00:03:36.170> each<00:03:36.230> image

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
usually use two frames for each image

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.860 
usually use two frames for each image
and<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.490> also<00:03:37.640> want<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.060> loop<00:03:38.390> especially

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
if it's a title so you can just stretch

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
there I have it it's pretty tiny so I'm

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.180 
there I have it it's pretty tiny so I'm
going<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.280> zoom<00:03:49.370> in<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.740> then<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.860> can<00:03:52.010> be

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
going to zoom in and then it can be

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.700 
going to zoom in and then it can be
stretched<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.240> fill<00:03:53.750> whatever<00:03:53.960> time<00:03:54.320> frame<00:03:54.350> I

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
stretched to fill whatever time frame I

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.750 
stretched to fill whatever time frame I
need<00:03:56.680> quick<00:03:57.680> test<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.220> that's<00:03:58.370> what<00:03:58.520> it<00:03:58.610> looks

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
need quick test and that's what it looks

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.760 
need quick test and that's what it looks
like<00:04:01.060> there<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.270> have<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.480> animated<00:04:03.350> titles
