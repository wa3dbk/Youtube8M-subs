00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
that's one and after we face the buggers

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.360 
that's one and after we face the buggers
that's<00:06:23.470> when<00:06:23.620> we're<00:06:23.800> going<00:06:23.890> to<00:06:23.980> get<00:06:24.100> into<00:06:24.340> that

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
sticky grenades so hopefully you have at

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.390 
sticky grenades so hopefully you have at
least<00:06:48.120> two<00:06:49.120> and<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.650> usually<00:06:50.830> takes<00:06:51.250> them

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
least two and that usually takes them

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.550 
least two and that usually takes them
all<00:06:51.580> out<00:06:51.790> throw<00:06:52.540> one<00:06:52.720> kind<00:06:53.050> of<00:06:53.140> to<00:06:53.230> the<00:06:53.350> left
