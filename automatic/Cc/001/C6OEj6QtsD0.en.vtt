00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that's configured a little differently

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.920 
that's configured a little differently
than<00:00:15.750> once<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> box<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.810> way

most<00:00:19.109> filters<00:00:19.560> work<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> filter<00:00:21.060> pad<00:00:21.270> here

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
most filters work is a filter pad here

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.320 
most filters work is a filter pad here
and<00:00:21.859> here<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> marine<00:00:23.460> land<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:24.000> some

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and here on the marine land now some

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
and here on the marine land now some
aquariums<00:00:24.840> they'll<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.160> side

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
aquariums they'll just be like one side

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.769 
aquariums they'll just be like one side
and<00:00:26.699> they'll<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> filter<00:00:27.300> pad<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and they'll have a filter pad but it's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.640 
and they'll have a filter pad but it's
all<00:00:27.930> essentially<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> same<00:00:30.170> your<00:00:31.170> water<00:00:31.410> gets

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
all essentially the same your water gets

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
all essentially the same your water gets
pumped<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.189> comes<00:00:32.730> through<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> then

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
pumped up comes through here and then

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.830 
pumped up comes through here and then
goes<00:00:34.500> through<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.860> filter<00:00:35.160> pad<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.840> this

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
goes through your filter pad now this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
goes through your filter pad now this
isn't<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> pad<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> basket<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.370> it's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
isn't a pad this is a basket but it's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
isn't a pad this is a basket but it's
full<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> polyfill<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.329> doing<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> same

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
full of polyfill it's doing the same

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.080 
full of polyfill it's doing the same
exact<00:00:40.559> thing<00:00:40.620> its<00:00:40.980> removing<00:00:41.430> particles<00:00:41.760> from

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
exact thing its removing particles from

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.319 
exact thing its removing particles from
the<00:00:42.270> water<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.520> water<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:45.000> goes

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the water so your water then goes

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
the water so your water then goes
through<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.020> removes<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> particles

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
through here removes the particles

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
through here removes the particles
cleans<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> essentially<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:49.469> your

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
cleans it essentially and then your

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
cleans it essentially and then your
dirty<00:00:50.460> water<00:00:51.680> we're<00:00:52.680> sorry<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.730> clit<00:00:54.000> your

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
dirty water we're sorry your clit your

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.049 
dirty water we're sorry your clit your
strained<00:00:54.570> water<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.050> should<00:00:55.170> say<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> goes

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
strained water I should say then goes

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
strained water I should say then goes
through<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.809> biological<00:00:57.989> filter<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.190> portion

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
through the biological filter or portion

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
through the biological filter or portion
of<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.850> filter<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> did<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.469> lot

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of your filter now what I did was a lot

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
of your filter now what I did was a lot
of<00:01:01.949> people<00:01:02.190> buy<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.370> baskets<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.329> put

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
of people buy these baskets and they put

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.460 
of people buy these baskets and they put
the<00:01:03.570> cartridge<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.049> they'll<00:01:04.290> put<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the cartridge here they'll put the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
the cartridge here they'll put the
basket<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.850> there's<00:01:06.030> these

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
basket over here because there's these

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
basket over here because there's these
little<00:01:06.330> slots<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> don't<00:01:07.020> even<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
little slots I don't even see them and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
little slots I don't even see them and
then<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.640> their<00:01:08.760> media<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
then they put their media in here and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
then they put their media in here and
that<00:01:10.619> adds<00:01:10.770> extra<00:01:11.070> biological'

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that adds extra biological'

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.899 
that adds extra biological'
I<00:01:11.909> did<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.909> filter

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
I did a little different put my filter

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.020 
I did a little different put my filter
floss<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.630> polyfills<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.979> stuff<00:01:17.189> views<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
floss or polyfills same stuff views and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600 
floss or polyfills same stuff views and
pillows<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.439> kind<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> stuff<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
pillows and that kind of stuff that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
pillows and that kind of stuff that
removes<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.540> particles<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.799> lava

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
removes my particles and then I put lava

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.710 
removes my particles and then I put lava
rock<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:24.259> which<00:01:25.259> acts<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.040> biological

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
rock in here which acts as my biological

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
rock in here which acts as my biological
the<00:01:27.720> good<00:01:27.900> bacteria<00:01:28.110> grows<00:01:29.509> on<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> lava<00:01:32.040> rock

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the good bacteria grows on the lava rock

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.819 
the good bacteria grows on the lava rock
in<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.909> bio<00:01:33.150> wheel<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:34.170> happens<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> as

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
in on this bio wheel what happens is as

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.080 
in on this bio wheel what happens is as
the<00:01:34.920> water<00:01:35.130> goes<00:01:35.310> through<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> eats<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the water goes through it eats the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
the water goes through it eats the
ammonia<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.530> bacteria<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
ammonia and there's other bacteria in

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
ammonia and there's other bacteria in
here<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:39.240> eat<00:01:39.450> nitrates<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.229> turn<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
here that eat nitrates that turn the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340 
here that eat nitrates that turn the
nitrate<00:01:41.040> nitrites<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:42.090> nitrates<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.259> what

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
nitrate nitrites into nitrates so what

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
nitrate nitrites into nitrates so what
happens<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> goes<00:01:44.130> through<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.090> one

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
happens is it goes through the one

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
happens is it goes through the one
bacteria<00:01:45.720> turns<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.200> nitrites<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> goes

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
bacteria turns it into nitrites it goes

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.810 
bacteria turns it into nitrites it goes
back<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> tank<00:01:47.579> gets<00:01:48.360> sucked<00:01:48.600> back<00:01:48.780> up

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
back into the tank gets sucked back up

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.950 
back into the tank gets sucked back up
sometimes<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> happens<00:01:51.299> before<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.659> goes<00:01:51.750> out

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
sometimes it happens before it goes out

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.139 
sometimes it happens before it goes out
but<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.310> bacteria<00:01:53.820> eats<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but then the other bacteria eats the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
but then the other bacteria eats the
nitrites<00:01:54.600> turning<00:01:54.930> them<00:01:55.020> into<00:01:55.140> nitrates<00:01:55.619> does

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
nitrites turning them into nitrates does

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
nitrites turning them into nitrates does
the<00:01:56.490> same<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:57.000> happens<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.689> bio

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the same thing happens on this bio

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.300 
the same thing happens on this bio
wheels<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.590> doesn't<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> only

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
wheels it doesn't here the only

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
wheels it doesn't here the only
difference<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> there's<00:02:00.360> different<00:02:00.630> kinds<00:02:01.110> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
difference is there's different kinds of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
difference is there's different kinds of
bacteria<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.680> grow<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.130> bio<00:02:02.369> wheel<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
bacteria that grow on the bio wheel that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
bacteria that grow on the bio wheel that
grow<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> water<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.369> bacteria<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
grow in the water the bacteria that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
grow in the water the bacteria that
girls<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.540> bio<00:02:06.810> wheel<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.290> need

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
girls on this bio wheel they need

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.270 
girls on this bio wheel they need
exposure<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.610> air<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.390> use<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.810> more

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
exposure the air they use up more

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.720 
exposure the air they use up more
-<00:02:10.399> didn't<00:02:10.700> -<00:02:10.930> process<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.040> essentially<00:02:13.520> by

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
- didn't - process and so essentially by

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.580 
- didn't - process and so essentially by
having<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.870> anaerobic<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.560> aerobic

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
having the anaerobic and aerobic

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.220 
having the anaerobic and aerobic
bacteria<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.660> almost<00:02:18.020> like

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
bacteria going on it's almost like

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.180 
bacteria going on it's almost like
double<00:02:18.500> filtration<00:02:19.069> biologically<00:02:21.190> so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
double filtration biologically so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.340 
double filtration biologically so
essentially<00:02:22.970> all<00:02:23.209> filters<00:02:23.780> run<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.140> same<00:02:24.319> way

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
essentially all filters run the same way

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.880 
essentially all filters run the same way
even<00:02:24.860> carpet<00:02:25.190> or<00:02:25.310> even<00:02:26.530> canister<00:02:27.530> filters

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
even carpet or even canister filters

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.250 
even carpet or even canister filters
even<00:02:28.100> though<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:28.340> might<00:02:28.489> not<00:02:28.550> have<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
even though they might not have this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.780 
even though they might not have this
that<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.709> bacteria<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.190> girls<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.610> bio

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
that the bacteria that girls in the bio

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
that the bacteria that girls in the bio
will<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.209> just<00:02:32.239> submerged<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.080> works<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> same

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
will is just submerged it works the same

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.860 
will is just submerged it works the same
way<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:34.459> filters<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> particulates<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
way they filters the particulates and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
way they filters the particulates and
then<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> has<00:02:36.860> bio<00:02:37.690> filtration<00:02:38.690> which<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.800> lot

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
then it has bio filtration which a lot

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.130 
then it has bio filtration which a lot
of<00:02:40.370> times<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.670> ceramic<00:02:41.180> media<00:02:41.390> which<00:02:41.750> actually

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
of times a ceramic media which actually

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.180 
of times a ceramic media which actually
eventually<00:02:42.290> I'll<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> ceramic

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
eventually I'll be going to ceramic

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.240 
eventually I'll be going to ceramic
media<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.880> too<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:45.010> anyways<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.160> does

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
media for this too but anyways it does

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
media for this too but anyways it does
the<00:02:46.310> same<00:02:46.489> thing<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.760> turns<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.150> into<00:02:47.269> nitrates

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the same thing it turns it into nitrates

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
the same thing it turns it into nitrates
now<00:02:48.350> nitrates<00:02:48.890> are<00:02:49.070> still<00:02:49.280> bad<00:02:49.459> for<00:02:49.730> your<00:02:49.940> fish

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
now nitrates are still bad for your fish

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
now nitrates are still bad for your fish
but<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:51.260> kind<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.769> lesser<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.190> two

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
but it's kind of like the lesser of two

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.520 
but it's kind of like the lesser of two
evils<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:53.090> not<00:02:53.269> at<00:02:53.510> nearly<00:02:53.930> as<00:02:54.140> bad<00:02:54.350> as<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
evils it's not at nearly as bad as the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.430 
evils it's not at nearly as bad as the
ammonia<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:56.600> why<00:02:56.810> when<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.200> are

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
ammonia so that's why when you are

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.970 
ammonia so that's why when you are
running<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.280> tank<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:59.660> should<00:02:59.900> have<00:03:00.080> zero

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
running a tank you should have zero

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.870 
running a tank you should have zero
parts<00:03:01.489> per<00:03:01.730> million<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.269> zero<00:03:02.840> ppm<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.880> ammonia

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
parts per million or zero ppm of ammonia

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.199 
parts per million or zero ppm of ammonia
and<00:03:05.030> zero<00:03:05.600> parts<00:03:06.200> per<00:03:06.290> million<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:07.209> nitrites

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
and zero parts per million of nitrites

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.110 
and zero parts per million of nitrites
now<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.050> nitrates

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
now you nitrates

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.940 
now you nitrates
and<00:03:11.120> some<00:03:11.660> people<00:03:11.930> will<00:03:12.019> argue<00:03:12.140> on<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.920> my

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
and some people will argue on this in my

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.979 
and some people will argue on this in my
opinion<00:03:13.489> should<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.760> no<00:03:14.090> higher<00:03:14.120> than<00:03:14.329> ten

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
opinion should be no higher than ten

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.330 
opinion should be no higher than ten
maybe<00:03:15.769> fifteen<00:03:17.110> when<00:03:18.110> my<00:03:18.290> tanks<00:03:18.680> get<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.040> like

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
maybe fifteen when my tanks get to like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.729 
maybe fifteen when my tanks get to like
ten<00:03:19.610> or<00:03:19.760> fifteen<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.510> water<00:03:20.780> change<00:03:21.019> now

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
ten or fifteen I do a water change now

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.380 
ten or fifteen I do a water change now
it<00:03:21.860> takes<00:03:22.070> some<00:03:22.220> about<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> week<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.880> half<00:03:22.910> to

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
it takes some about a week and a half to

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.940 
it takes some about a week and a half to
get<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.750> point<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.350> do<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> water

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
get to that point so I just do a water

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.180 
get to that point so I just do a water
change<00:03:25.220> literally<00:03:26.500> once<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.620> week<00:03:27.769> it's

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
change literally once a week it's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.830 
change literally once a week it's
usually<00:03:28.370> on<00:03:28.790> either<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> Saturday<00:03:29.600> or<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> Sunday

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
usually on either a Saturday or a Sunday

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.470 
usually on either a Saturday or a Sunday
I'll<00:03:30.769> go<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.400> I'll<00:03:31.459> do<00:03:31.640> all<00:03:31.820> my<00:03:31.940> tanks<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.329> do<00:03:32.390> a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
I'll go and I'll do all my tanks I do a

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.250 
I'll go and I'll do all my tanks I do a
complete<00:03:32.780> water<00:03:32.959> change<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.950> what<00:03:34.040> happens<00:03:34.400> is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
complete water change so what happens is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.759 
complete water change so what happens is
you<00:03:36.260> get<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.530> buildup<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:38.060> nitrates<00:03:38.959> from

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
you get a buildup of the nitrates from

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.400 
you get a buildup of the nitrates from
your<00:03:40.040> bacteria<00:03:40.400> eating<00:03:40.940> your<00:03:41.150> ammonia<00:03:41.410> builds

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
your bacteria eating your ammonia builds

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.160 
your bacteria eating your ammonia builds
up<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.650> your<00:03:42.739> tank<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:44.090> when<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.959> water

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
up in your tank so when you do a water

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.930 
up in your tank so when you do a water
change<00:03:45.530> you're<00:03:45.829> actually<00:03:46.220> removing<00:03:46.820> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
change you're actually removing the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.819 
change you're actually removing the
nitrates<00:03:47.390> from<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.720> water<00:03:47.930> you're<00:03:48.530> adding

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
nitrates from the water you're adding

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.349 
nitrates from the water you're adding
clean<00:03:49.070> fresh<00:03:49.459> water<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:49.970> now<00:03:51.430> some<00:03:52.430> people<00:03:53.120> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
water out of the tap and having like

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.449 
water out of the tap and having like
five<00:03:59.299> or<00:03:59.540> ten<00:03:59.720> nitrates<00:04:00.140> already<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.739> that

five or ten nitrates already if that

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.190 
five or ten nitrates already if that
happens<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.930> know<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:03.829> kind<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.100> up<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.220> you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
happens you know it's kind of up to you

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.530 
happens you know it's kind of up to you
you<00:04:06.200> can<00:04:06.380> either<00:04:06.500> go<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:06.980> use<00:04:07.160> RO<00:04:07.790> do<00:04:08.150> water

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
you can either go and use RO do water

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.120 
you can either go and use RO do water
which<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:08.959> kind<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.350> bit<00:04:09.500> ridiculous<00:04:09.859> in<00:04:10.100> my

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
which is kind of a bit ridiculous in my

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.460 
which is kind of a bit ridiculous in my
opinion<00:04:10.609> or<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.720> could<00:04:11.870> probably<00:04:12.260> wait<00:04:12.440> till

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
opinion or you could probably wait till

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.440 
opinion or you could probably wait till
you're<00:04:12.829> up<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.190> 20<00:04:13.549> parts<00:04:13.790> per<00:04:13.820> million<00:04:14.090> again

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
you're up to 20 parts per million again

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.860 
you're up to 20 parts per million again
that's<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.410> my<00:04:15.709> opinion<00:04:16.100> not<00:04:16.910> good<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:17.479> it's

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
that's in my opinion not good but it's

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.480 
that's in my opinion not good but it's
not<00:04:18.140> as<00:04:18.320> bad<00:04:18.500> as<00:04:18.739> say<00:04:18.950> 50<00:04:20.530> anyways<00:04:21.560> that's<00:04:22.340> just

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
not as bad as say 50 anyways that's just

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.770 
not as bad as say 50 anyways that's just
