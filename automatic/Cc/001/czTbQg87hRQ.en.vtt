good but tell us what kind of weather of
it<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.109> had<00:00:31.260> since<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.040> period

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
it have we had since that time period

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
it have we had since that time period
we've<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.660> several<00:00:33.960> rain<00:00:34.260> events<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
we've had several rain events and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.639 
we've had several rain events and
they've<00:00:35.100> all<00:00:35.360> been<00:00:36.360> relatively<00:00:36.899> light<00:00:37.410> ones

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
they've all been relatively light ones

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
they've all been relatively light ones
half<00:00:37.890> inch<00:00:38.190> no<00:00:39.120> morning<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.690> usually<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
half inch no morning it's usually and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
half inch no morning it's usually and
they<00:00:40.500> came<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.969> time

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
they came at pretty much the right time

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.100 
they came at pretty much the right time
we<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.960> seven<00:00:43.230> tenths<00:00:43.590> last<00:00:43.920> night<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> we're

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
we got seven tenths last night so we're

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 
we got seven tenths last night so we're
really<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.590> ideal<00:00:46.739> shape<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:48.000> moisture

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
really an ideal shape here for moisture

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.340 
really an ideal shape here for moisture
yeah<00:00:48.780> Gordon<00:00:49.170> looks<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.590> good<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.350> pull

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
yeah Gordon looks really good as we pull

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.139 
yeah Gordon looks really good as we pull
the<00:00:52.469> plan<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> field<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the plan out of the field here kind of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
the plan out of the field here kind of
shows<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.660> gross<00:00:54.899> stage<00:00:55.140> we're<00:00:55.350> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
shows you what gross stage we're in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.930 
shows you what gross stage we're in
we're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.100> through<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.430> pollination

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we're going through that pollination

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
we're going through that pollination
process<00:00:57.270> we're<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.379> done<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
process we're just about done we're just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
process we're just about done we're just
finishing<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> tip<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.359> year<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
finishing up the tip on this year the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
finishing up the tip on this year the
only<00:01:01.739> thing<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.250> seeing<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
only thing that we're seeing in the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
only thing that we're seeing in the
field<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> gray<00:01:03.840> leaf<00:01:04.080> spot

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
field is a little bit of gray leaf spot

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
field is a little bit of gray leaf spot
Rick<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> walk<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> field<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.450> gray

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
Rick as you walk the field how much gray

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.850 
Rick as you walk the field how much gray
leaf<00:01:06.840> spot<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> seeing<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
leaf spot are you seeing out in the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.440 
leaf spot are you seeing out in the
field<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> moderate

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
field here so it's just a moderate

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
field here so it's just a moderate
amount<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> spray<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> here

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
amount but we're going to spray it here

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.390 
amount but we're going to spray it here
either<00:01:11.189> tomorrow<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.150> Wednesday<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:14.070> keep<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
either tomorrow or Wednesday to keep it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
either tomorrow or Wednesday to keep it
in<00:01:14.549> check<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.000> make<00:01:15.240> sure<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.659> doesn't

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
in check and make sure that doesn't

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.399 
in check and make sure that doesn't
limit<00:01:16.409> our<00:01:16.619> yield<00:01:16.860> yeah<00:01:17.780> right<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> yield

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
limit our yield yeah right now the yield

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
limit our yield yeah right now the yield
potential<00:01:19.740> looks<00:01:20.070> amazing<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> probably

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
potential looks amazing this is probably

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
potential looks amazing this is probably
of<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> yield<00:01:22.530> checks<00:01:22.799> we've<00:01:22.979> done<00:01:23.189> thus

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
of all the yield checks we've done thus

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940 
of all the yield checks we've done thus
far<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.869> field<00:01:25.110> has<00:01:25.350> certainly<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
far this field has certainly got the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
far this field has certainly got the
potential<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.670> 300<00:01:27.150> bushland<00:01:27.360> matter<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
potential to go 300 bushland matter of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
potential to go 300 bushland matter of
fact<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.229> were<00:01:28.320> pulling<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.829> few<00:01:29.400> years<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.790> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
fact we were pulling a few years out of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.830 
fact we were pulling a few years out of
here<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.479> done<00:01:30.750> with

here and I know we're not done with
pollination<00:01:31.259> yet<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.340> were<00:01:32.460> counting<00:01:32.640> 18

corn to make it look so good right now
what<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.479> started<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> dry

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
what we started with was the dry

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.620 
what we started with was the dry
fertilizer<00:02:02.009> application<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.969> false<00:02:03.210> person

fertilizer application of false person

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
fertilizer application of false person
potassium<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.590> did<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> by<00:02:05.189> soil<00:02:05.490> type

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
potassium and we did that by soil type

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.869 
potassium and we did that by soil type
here<00:02:06.649> then<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.799> put<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.009> growth<00:02:08.220> regulator<00:02:08.789> on

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
here then we put a growth regulator on

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.200 
here then we put a growth regulator on
the<00:02:09.119> seat

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
the seat

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.430 
the seat
we<00:02:10.360> planted<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.900> but<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> row<00:02:11.680> started<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
we planted it but a row started on it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
we planted it but a row started on it
then<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.650> came<00:02:14.860> back<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.460> side<00:02:16.210> dress<00:02:16.480> to

then we came back and side dress to

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.250 
then we came back and side dress to
nitrogen<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.570> came<00:02:19.750> back<00:02:19.810> with

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
nitrogen on it then we came back with

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.070 
nitrogen on it then we came back with
about<00:02:20.440> two<00:02:20.680> gallon<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.070> black<00:02:21.250> label<00:02:23.820> probably

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
pounds on the plot that you know so that

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.620 
pounds on the plot that you know so that
wouldn't<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.100> our<00:02:51.250> limiting<00:02:51.730> factor<00:02:52.210> there<00:02:52.390> we

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
wouldn't be our limiting factor there we

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.000 
wouldn't be our limiting factor there we
want<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.900> make<00:02:53.020> sure<00:02:53.050> we<00:02:53.320> had<00:02:53.440> enough<00:02:53.470> being<00:02:53.800> on

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
yep and we pulled some nitrate samples

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.500 
yep and we pulled some nitrate samples
today<00:02:56.470> we<00:02:56.740> were<00:02:56.800> pulling<00:02:56.980> 12-inch<00:02:57.580> cores<00:02:58.330> out

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
today we were pulling 12-inch cores out
here<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.960> field<00:02:59.200> where<00:02:59.770> he's<00:02:59.920> got<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
recommendations were coming up that we

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.850 
recommendations were coming up that we
didn't<00:03:04.150> need<00:03:04.210> any<00:03:04.420> additional<00:03:04.690> end<00:03:05.140> as<00:03:05.320> we

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
didn't need any additional end as we

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.230 
didn't need any additional end as we
looked<00:03:06.070> at<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> areas<00:03:06.670> where<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:06.970> had<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
looked at the areas where we had the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.060 
looked at the areas where we had the
lower<00:03:07.480> amount<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.960> nitrogen<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.470> 60<00:03:08.770> pounds

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
lower amount of nitrogen the 60 pounds

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.100 
lower amount of nitrogen the 60 pounds
less<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.940> was<00:03:10.150> actually<00:03:10.450> saying<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:10.840> might

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
less it was actually saying we might

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990 
less it was actually saying we might
need<00:03:11.290> justice<00:03:11.650> ghostess<00:03:12.250> coach<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.580> nitrogen

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
need justice ghostess coach of nitrogen

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.910 
need justice ghostess coach of nitrogen
just<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.600> finish<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.440> we'll<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.770> see<00:03:14.830> how

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
just to finish so we'll have to see how

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
just to finish so we'll have to see how
that<00:03:15.160> turns<00:03:15.190> out<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> end<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.180> right<00:03:16.360> now

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that turns out in the end but right now

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.510 
that turns out in the end but right now
this<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.440> very<00:03:17.560> exciting<00:03:17.950> we've<00:03:18.220> got<00:03:18.370> some

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
this is very exciting we've got some

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.610 
this is very exciting we've got some
beautiful-looking<00:03:18.910> corn<00:03:19.330> out<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
beautiful-looking corn out here and I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.690 
beautiful-looking corn out here and I
think<00:03:20.830> we've<00:03:20.950> got<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.100> good<00:03:21.220> shot<00:03:21.280> at<00:03:21.490> hitting

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
think we've got a good shot at hitting
