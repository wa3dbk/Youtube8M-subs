okay so this is my hurricane 550 sorry
about<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.940> bad<00:00:09.120> light<00:00:09.480> i<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.650> installed<00:00:11.900> no

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
about the bad light i just installed no

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.350 
about the bad light i just installed no
it's<00:00:13.320> hard<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.740> tell<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.130> those<00:00:14.340> are<00:00:14.730> aligned

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it's hard to tell but those are aligned

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.290 
it's hard to tell but those are aligned
d<00:00:16.289> s<00:00:16.529> 6<00:00:17.130> 10<00:00:17.490> digital<00:00:18.119> servos<00:00:19.670> had<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:20.939> set

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
d s 6 10 digital servos had it all set

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.660 
d s 6 10 digital servos had it all set
up<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.830> take<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
up I was just about to take it out for a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.450 
up I was just about to take it out for a
flight<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> realized<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
flight and then I realized that when I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
flight and then I realized that when I
wiggle<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.300> steaks<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.590> fast<00:00:29.449> this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.689> all

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
wiggle my steaks really fast this is all

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.190 
wiggle my steaks really fast this is all
fine<00:00:31.289> even<00:00:32.099> though<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.700> see<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
fine even though you can see that the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.069 
fine even though you can see that the
elevator<00:00:34.790> servo<00:00:35.790> doesn't<00:00:36.239> quite<00:00:36.480> keep<00:00:36.870> up

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
elevator servo doesn't quite keep up

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.580 
elevator servo doesn't quite keep up
with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.739> two<00:00:39.350> like<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.829> behind

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
with the other two like a little behind

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.090 
with the other two like a little behind
and<00:00:43.590> also<00:00:44.059> when<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> move<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.320> sticks<00:00:46.710> really

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and also when I move the sticks really

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
and also when I move the sticks really
fast<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.149> happens<00:00:48.570> watch<00:00:50.600> see<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
fast this is what happens watch see that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520 
fast this is what happens watch see that
it<00:00:52.710> starts<00:00:52.949> gonna<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.550> yeah<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.629> goes<00:00:54.660> goes

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it starts gonna go yeah there goes goes

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.360 
it starts gonna go yeah there goes goes
crazy<00:00:56.750> like<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.350> giving<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> much

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
crazy like that I'm not giving that much

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.029 
crazy like that I'm not giving that much
input<00:00:59.579> watching<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.359> wiggle<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.469> cyclic

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
input watching i wiggle the cyclic

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.730 
input watching i wiggle the cyclic
sticks<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> nothing<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.150> nearly<00:01:06.960> able

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
sticks and nothing I'm not nearly able

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
sticks and nothing I'm not nearly able
to<00:01:07.860> move<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.909> fingers<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.479> fast<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.140> that's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to move my fingers as fast as that's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.800 
to move my fingers as fast as that's
happening<00:01:11.420> see<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.689> feel<00:01:12.840> slow<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.799> fine

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
happening see if I feel slow it's fine

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
happening see if I feel slow it's fine
everything<00:01:15.810> looks<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:18.020> faster<00:01:20.030> there<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
everything looks good faster there you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
everything looks good faster there you
go<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.460> these<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.790> super<00:01:24.390> fast<00:01:24.659> servos<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
go and these are super fast servos I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.969 
go and these are super fast servos I
just<00:01:25.650> wish<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.420> when<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.530> wanted

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
just wish they would do it when I wanted

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
just wish they would do it when I wanted
them<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:32.119> I'm<00:01:33.119> wondering<00:01:33.329> what's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
them to do it so I'm wondering what's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
them to do it so I'm wondering what's
wrong<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:35.360> my<00:01:36.360> setups<00:01:36.840> uh<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:38.180> guess<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.329> can't

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
wrong I'm my setups uh I guess you can't

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.960 
wrong I'm my setups uh I guess you can't
really<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.880> AR<00:01:42.350> 6200

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
really see it in there that's an AR 6200

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.749 
really see it in there that's an AR 6200
it's<00:01:44.970> blinking<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.610> actually

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's blinking because I will actually

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
it's blinking because I will actually
just<00:01:48.149> started<00:01:48.299> blinking<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.960> used<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> not

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just started blinking you used to not

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
just started blinking you used to not
blink<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:50.549> might<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.240> something<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
blink some might be something to do with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
blink some might be something to do with
that<00:01:54.439> putting<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.710> flight<00:01:56.340> power<00:01:56.990> 2650<00:01:59.210> battery

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that putting a flight power 2650 battery

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020 
that putting a flight power 2650 battery
on<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> test<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> usually<00:02:02.280> fly<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.820> with

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
on just to test it I usually fly it with

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.969 
on just to test it I usually fly it with
something<00:02:03.240> bigger<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.850> yep<00:02:05.850> there's<00:02:06.270> my

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
something bigger but yep there's my

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.580 
something bigger but yep there's my
possessed<00:02:07.979> helicopter

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
um don't know if it's a servo problem or

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.030 
um don't know if it's a servo problem or
set<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.370> whoa<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.239> one<00:02:14.420> was<00:02:14.569> really<00:02:14.870> bad<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
set up whoa that one was really bad so

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.200 
set up whoa that one was really bad so
yeah<00:02:16.970> there's<00:02:17.450> my<00:02:17.720> problem
