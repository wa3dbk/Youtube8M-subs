00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 so bud so today I will tell you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.809
 how to make nutritious sandwich on 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.759
 breakfast for this we need 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.080
 few pieces 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:20.730
 stork ham or similar meat 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.019
 several pieces of cheese 2 eggs of them we 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.349
 make an omelet microwave oil and 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.890
 respectively here is such a bun Olya 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:39.600
 for hamburger 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 all went well so first thing we 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.340
 cooked fried eggs and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.410
 microwaves 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.680
 this video is already recorded 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 I will leave a link to it under the video 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:59.780
 further what we do we take lubricates 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 your bun a little buttered 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 not much needed because all the same 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:14.360
 oil is not particularly useful 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.360
 small quantities 1 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.440
 and so 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.530
 again 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 so on comes this sequence 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.600
 sure to put our pieces of meat if 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 I would have a salad or salad sheets 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.110
 I would of course add them here drop your at 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.049
 I do not have have to make do with what is a 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.299
 in general, they were very welcome here 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:57.330
 they gave us a cheese why so because 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.759
 scrambled eggs are hot and now we will put it 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.209
 from above it will melt 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209
 tastier 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.350
 we get 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:45.020
 very hot and like that we lay on top 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:50.510
 our bun and here we have 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.030
 Here is such a morning sandwich under 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.230
 breakfast is very nutritious and healthy here and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.580
 we have two eggs and cheese and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.870
 ham 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.370
 Well, in general, delicious delicious tea 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.790
 Super, you can even take it as an option 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.130
 to work make yourself such a couple of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.700
 lunch fans had a bite 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.810

 enjoy your meal 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.410
 very tasty but we must give the cheese 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.410
