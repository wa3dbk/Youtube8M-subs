00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.030 
is available and I think it's unfair to
ask<00:06:39.640> him<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.990> move<00:06:41.410> up<00:06:41.590> to<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.770> weight<00:06:42.040> that<00:06:42.570> is

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
ask him to move up to a weight that is

going to i think that we would if it was

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.330 
going to i think that we would if it was
the<00:06:49.900> right<00:06:49.930> fight<00:06:50.290> that<00:06:50.620> he<00:06:50.740> would<00:06:50.890> go<00:06:50.980> down<00:06:51.130> it

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
the right fight that he would go down it

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.190 
the right fight that he would go down it
goes<00:06:51.430> right<00:06:51.580> fight<00:06:51.850> but<00:06:52.120> it<00:06:52.390> was<00:06:52.690> or<00:06:52.870> five
