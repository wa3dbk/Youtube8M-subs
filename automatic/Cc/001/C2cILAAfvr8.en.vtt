transparent<00:00:01.639> image<00:00:01.849> plans<00:00:02.149> for<00:00:02.389> modeling<00:00:02.810> in

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
transparent image plans for modeling in

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.380 
transparent image plans for modeling in
Maya<00:00:03.229> this<00:00:03.679> one's<00:00:03.860> done<00:00:04.040> quick<00:00:04.340> so<00:00:04.760> here<00:00:05.270> we

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
Maya this one's done quick so here we

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.940 
Maya this one's done quick so here we
have<00:00:05.570> the<00:00:05.900> end<00:00:06.050> result<00:00:06.380> of<00:00:06.500> what<00:00:06.560> we're<00:00:06.800> going

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
have the end result of what we're going

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.249 
have the end result of what we're going
to<00:00:07.100> be<00:00:07.160> making<00:00:07.610> today<00:00:08.000> as<00:00:08.629> you<00:00:08.839> can<00:00:08.990> see<00:00:09.110> the

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
to be making today as you can see the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.560 
to be making today as you can see the
image<00:00:09.469> planes<00:00:09.679> are<00:00:09.830> transparent<00:00:10.549> and<00:00:10.700> when<00:00:11.419> we

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
image planes are transparent and when we

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.930 
image planes are transparent and when we
look<00:00:11.780> through<00:00:11.809> them<00:00:12.440> from<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.400> front<00:00:13.639> and<00:00:13.849> the

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
look through them from the front and the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.759 
look through them from the front and the
side<00:00:14.179> views<00:00:14.599> we<00:00:15.230> can<00:00:15.440> model<00:00:15.769> as<00:00:16.300> seen<00:00:17.619> so<00:00:18.619> it's

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
side views we can model as seen so it's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
side views we can model as seen so it's
really<00:00:18.949> handy<00:00:19.220> way<00:00:19.340> at<00:00:19.460> work<00:00:21.039> now<00:00:22.070> these<00:00:22.550> image

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
really handy way at work now these image

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.630 
really handy way at work now these image
planes<00:00:23.000> are<00:00:23.150> just<00:00:23.300> NURBS<00:00:23.539> planes<00:00:24.519> that<00:00:25.519> we

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
planes are just NURBS planes that we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.120 
planes are just NURBS planes that we
attach<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.419> layer<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.230> that's<00:00:27.560> how<00:00:28.070> that

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
attach to a layer and that's how that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.630 
attach to a layer and that's how that
works

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
works

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.450 
works
so<00:00:29.179> here's<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.509> creation<00:00:30.019> in<00:00:30.830> Photoshop

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
so here's the creation in Photoshop

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.139 
so here's the creation in Photoshop
let's<00:00:32.329> just<00:00:32.660> grab<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:33.680> image<00:00:33.829> by<00:00:34.129> as<00:00:35.000> an

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
let's just grab this image by as an

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.569 
let's just grab this image by as an
animator<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:35.899> we'll<00:00:36.770> just<00:00:36.920> crop<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.100> down<00:00:37.370> so

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
animator and we'll just crop it down so

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.650 
animator and we'll just crop it down so
they'll<00:00:37.700> be<00:00:37.760> with<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:37.940> from<00:00:38.120> for<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.329> just<00:00:38.570> do

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
they'll be with it from for you just do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.020 
they'll be with it from for you just do
the<00:00:38.750> front<00:00:38.960> view<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.320> guys<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:40.910> just

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
the front view for you guys this is just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.510 
the front view for you guys this is just
a<00:00:41.180> handy<00:00:41.420> way<00:00:41.539> of<00:00:41.570> getting<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.289> ruler<00:00:42.860> grid<00:00:43.219> snap

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
a handy way of getting a ruler grid snap

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.900 
a handy way of getting a ruler grid snap
to<00:00:44.510> Center<00:00:45.170> our<00:00:45.289> image<00:00:45.590> properly<00:00:46.039> let<00:00:46.699> me<00:00:46.760> just

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
to Center our image properly let me just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.520 
to Center our image properly let me just
grab<00:00:47.000> one<00:00:47.270> half<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.660> image<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.140> just

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
grab one half of the image and just

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.900 
grab one half of the image and just
duplicate<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:49.219> always<00:00:49.489> good<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.820> have

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
duplicate it it's always good to have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.209 
duplicate it it's always good to have
symmetry<00:00:50.480> on<00:00:50.690> these<00:00:51.410> image<00:00:51.769> planes<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:55.129> we

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
symmetry on these image planes so we

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.189 
symmetry on these image planes so we
just<00:00:55.370> flatten<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.730> image<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.809> now<00:00:57.019> what

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
just flatten the image and now what

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.139 
just flatten the image and now what
we're<00:00:57.320> going<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.500> do<00:00:57.649> is<00:00:57.920> go<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.670> copy<00:00:58.940> this

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
we're going to do is go in and copy this

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.259 
we're going to do is go in and copy this
image<00:00:59.390> onto<00:01:00.350> our<00:01:00.530> channels<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:01.670> here<00:01:02.179> we're

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
image onto our channels so here we're

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.060 
image onto our channels so here we're
going<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.420> create<00:01:02.570> an<00:01:02.809> alpha<00:01:03.140> channel<00:01:03.469> which

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
going to create an alpha channel which

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.640 
going to create an alpha channel which
will<00:01:04.250> actually<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:06.080> image<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.590> we

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
will actually have the image and we

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.499 
will actually have the image and we
invert<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:07.549> alpha<00:01:07.790> channel<00:01:07.970> will

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
invert it and this alpha channel will

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.870 
invert it and this alpha channel will
allow<00:01:08.990> our<00:01:09.200> transparency<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.250> wherever<00:01:10.640> it's

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
allow our transparency so wherever it's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.289 
allow our transparency so wherever it's
black<00:01:11.180> will<00:01:11.509> be<00:01:11.630> transparent<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.000> back<00:01:14.000> into

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
black will be transparent so back into

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.420 
black will be transparent so back into
our<00:01:15.140> normal<00:01:15.560> color<00:01:15.740> Channel<00:01:16.100> we'll<00:01:16.189> just<00:01:16.310> make

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
our normal color Channel we'll just make

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.120 
our normal color Channel we'll just make
that<00:01:16.579> black<00:01:16.880> 100%<00:01:17.659> blacken<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.290> that'll<00:01:19.040> work

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
that black 100% blacken and that'll work

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.450 
that black 100% blacken and that'll work
out<00:01:19.340> really<00:01:19.579> well<00:01:19.670> for<00:01:20.049> our<00:01:21.049> image<00:01:21.530> images<00:01:22.340> in

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
out really well for our image images in

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.219 
out really well for our image images in
Maya<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:22.939> we<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.180> go<00:01:23.299> jump<00:01:23.659> back<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:23.990> Maya

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
Maya so we just go jump back in Maya

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.510 
Maya so we just go jump back in Maya
here<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.659> let's<00:01:26.659> just<00:01:26.930> create<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.290> NURBS<00:01:28.159> plane

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
here and let's just create a NURBS plane

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.399 
here and let's just create a NURBS plane
so<00:01:28.939> just<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.509> standard<00:01:29.840> nose<00:01:30.020> flame<00:01:30.259> you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
so just a standard nose flame you

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.600 
so just a standard nose flame you
duplicate<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:31.159> we've<00:01:31.280> got<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.430> couple

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
duplicate that so we've got a couple

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.950 
duplicate that so we've got a couple
here<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.720> assign<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> new<00:01:33.259> material<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.960> onto

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
here just assign a new material and onto

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.380 
here just assign a new material and onto
that<00:01:36.049> we<00:01:36.200> put<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.439> file<00:01:36.799> texture<00:01:37.340> as<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> texture

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
that we put a file texture as a texture

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.410 
that we put a file texture as a texture
so<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.750> has<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.079> 2d<00:01:39.530> texture<00:01:40.369> there<00:01:40.640> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
so it has to be a 2d texture there and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.090 
so it has to be a 2d texture there and
we<00:01:41.720> just<00:01:41.750> grab<00:01:42.110> our<00:01:42.229> front<00:01:42.439> view<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
we just grab our front view and it's a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.730 
we just grab our front view and it's a
PSD<00:01:43.399> so<00:01:43.909> that's<00:01:44.509> fine<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:45.619> you'll

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
PSD so that's fine now what you'll

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.469 
PSD so that's fine now what you'll
notice<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.159> when<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.430> assign<00:01:46.759> these<00:01:46.939> textures

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
notice is when we assign these textures

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.510 
notice is when we assign these textures
by<00:01:48.079> default<00:01:48.439> Maya<00:01:48.649> makes<00:01:48.890> them<00:01:49.070> transparent

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
by default Maya makes them transparent

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.789 
by default Maya makes them transparent
the<00:01:50.390> Alpha<00:01:50.960> Channel<00:01:51.200> is<00:01:51.259> automatically

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
the Alpha Channel is automatically

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.539 
the Alpha Channel is automatically
assigned<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:53.540> transparency<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.070> here<00:01:55.430> we

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
assigned to the transparency so here we

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.399 
assigned to the transparency so here we
are<00:01:55.579> we're<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:55.880> going<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.360> get<00:01:57.320> these

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
are we're just going to get these

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.200 
are we're just going to get these
proportions<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> images<00:01:58.640> correct<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.149> we

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
proportions of the images correct so we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.399 
proportions of the images correct so we
just<00:01:59.360> go<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.659> see<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.990> width<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.350> height

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
just go and see the width and height

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.639 
just go and see the width and height
ratios<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.180> we<00:02:02.270> just<00:02:02.450> go<00:02:02.570> into<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> scale<00:02:03.289> and

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
ratios and we just go into the scale and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.889 
ratios and we just go into the scale and
just<00:02:03.680> type<00:02:04.039> them<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> decimal<00:02:05.390> place

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
just type them in with a decimal place

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.800 
just type them in with a decimal place
and<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.770> will<00:02:06.890> get<00:02:07.130> our<00:02:07.399> nice<00:02:08.210> proportions

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and that will get our nice proportions

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.330 
and that will get our nice proportions
of<00:02:08.870> our<00:02:09.020> image<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:09.290> we<00:02:09.530> know<00:02:09.650> exactly<00:02:09.770> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
of our image so we know exactly that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.100 
of our image so we know exactly that
we've<00:02:10.460> got<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.700> same<00:02:10.850> proportions<00:02:11.420> done<00:02:11.960> to

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
we've got the same proportions done to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.250 
we've got the same proportions done to
the<00:02:12.200> same<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.100> side<00:02:13.310> view<00:02:13.520> here

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the same to the side view here

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.330 
the same to the side view here
it's<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.409> both<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.709> them<00:02:16.859> now<00:02:17.040> you'll<00:02:17.189> notice

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's like both of them now you'll notice

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
it's like both of them now you'll notice
that<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.700> artist<00:02:17.999> hasn't<00:02:18.150> quite<00:02:18.450> drawn<00:02:18.749> this

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that the artist hasn't quite drawn this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.839 
that the artist hasn't quite drawn this
picture<00:02:19.230> correctly<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:20.340> we're<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
picture correctly so we're just going to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.520 
picture correctly so we're just going to
move<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.450> pivot<00:02:21.629> point<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.139> one<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.439> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
move the pivot point of one of the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.559 
move the pivot point of one of the
planes<00:02:22.769> up<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.249> scale<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.030> down<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.269> little<00:02:24.450> bit

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
planes up and scale it down a little bit

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.970 
planes up and scale it down a little bit
so<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.840> matches<00:02:25.139> nicely

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so that matches nicely

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
so that matches nicely
Freeza<00:02:26.670> transforms<00:02:27.329> on<00:02:27.480> both<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.439> image

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
Freeza transforms on both the image

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.319 
Freeza transforms on both the image
plane<00:02:28.889> so<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.700> aerial<00:02:29.909> zeroes<00:02:30.209> out

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
plane so that that aerial zeroes out

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.449 
plane so that that aerial zeroes out
will<00:02:30.540> group<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.200> move<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> group<00:02:32.159> down

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
will group them and move the group down

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.229 
will group them and move the group down
to<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.930> correct<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.939> just<00:02:35.969> going<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
to the correct then we're just going to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.690 
to the correct then we're just going to
scale<00:02:36.599> everything<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.129> just<00:02:38.129> so<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.489> fits

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
scale everything up just so that it fits

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
scale everything up just so that it fits
our<00:02:38.849> grid<00:02:39.090> nicely<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.689> that's<00:02:40.019> how<00:02:40.230> big<00:02:40.409> our

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
our grid nicely and that's how big our

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.800 
our grid nicely and that's how big our
characters<00:02:40.919> are<00:02:40.980> going<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.129> be<00:02:41.189> when<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.459> model

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
characters are going to be when we model

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.179 
characters are going to be when we model
rotate<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:42.930> around<00:02:43.169> so<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.530> correct<00:02:44.040> way

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
rotate these around so the correct way

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.440 
rotate these around so the correct way
is<00:02:44.219> just<00:02:44.579> checking<00:02:44.879> through<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> front<00:02:45.359> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
is just checking through the front and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.879 
is just checking through the front and
side<00:02:45.599> cameras<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.230> make<00:02:46.349> sure<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.590> fine

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
side cameras to make sure that's fine

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.069 
side cameras to make sure that's fine
let's<00:02:47.579> display<00:02:47.909> our<00:02:48.090> orthographic<00:02:48.719> cameras

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
let's display our orthographic cameras

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.149 
let's display our orthographic cameras
now<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.040> move<00:02:50.489> them<00:02:50.700> back<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:53.040> they're

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
now and move them back so that they're

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.009 
now and move them back so that they're
not<00:02:53.310> intersecting<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.599> check<00:02:54.810> those

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
not intersecting just check those

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.659 
not intersecting just check those
through<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.349> cameras<00:02:55.680> again<00:02:55.829> hide<00:02:56.519> our

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
through the cameras again hide our

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.179 
through the cameras again hide our
camera<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.419> know<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.719> that's<00:02:57.810> fine

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
camera so that we know that that's fine

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.399 
camera so that we know that that's fine
and<00:02:59.189> we<00:02:59.340> create<00:02:59.639> a<00:02:59.669> layer<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.199> both

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
and we create a layer so it's like both

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.369 
and we create a layer so it's like both
the<00:03:01.980> image<00:03:02.189> planes<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.060> add<00:03:03.209> them<00:03:03.449> in

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
the image planes and just add them in

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.409 
the image planes and just add them in
and<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.159> create<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.849> them<00:03:06.000> reference

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
and we can create make them reference

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.819 
and we can create make them reference
and<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.629> means<00:03:06.840> they're<00:03:07.019> now<00:03:07.109> unselectable

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
and that means they're now unselectable

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.339 
and that means they're now unselectable
which<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.430> quite<00:03:08.639> handy<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.199> key

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
which is quite handy and you can key

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.990 
which is quite handy and you can key
their<00:03:10.530> visibility<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.159> off<00:03:11.400> nice<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
their visibility on and off nice and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.629 
their visibility on and off nice and
handy<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.389> layer<00:03:12.569> guide<00:03:13.409> as<00:03:13.620> well<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.609> just

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
handy in the layer guide as well so just

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.309 
handy in the layer guide as well so just
creating<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.269> sphere<00:03:15.569> here<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.870> check<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.230> our

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
creating a sphere here to check that our

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.170 
creating a sphere here to check that our
image<00:03:16.500> planes<00:03:16.739> are<00:03:16.859> working<00:03:17.099> correctly<00:03:17.250> they

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
image planes are working correctly they

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.360 
image planes are working correctly they
are<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:19.379> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.709> see<00:03:19.769> how<00:03:19.979> each<00:03:20.129> plane

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
are and so as you can see how each plane

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.689 
are and so as you can see how each plane
is<00:03:20.459> working<00:03:20.790> really<00:03:21.000> nicely<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.400> at<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> last

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
is working really nicely and at the last

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.610 
is working really nicely and at the last
step<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.150> course<00:03:24.419> is<00:03:24.659> just<00:03:25.259> to<00:03:25.379> name

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
step of course is just to name

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.679 
step of course is just to name
everything<00:03:25.949> correctly<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.180> that's

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
everything correctly and and that's

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.809 
everything correctly and and that's
really<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.229> a<00:03:28.379> transparent<00:03:29.220> image<00:03:29.250> planes

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
really that's a transparent image planes

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.989 
really that's a transparent image planes
in<00:03:30.060> Maya<00:03:30.389> with<00:03:30.720> layers
