00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
now I'm in a mountain environment and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130 
now I'm in a mountain environment and
the<00:00:40.829> checklist<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> five<00:00:41.640> points<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.960> right

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

in<00:00:43.230> front<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.440> me<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> spring<00:00:44.970> that's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
in front of me here is a spring that's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
in front of me here is a spring that's
gurgling<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:45.990> out<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> rocks<00:00:46.590> here

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
gurgling right out of the rocks here

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.370 
gurgling right out of the rocks here
nice<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.490> cold<00:00:47.880> moving<00:00:48.660> fast

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
nice and cold moving fast

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.290 
nice and cold moving fast
there's<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.130> pretty<00:00:50.430> big<00:00:50.489> outflow<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
there's actually a pretty big outflow of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.920 
there's actually a pretty big outflow of
it<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:53.060> so<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.150> five<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.900> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it here and so the five things I want to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.889 
it here and so the five things I want to
think<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.290> are<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:56.390> what's<00:00:57.390> above<00:00:57.690> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
think about are one what's above this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.600 
think about are one what's above this
what<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> source<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.860> this<00:00:58.950> water<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
what is the source for this water and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.960 
what is the source for this water and
above<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.920> which<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.100> can't<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.489> see

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
above me here which you can't really see

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.910 
above me here which you can't really see
because<00:01:03.450> I'm<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.079> a<00:01:04.199> small<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.649> zone

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because I'm just in a small little zone

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
because I'm just in a small little zone
of<00:01:05.070> trees<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.610> above<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.890> talus

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of trees but above me here is a talus

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.520 
of trees but above me here is a talus
field<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.149> goes<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.960> through<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.259> snow

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
field that that goes up through a snow

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.660 
field that that goes up through a snow
field<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.219> clips

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
field to some clips

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
field to some clips
there's<00:01:12.180> no<00:01:12.299> camping<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.409> no

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
it's not like a popular spot for
wildlife<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.259> here's<00:01:16.440> my<00:01:16.590> checklist<00:01:16.830> 1<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
wildlife so here's my checklist 1 is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
wildlife so here's my checklist 1 is
there<00:01:18.000> any<00:01:18.150> camping<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> popular<00:01:19.650> spot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
there any camping there's a popular spot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.240 
there any camping there's a popular spot
where<00:01:20.070> he<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.340> camp<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
where he will camp which is not is it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
where he will camp which is not is it
place<00:01:23.670> that's<00:01:24.060> frequented<00:01:24.570> by<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
place that's frequented by a lot of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
place that's frequented by a lot of
wildlife<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.670> oh<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.479> say

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
wildlife and it's not oh and I would say

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.430 
wildlife and it's not oh and I would say
livestock<00:01:28.140> give<00:01:28.350> cows<00:01:28.880> sheep<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
livestock give cows sheep and it's not

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.359 
livestock give cows sheep and it's not
and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.200> outflow<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.100> lake

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and then is it an outflow from a lake

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.520 
and then is it an outflow from a lake
and<00:01:36.270> sometimes<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.200> trickling

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and sometimes you have little trickling

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
and sometimes you have little trickling
streams<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.670> great<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
streams like this that look great and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.539 
streams like this that look great and
you<00:01:39.240> follow<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
you follow the

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.429 
you follow the
and<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.240> actually<00:01:41.390> comes<00:01:41.750> from<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.990> lake<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.259> try

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
and it actually comes from a lake I try

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.789 
and it actually comes from a lake I try
to<00:01:42.500> avoid<00:01:42.679> those<00:01:43.039> Lakes<00:01:43.429> can<00:01:44.149> be<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> source<00:01:45.500> for

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
to avoid those Lakes can be a source for

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.069 
to avoid those Lakes can be a source for
a<00:01:46.310> lot<00:01:46.549> of<00:01:46.729> Wildlife<00:01:47.210> will<00:01:47.450> travel<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.960> those

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
a lot of Wildlife will travel to those

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.069 
a lot of Wildlife will travel to those
lakes<00:01:48.729> but<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.880> people<00:01:50.210> like<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.600> camp<00:01:50.840> I

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
lakes but in people like the camp I

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.139 
lakes but in people like the camp I
think<00:01:51.310> then<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.670> water<00:01:52.789> could<00:01:53.030> be

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
think then that water could be

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.990 
think then that water could be
contaminated<00:01:53.179> because<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.000> fourth

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
contaminated because of that the fourth

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.539 
contaminated because of that the fourth
thing<00:01:56.359> is<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.710> coming<00:01:57.920> straight<00:01:58.310> out<00:01:58.369> of

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
thing is is it coming straight out of

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.399 
thing is is it coming straight out of
the<00:01:58.700> ground<00:01:58.969> or<00:01:59.210> straight<00:01:59.450> out<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.719> rocks<00:01:59.929> and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
the ground or straight out of rocks and

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.990 
the ground or straight out of rocks and
if<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:00.890> get<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.159> as<00:02:01.280> close<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.819> source

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
if I can get it as close to the source

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.999 
if I can get it as close to the source
as<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.360> can<00:02:02.569> I'll<00:02:02.719> do<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.079> right<00:02:03.590> above<00:02:03.829> me

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
as I can I'll do that right above me

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.469 
as I can I'll do that right above me
