and<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.729> too<00:01:29.880> sure<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.329> confirm<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and not too sure if I confirm that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
and not too sure if I confirm that
though<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.680> thing<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.579> say<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
though now one thing which I will say is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
though now one thing which I will say is
that<00:01:33.030> these<00:01:33.329> remarks<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.170> confirmed

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that these remarks like confirmed

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
that these remarks like confirmed
awarded<00:01:35.340> trademarks<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.060> were<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.450> filed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
awarded trademarks these were just filed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
awarded trademarks these were just filed
one<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.610> another<00:01:38.820> dark<00:01:39.150> below

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
one so it could be another dark below

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
one so it could be another dark below
but<00:01:40.170> yeah<00:01:40.650> let's<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.130> through<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
but yeah let's just go through the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
but yeah let's just go through the
different<00:01:41.460> options<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.270> even<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.960> this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
different options because even if this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
different options because even if this
is<00:01:43.350> absolute<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> good

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is absolute which is good

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
is absolute which is good
chance<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.869> least<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> little

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
chance it will be it's at least a little

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
chance it will be it's at least a little
bit<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> fun<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.009> talk<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.869> do

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
bit of fun to talk about right so how do

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
bit of fun to talk about right so how do
we<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.560> World<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.860> Warcraft<00:01:50.220> honestly

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
we think it's World of Warcraft honestly

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
we think it's World of Warcraft honestly
it<00:01:50.850> doesn't<00:01:51.119> sound<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.689> Warcraft<00:01:52.229> II<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> me

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it doesn't sound very Warcraft II to me

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
it doesn't sound very Warcraft II to me
also<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.460> mean<00:01:53.610> visible<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.210> two

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
also would mean visible to have two

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.230 
also would mean visible to have two
expansions<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> acronym<00:01:56.009> hods<00:01:56.820> fun

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

part of the swarm so yeah I just don't
think<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> sounds<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.329> Warcraft<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.140> we

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
think it sounds very Warcraft because we

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.719

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910 
people suggested that it could actually
be<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.980> rebound<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.819> blizzard<00:03:12.420> all-stars<00:03:12.920> now

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
be a rebound of blizzard all-stars now

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.110 
be a rebound of blizzard all-stars now
this<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.519> interesting<00:03:15.030> because

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
this would be interesting because

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.900 
this would be interesting because
blizzard<00:03:15.540> all-stars<00:03:15.739> that<00:03:16.739> name<00:03:17.040> appeals<00:03:17.579> to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
blizzard all-stars that name appeals to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
blizzard all-stars that name appeals to
people<00:03:18.269> who<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.600> about<00:03:18.630> Blizzard<00:03:19.350> name<00:03:19.530> know

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
people who know about Blizzard name know

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.770 
people who know about Blizzard name know
about<00:03:19.859> starcraft<00:03:20.250> warcraft<00:03:20.790> etc<00:03:21.239> whereas

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
about starcraft warcraft etc whereas

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.199 
about starcraft warcraft etc whereas
heroes<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.319> storm<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:23.579> know<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.880> just

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
heroes of the storm you know it just

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.150 
heroes of the storm you know it just
sounds<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> MOBA<00:03:25.200> game<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.620> said<00:03:25.950> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
sounds like a MOBA game that said I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.440 
sounds like a MOBA game that said I
think<00:03:26.190> here's<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.760> storm<00:03:27.000> sounds<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.389> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
think here's the storm sounds like a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.789 
think here's the storm sounds like a
very<00:03:27.600> generic<00:03:27.810> mobile<00:03:28.440> game<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.709> doesn't

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
very generic mobile game it doesn't

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.030 
very generic mobile game it doesn't
sound<00:03:29.130> very<00:03:29.310> interesting<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:31.560> think<00:03:31.650> those

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
sound very interesting and I think those

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.199 
sound very interesting and I think those
are<00:03:32.100> all<00:03:32.280> stars<00:03:32.579> they<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.940> their<00:03:33.090> own<00:03:33.120> little

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
are all stars they have their own little

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.640 
are all stars they have their own little
identity<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.410> all<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
identity that would have all the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.170 
identity that would have all the
blizzard<00:03:34.980> characters<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.790> stuff<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.120> that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
blizzard characters and stuff like that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.629 
blizzard characters and stuff like that
so<00:03:36.600> I'm<00:03:37.440> going<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.799> say<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> actually

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
so I'm going to say that I actually

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.099 
so I'm going to say that I actually
don't<00:03:38.970> think<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.329> would<00:03:39.420> make<00:03:39.540> much<00:03:39.750> sense<00:03:39.780> for

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
don't think it would make much sense for

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.800 
don't think it would make much sense for
to<00:03:40.350> blizzard<00:03:40.709> all-stars<00:03:40.910> now<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:41.970> next<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
to blizzard all-stars now the next and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
to blizzard all-stars now the next and
final<00:03:43.049> thing<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.560> could<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> new

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
final thing that it could be is a new

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.190 
final thing that it could be is a new
game<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.299> know<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.600> team<00:03:45.780> 5<00:03:46.019> is

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.349 
game and we do know the team 5 is
working<00:03:46.530> something<00:03:46.859> we<00:03:47.549> don't<00:03:47.609> know<00:03:47.760> what<00:03:48.030> but
