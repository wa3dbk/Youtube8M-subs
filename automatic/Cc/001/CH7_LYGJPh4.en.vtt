piece in great detail we're just going
to<00:01:00.690> look<00:01:00.839> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> first<00:01:01.320> two<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.649> three<00:01:01.859> phases

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to look at the first two or three phases

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.359 
to look at the first two or three phases
to<00:01:02.969> try<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.140> idea<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
dance between the Thunder fingers we'll

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.080 
dance between the Thunder fingers we'll
just<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.429> the<00:01:08.550> chords<00:01:08.910> that<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just take a look at the chords that we

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.419 
just take a look at the chords that we
use<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.410> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
use so that you know what kind of

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.120 
use so that you know what kind of
progression<00:01:12.000> were<00:01:12.119> using<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> basic<00:01:13.890> G

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
progression were using we have a basic G

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
progression were using we have a basic G
chord<00:01:14.429> and<00:01:14.810> where<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:15.960> G<00:01:16.259> chord<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.800> without

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
chord and where would G chord be without

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
chord and where would G chord be without
g7<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:20.100> simple<00:01:20.880> C<00:01:21.090> chord<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
g7 we have a see a simple C chord and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.230 
g7 we have a see a simple C chord and
then<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.289> full<00:01:22.530> C<00:01:22.830> court<00:01:23.190> were<00:01:23.580> both<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> base

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
then a full C court were both a base

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.830 
then a full C court were both a base
notes<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.750> held<00:01:24.929> down<00:01:26.540> sometimes<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.720> we're

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
notes are held down sometimes if we're

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
notes are held down sometimes if we're
holding<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> basic<00:01:28.890> C<00:01:29.159> chord<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.729> our

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
holding the basic C chord down our

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.990 
holding the basic C chord down our
finger<00:01:30.630> might<00:01:30.810> move<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> base<00:01:32.250> E<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
finger might move over to the base E and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300 
finger might move over to the base E and
form<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.810> chords<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> beginning

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
form the chords you see on the beginning

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.760 
form the chords you see on the beginning
of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> second<00:01:35.970> row<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.579> c7<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
of the second row and then we have c7 a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.830 
of the second row and then we have c7 a
normal<00:01:40.770> a7<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> bar<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> second<00:01:42.689> fret

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
normal a7 with a bar on the second fret

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
normal a7 with a bar on the second fret
and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:44.000> half<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.299> d7<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> always<00:01:46.890> played<00:01:47.130> d7

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and then half of a d7 I always played d7

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.149 
and then half of a d7 I always played d7
on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> basis<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.890> play<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
on the basis that if I don't play the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.270 
on the basis that if I don't play the
last<00:01:50.310> note<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.509> fret<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.280> here

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
last note then I don't fret it and here

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609 
last note then I don't fret it and here
we<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.430> four<00:01:53.909> variations<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> F<00:01:55.140> chord

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
we have four variations on the F chord

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
we have four variations on the F chord
you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.789> most<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> F<00:01:57.750> chord<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you can see that most of the F chord is

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.700 
you can see that most of the F chord is
played<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> full<00:01:59.789> chord<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.840> played<00:02:01.530> in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
played not as a full chord but played in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.319 
played not as a full chord but played in
a<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> leaves<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.430> little<00:02:02.549> finger<00:02:03.060> free

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a way that leaves a little finger free

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.660 
a way that leaves a little finger free
to<00:02:03.750> move<00:02:03.930> around<00:02:04.109> on<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> treble<00:02:04.829> strings

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
to move around on the treble strings

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.059 
to move around on the treble strings
listen<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.689> music<00:02:07.810> again<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.530> try<00:02:09.009> and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
separate the fun beat and the treble

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.899 
separate the fun beat and the treble
beats

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.149 

we<00:02:18.909> can<00:02:19.090> hear<00:02:19.269> those<00:02:19.420> two<00:02:19.629> things<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.349> on<00:02:20.530> we

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
we can hear those two things going on we

can hear the thumb beat and the nice
melody<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.250> trebles<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:25.719> thumb<00:02:25.959> beat<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
melody on the trebles the thumb beat is

00:02:26.739 --> 00:03:14.990 
melody on the trebles the thumb beat is
actually<00:02:27.159> sounding<00:02:27.609> like<00:02:27.700> this

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.729 

so<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.120> can<00:03:16.269> see<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.719> instead<00:03:17.469> of<00:03:17.530> just

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
so we can see that instead of just

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.220 
so we can see that instead of just
alternating<00:03:18.159> on<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.909> basis<00:03:20.310> simply<00:03:22.230> it's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
alternating on the basis simply it's

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.199 
alternating on the basis simply it's
dancing<00:03:23.890> itself<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.579> making<00:03:24.939> its<00:03:25.120> own

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
dancing itself it's making its own

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.380 
dancing itself it's making its own
little<00:03:25.450> tube<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.709> at<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.950> same<00:03:27.159> time<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
little tube and at the same time the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:59.250 
little tube and at the same time the
basic<00:03:28.810> melody<00:03:28.989> sounds<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.769> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.930 

you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.070 

you

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.720 

which<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.230> very<00:04:12.410> simple<00:04:12.710> of<00:04:13.220> course<00:04:13.430> when<00:04:13.610> we

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
which is very simple of course when we

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.750 
which is very simple of course when we
add<00:04:13.910> both<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.750> base<00:04:14.990> and<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:16.040> thumb<00:04:16.280> beat<00:04:16.520> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
add both the base and the thumb beat and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.910 
add both the base and the thumb beat and
the<00:04:16.970> finger<00:04:17.300> beat<00:04:17.450> together<00:04:17.660> we<00:04:18.560> introduce

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
the finger beat together we introduce

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.340 
the finger beat together we introduce
this<00:04:19.130> lovely<00:04:19.700> syncopation<00:04:20.570> between<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.170> two

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
this lovely syncopation between the two

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.790 
this lovely syncopation between the two
melodies<00:04:23.230> it's<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.320> little<00:04:24.440> bit<00:04:24.560> more

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
melodies it's a little bit more

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.980 
melodies it's a little bit more
complicated<00:04:25.130> than<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.670> because<00:04:26.510> at<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
complicated than that because at the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.390 
complicated than that because at the
moment<00:04:27.020> would<00:04:27.320> play<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.530> melody<00:04:27.830> with<00:04:28.220> one

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
moment would play the melody with one

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:55.640 
moment would play the melody with one
finger<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.720> sounds<00:04:30.050> like<00:04:30.080> this

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.750 

in<00:04:56.650> order<00:04:56.920> to<00:04:56.950> make<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.280> music<00:04:57.400> more

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
in order to make the music more

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.720 
in order to make the music more
interesting<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.560> instead<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.430> playing<00:05:00.610> the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
interesting so instead of playing the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.330 
interesting so instead of playing the
basic<00:05:01.150> melody<00:05:01.330> with<00:05:01.660> one<00:05:01.840> finger<00:05:02.110> we<00:05:02.920> start<00:05:03.190> to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
basic melody with one finger we start to

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.100 
basic melody with one finger we start to
introduce<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.760> second<00:05:04.330> finger<00:05:04.810> and

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
introduce the second finger and

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.260 
introduce the second finger and
introduce<00:05:05.890> grace<00:05:06.250> notes<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.790> between<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
introduce grace notes in between the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.990 
introduce grace notes in between the
main<00:05:07.450> notes<00:05:07.980> this<00:05:08.980> is<00:05:09.220> how<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.580> sounds<00:05:09.910> with

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
main notes this is how it sounds with

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.729 
main notes this is how it sounds with
one<00:05:10.210> finger<00:05:10.480> playing<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> melody

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:14.739 

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:17.709 

and<00:05:15.739> this<00:05:16.039> is<00:05:16.189> with<00:05:16.399> a<00:05:16.639> couple<00:05:17.029> of<00:05:17.089> grace<00:05:17.360> notes

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
and this is with a couple of grace notes

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.540 
and this is with a couple of grace notes
thrown<00:05:18.080> in<00:05:18.259> before<00:05:18.589> the<00:05:18.739> main<00:05:18.919> notes

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.580 

now<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:24.729> means<00:05:25.060> instead<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.930> using<00:05:26.199> the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
now this means instead of using the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.469 
now this means instead of using the
first<00:05:27.160> thing<00:05:27.430> for<00:05:27.699> the<00:05:27.789> melody<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.300> whole

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
first thing for the melody the whole

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.629 
first thing for the melody the whole
time<00:05:28.780> we'll<00:05:29.410> be<00:05:29.530> using<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.860> second<00:05:30.310> finger

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
time we'll be using the second finger

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.980 
time we'll be using the second finger
because<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.000> first<00:05:31.240> finger<00:05:31.509> will<00:05:31.750> be<00:05:31.810> hitting

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
because the first finger will be hitting

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:45.470 
because the first finger will be hitting
the<00:05:32.110> grace<00:05:32.440> note<00:05:32.470> before<00:05:32.979> it

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:58.219 

you

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.350 

of<00:05:59.229> course<00:05:59.499> if<00:05:59.949> we<00:06:00.189> introduced<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.849> many<00:06:00.999> grace

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
of course if we introduced to many grace

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.749 
of course if we introduced to many grace
notes<00:06:01.689> then<00:06:02.259> it<00:06:02.379> becomes<00:06:02.649> over<00:06:03.009> complicated

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
notes then it becomes over complicated

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.179 
notes then it becomes over complicated
and<00:06:04.089> it<00:06:04.300> loses<00:06:04.479> its<00:06:04.809> attractiveness<00:06:05.409> so<00:06:06.099> we

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
and it loses its attractiveness so we

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.189 
and it loses its attractiveness so we
need<00:06:06.339> to<00:06:06.459> use<00:06:06.639> them<00:06:06.819> sparingly<00:06:06.999> and<00:06:07.779> just

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
need to use them sparingly and just

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:17.550 
need to use them sparingly and just
include<00:06:08.619> them<00:06:08.830> where<00:06:09.009> they're<00:06:09.189> attractive

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.960 

and<00:06:18.560> of<00:06:18.650> course<00:06:18.740> making<00:06:19.159> very<00:06:19.520> where<00:06:19.789> these

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
and of course making very where these

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.730 
and of course making very where these
grace<00:06:20.300> notes<00:06:20.569> appear<00:06:21.020> so<00:06:21.500> that<00:06:21.650> we<00:06:21.710> have

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
grace notes appear so that we have

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.570 
grace notes appear so that we have
variations<00:06:22.669> throughout<00:06:23.000> music<00:06:24.190> any<00:06:25.190> time<00:06:25.460> you

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
variations throughout music any time you

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.339 
variations throughout music any time you
start<00:06:25.639> to<00:06:26.000> learn<00:06:26.150> a<00:06:26.210> new<00:06:26.330> piece<00:06:26.750> of<00:06:26.780> ragtime

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
start to learn a new piece of ragtime

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.499 
start to learn a new piece of ragtime
music<00:06:27.409> or<00:06:28.039> any<00:06:28.280> key<00:06:28.340> card<00:06:28.759> it<00:06:28.909> music<00:06:29.300> that

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
music or any key card it music that

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.469 
music or any key card it music that
needs<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:30.379> to<00:06:30.530> automate<00:06:30.889> the<00:06:31.099> thumb<00:06:31.479> bear

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
needs you to automate the thumb bear

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.689 
needs you to automate the thumb bear
this<00:06:32.659> in<00:06:32.870> mind<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.470> work<00:06:33.949> out<00:06:34.190> how<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.460> can

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
this in mind and work out how you can

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.760 
this in mind and work out how you can
make<00:06:34.759> the<00:06:35.030> for<00:06:35.240> more<00:06:35.449> interesting<00:06:35.870> introduce

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
make the for more interesting introduce

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.920 
make the for more interesting introduce
some<00:06:36.949> syncopation<00:06:37.759> make<00:06:37.970> your<00:06:38.150> thumb<00:06:38.419> dance<00:06:38.750> a

some syncopation make your thumb dance a

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.779 
some syncopation make your thumb dance a
little<00:06:39.050> bit<00:06:39.169> in<00:06:39.830> this<00:06:40.099> way<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:40.340> can<00:06:40.610> raise

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
little bit in this way you can raise

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.360 
little bit in this way you can raise
your<00:06:41.000> music<00:06:41.479> above<00:06:42.169> the<00:06:42.349> average<00:06:42.470> just<00:06:43.159> take

your music above the average just take

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.570 
your music above the average just take
it<00:06:43.400> a<00:06:43.550> little<00:06:43.699> not<00:06:44.300> above<00:06:44.690> and<00:06:45.340> this<00:06:46.340> is<00:06:46.490> the
