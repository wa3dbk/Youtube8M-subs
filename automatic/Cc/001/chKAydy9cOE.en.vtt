what<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.570> up<00:00:00.719> guys<00:00:00.750> when<00:00:01.290> conditions<00:00:01.560> are

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
what is up guys when conditions are

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.010 
what is up guys when conditions are
probably<00:00:02.580> one<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> most<00:00:03.389> important

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
probably one of the most important

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.360 
probably one of the most important
aspects<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.500> climbing<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.859> ladder<00:00:05.100> it's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
aspects of climbing the ladder it's

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.309 
aspects of climbing the ladder it's
really<00:00:05.700> what<00:00:05.910> can<00:00:06.120> separate<00:00:06.720> like<00:00:07.049> two

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
really what can separate like two

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.320 
really what can separate like two
players<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.919> same<00:00:08.160> mechanical<00:00:08.700> skill<00:00:09.030> but

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
players of the same mechanical skill but

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.270 
players of the same mechanical skill but
one<00:00:09.599> will<00:00:09.750> be<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> higher<00:00:10.200> ranking<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.040> put<00:00:11.190> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
one will be a higher ranking to put it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.190 
one will be a higher ranking to put it
sure<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:12.179> how<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> win<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> game<00:00:12.929> like

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
sure it's like how to win a game like

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
sure it's like how to win a game like
going<00:00:13.440> into<00:00:13.590> game<00:00:13.889> with<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> plan<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.120> keep

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
going into game with a plan now I keep

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.420 
going into game with a plan now I keep
saying<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.780> maining<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.320> champion<00:00:16.890> will<00:00:17.160> let

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
saying the maining one champion will let

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
saying the maining one champion will let
you<00:00:17.580> climb<00:00:17.820> quicker<00:00:18.150> right<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
you climb quicker right and it's kind of

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140 
you climb quicker right and it's kind of
part<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.470> why<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.550> side<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:21.060> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
part of why there is one side where you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.939 
part of why there is one side where you
learn<00:00:21.330> their<00:00:21.539> damage<00:00:21.960> their<00:00:22.260> combos<00:00:22.710> get

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
learn their damage their combos get

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
learn their damage their combos get
easier<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> mechanical<00:00:24.539> side

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
easier to do like the mechanical side

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
easier to do like the mechanical side
but<00:00:25.109> another<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> learn

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
but another part is this like you learn

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
but another part is this like you learn
how<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> win<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> champion<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
how to win with that champion and you

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.140 
how to win with that champion and you
learn<00:00:28.740> specifically<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> need<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> do

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
learn specifically what you need to do

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
learn specifically what you need to do
at<00:00:30.420> different<00:00:30.630> stages<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.590> game<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.009> win

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
at different stages of the game to win

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.610 
at different stages of the game to win
so<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.210> Shaco<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.989> Shaco

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so if you think about Shaco up Shaco

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.319 
so if you think about Shaco up Shaco
however<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> want<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> say<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> he's<00:00:36.059> always<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
however you want to say it he's always a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
however you want to say it he's always a
pain<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> deal<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:37.770> has

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
pain to deal with right because he has

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
pain to deal with right because he has
this<00:00:38.070> set<00:00:38.370> early<00:00:38.700> game<00:00:38.879> plan<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.809> he's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this set early game plan you know he's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
this set early game plan you know he's
probably<00:00:40.110> gonna<00:00:40.379> invade<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> he's<00:00:41.280> already

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
probably gonna invade you he's already

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.190 
probably gonna invade you he's already
got<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.940> idea<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.420> his<00:00:42.480> head<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.079> he's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
got that idea in his head of what he's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
got that idea in his head of what he's
gonna<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.980> why<00:00:44.280> he's<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> dangerous

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
gonna do that's why he's so dangerous

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
gonna do that's why he's so dangerous
he's<00:00:45.480> already<00:00:45.960> thought<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.800> needs

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
he's already thought about what he needs

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
he's already thought about what he needs
to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.700> ahead<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.149> has<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> specific

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to do to get ahead and has a specific

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
to do to get ahead and has a specific
idea<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.620> focus<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.280> he<00:00:50.340> goes<00:00:50.520> into<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> game

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
idea or focus when he goes into the game

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.389 
idea or focus when he goes into the game
now<00:00:51.660> wind<00:00:51.870> conditions<00:00:52.350> isn't<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.949> specific

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
now wind conditions isn't just specific

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.040 
now wind conditions isn't just specific
to<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.610> champion<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to your champion you can actually use it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
to your champion you can actually use it
for<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> entire<00:00:55.530> team<00:00:55.860> comp<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
for the entire team comp and that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
for the entire team comp and that's
ideally<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> would<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
ideally what you would do and this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.619 
ideally what you would do and this
process<00:00:58.890> we'll<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.879> LCS<00:01:00.329> teams

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
process we'll look at is what LCS teams

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
process we'll look at is what LCS teams
basically<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> new<00:01:02.039> comp

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
basically do when they make a new comp

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
basically do when they make a new comp
they<00:01:02.789> figure<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.390> their<00:01:03.600> strengths<00:01:03.989> are

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they figure out what their strengths are

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
they figure out what their strengths are
when<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> game<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.129> spike<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.909> their

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
when in the game they spike what their

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
when in the game they spike what their
comp<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> good<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> need<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
comp is good at and what they need to do

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
comp is good at and what they need to do
to<00:01:07.920> win<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> game<00:01:08.610> best<00:01:09.000> example<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to win the game best example of this is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
to win the game best example of this is
actually<00:01:10.500> Corki<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.189> especially<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
actually Corki and especially with the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
actually Corki and especially with the
Korean<00:01:12.420> teams<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> watched<00:01:13.380> IEM<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
Korean teams if you watched IEM you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
Korean teams if you watched IEM you
would<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> seen<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.060> every<00:01:15.750> time<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
would have seen this a lot every time a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
would have seen this a lot every time a
Korean<00:01:16.380> team<00:01:16.560> picked<00:01:16.860> Corki<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.939> play

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Korean team picked Corki so they play

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.760 
Korean team picked Corki so they play
pretty<00:01:18.330> passive<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> game

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
pretty passive at the start of the game

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
pretty passive at the start of the game
they<00:01:20.040> tend<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.520> farm<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.270> soon<00:01:21.450> as

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
they tend to just farm and as soon as

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
they tend to just farm and as soon as
Corki<00:01:21.990> gets<00:01:22.200> his<00:01:22.350> Triforce<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.310> group

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Corki gets his Triforce they would group

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
Corki gets his Triforce they would group

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
they'd fight and push down towers

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
they'd fight and push down towers
because<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.220> their<00:01:26.400> team<00:01:26.580> comps

much or just to have a reference to go
back<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.180> game<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> did<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> main

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
back to in game so when I did the main

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
back to in game so when I did the main

in the champion video I did a template

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of gave you an idea of what you should

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
of gave you an idea of what you should
be<00:01:52.770> doing<00:01:52.860> properly<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.939> take

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
be doing properly that you could take

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.880 
be doing properly that you could take
into<00:01:54.360> yourself<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.200> done<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> same<00:01:55.649> here

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
into yourself so done the same here

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.230 
into yourself so done the same here
we're<00:01:56.070> looking<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.430> three<00:01:56.729> different<00:01:57.030> stages

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
we're looking at three different stages

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
we're looking at three different stages
of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> easiest<00:01:59.100> way

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of the game and this is the easiest way

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.370 
of the game and this is the easiest way
to<00:01:59.340> break<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.790> wing<00:02:00.149> conditions<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
to break your wing conditions down so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.170 
to break your wing conditions down so
early<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.979> refers<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.729> lane<00:02:02.939> phase

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
early really refers to the lane phase

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
early really refers to the lane phase
basically<00:02:03.509> mid<00:02:03.960> game<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.439> gonna<00:02:04.619> refer<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
basically mid game is gonna refer to the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.580 
basically mid game is gonna refer to the
end<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> lane<00:02:06.090> phase<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.079> start<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
end of the lane phase and the start of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
end of the lane phase and the start of
when<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> grouping<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> late<00:02:08.759> game<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> going

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
when you grouping and late game is going

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.059 
when you grouping and late game is going
to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.420> grouping<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> objectives<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.920> like

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
to be grouping and objectives so like

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
to be grouping and objectives so like
team<00:02:11.310> fires<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.180> other<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
team fires the other thing that I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.280 
team fires the other thing that I
haven't

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
haven't

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.809 
haven't
mentioned<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.829> is<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.129> about<00:02:14.219> doing<00:02:14.519> this

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
mentioned that is good about doing this

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.369 
mentioned that is good about doing this
is<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:15.629> helps<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.989> when<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.230> get

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
is it really helps you when you get

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.170 
is it really helps you when you get
behind<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.280> know<00:02:17.519> your<00:02:17.700> limits<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
behind because you know your limits and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.729 
behind because you know your limits and
you<00:02:18.239> know<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.629> your<00:02:18.750> focus<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
you know what your focus is and how you

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.039 
you know what your focus is and how you
want<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.250> win<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.819> have<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> specific<00:02:21.659> idea

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
want to win so you have a specific idea

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.690 
want to win so you have a specific idea
of<00:02:22.079> what<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.650> actually<00:02:22.829> do<00:02:23.189> when<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.519> get

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
of what you can actually do when you get

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
of what you can actually do when you get
behind<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.329> you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.510> still<00:02:24.810> win<00:02:24.989> those<00:02:25.170> games

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
behind and you can still win those games

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.110 
behind and you can still win those games
okay<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.219> we're<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.579> go<00:02:26.670> over<00:02:26.700> two

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
okay so we're going to go over two

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.759 
okay so we're going to go over two
champions<00:02:27.629> from<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.900> top<00:02:28.170> lane<00:02:28.349> I'm<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.709> to

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
champions from the top lane I'm going to

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.289 
champions from the top lane I'm going to
go<00:02:28.859> over<00:02:28.980> two<00:02:29.159> champions<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.000> mid<00:02:30.150> lane

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
go over two champions from the mid lane

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.270 
go over two champions from the mid lane
as<00:02:30.569> well<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.170> these<00:02:31.470> two<00:02:31.620> champions<00:02:32.129> are

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
as well and these two champions are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.979 
as well and these two champions are
completely<00:02:33.000> different<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.599> their<00:02:33.810> wing

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
completely different in their wing

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.720 
completely different in their wing
condition<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.189> of<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.579> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
condition so you can kind of see the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.000 
condition so you can kind of see the
contrast<00:02:36.269> between<00:02:36.450> champions<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.799> right<00:02:37.920> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
contrast between champions all right so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.890 
contrast between champions all right so

let's start off with hecarim and early
you<00:02:40.019> want<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> harass<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.889> want<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> try

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
guard TP to start fire so that's a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.979 
guard TP to start fire so that's a
really<00:03:11.430> cool<00:03:11.760> thing<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> hecarim<00:03:12.480> does<00:03:12.780> is

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
really cool thing the hecarim does is

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.020 
really cool thing the hecarim does is
because<00:03:13.290> he's<00:03:13.439> so<00:03:13.470> fast<00:03:13.680> he<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.400> TP<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.909> the

there's<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.400> much<00:03:17.549> they<00:03:17.729> can<00:03:17.909> do<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.269> stop<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
there's not much they can do to stop it

there's not much they can do to stop it
the<00:03:19.169> final<00:03:19.500> thing<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.739> what<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:20.519> when

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699

reason I picked him is because you have
a<00:03:55.379> choice<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.250> mid<00:03:56.430> game<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.790> either

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
a choice here in the mid game you either

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.729 
a choice here in the mid game you either
built<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.479> split<00:03:57.750> push<00:03:57.989> or<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.349> built<00:03:58.590> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
built a split push or you built a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.649 
built a split push or you built a
teamfight<00:03:58.979> so<00:03:59.639> if<00:03:59.729> you<00:03:59.819> want<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> teamfight<00:04:00.269> you

similar to Katarina you have a good
amount<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.460> damage<00:06:08.639> so<00:06:09.030> you<00:06:09.060> just<00:06:09.270> want<00:06:09.419> to

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
amount of damage so you just want to

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.300 
amount of damage so you just want to
roam<00:06:09.719> and<00:06:09.900> try<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.229> kill<00:06:10.469> people<00:06:10.500> the

you<00:06:13.229> won't<00:06:13.409> be<00:06:13.530> doing<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:13.830> great<00:06:14.190> late-game

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
you won't be doing that great late-game

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.610 
you won't be doing that great late-game
so<00:06:15.150> you<00:06:15.240> want<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:15.479> be<00:06:15.570> snowballing<00:06:16.110> as<00:06:16.229> hard<00:06:16.469> as

so you want to be snowballing as hard as

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.649 
so you want to be snowballing as hard as
possible<00:06:17.099> whereas<00:06:17.400> Katarina<00:06:17.969> can<00:06:18.300> kind<00:06:18.599> of

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
possible whereas Katarina can kind of

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.779 
possible whereas Katarina can kind of
just<00:06:18.900> take<00:06:18.990> it<00:06:19.289> easy<00:06:19.409> and<00:06:19.650> farm<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:20.400> Rome<00:06:20.639> at

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
just take it easy and farm and Rome at

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.370 
just take it easy and farm and Rome at
the<00:06:20.880> same<00:06:21.060> time<00:06:21.389> and<00:06:21.690> she<00:06:21.900> doesn't<00:06:22.050> have<00:06:22.199> to

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
the same time and she doesn't have to

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.649 
the same time and she doesn't have to
worry<00:06:22.650> about<00:06:22.800> snowballing<00:06:23.400> as<00:06:23.610> hard<00:06:23.820> so<00:06:24.509> there

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
worry about snowballing as hard so there

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.240 
worry about snowballing as hard so there
you<00:06:24.750> have<00:06:24.780> it<00:06:24.990> there<00:06:25.139> are<00:06:25.229> four<00:06:25.500> examples<00:06:25.590> and

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
you have it there are four examples and

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.830 
you have it there are four examples and
they're<00:06:26.340> all<00:06:26.460> extremely<00:06:27.180> different<00:06:27.389> like<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
they're all extremely different like the

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.629 
they're all extremely different like the
top<00:06:28.020> laners<00:06:28.349> are<00:06:28.500> completely<00:06:29.130> different<00:06:29.490> play

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
top laners are completely different play

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.070 
top laners are completely different play
styles<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.300> shows<00:06:30.539> you<00:06:30.719> why<00:06:30.870> win

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080

the<00:06:32.940> game<00:06:33.120> are<00:06:33.389> so<00:06:33.570> important<00:06:34.169> because<00:06:34.199> there

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
the game are so important because there

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.230
