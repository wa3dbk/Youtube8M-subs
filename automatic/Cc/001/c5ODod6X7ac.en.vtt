00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.670 
personally while that shadow drill this
video<00:01:01.629> I'm<00:01:02.140> gonna<00:01:02.590> go<00:01:03.300> arm<00:01:04.300> drag<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.870> I'll<00:01:05.410> go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
video I'm gonna go arm drag and I'll go

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.620 
video I'm gonna go arm drag and I'll go
into<00:01:05.979> my<00:01:06.340> high<00:01:06.549> dives<00:01:06.850> even<00:01:07.330> though<00:01:07.420> there's

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
into my high dives even though there's

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.380 
into my high dives even though there's
nobody<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> front<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.530> me<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:10.299> gonna

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
nobody in front of me so we're gonna

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.539 
nobody in front of me so we're gonna
make<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.720> as<00:01:10.840> realistic<00:01:11.560> as<00:01:11.860> possible<00:01:11.920> with

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
make it as realistic as possible with

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.340 
make it as realistic as possible with
our<00:01:12.640> movement<00:01:13.119> just<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:13.900> we<00:01:14.020> wouldn't<00:01:14.229> a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
our movement just like we wouldn't a

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.370 
our movement just like we wouldn't a
match<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.659> might<00:01:16.900> be<00:01:17.020> different

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
match and so you might be different

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
match and so you might be different
whatever<00:01:17.710> technique<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.340> like<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:18.700> do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
practicing it without money in front of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.300 
practicing it without money in front of
you<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.579> really<00:01:21.700> valuable<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.799> again<00:01:24.040> making

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
you is really valuable but again making

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.460 
you is really valuable but again making
it<00:01:24.490> look<00:01:24.700> like<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.909> real<00:01:25.150> match<00:01:25.420> so

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.650 

do<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.460> how<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.670> start<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.090> move<00:01:29.270> around<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
do and how to start to move around the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.860 
do and how to start to move around the
map<00:01:29.870> like<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.590> wrestling<00:01:31.210> visualize<00:01:32.210> maybe

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
map like that wrestling visualize maybe
