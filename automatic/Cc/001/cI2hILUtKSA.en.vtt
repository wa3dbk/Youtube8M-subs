00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.320
 he was far from imagining that the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.760
 real drama would be playing outside 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.760
 boxes and bubbles 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.370
 I am neither clearly discover 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.739
 behind the scenes of creation 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.160
 welcome to last man last 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.350

 it's in the heart of paris in a workshop 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.020
 spacious where many artists 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 work in a studious atmosphere 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.570
 that we find the heights of last 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.570
 man 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.570
 the basin is vast I am author of 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 comics and I'm part of the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 project the video s is to make a big 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 show and action adventure to do the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.230
 best possible story and and so much 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.559
 that we will remain welded can nothing we 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.750
 arrive 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 and actually the mood is good 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.830
 more often and probe pages 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.520
 if they quickly had less 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 regularly 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.790
 for sure it's an unusual project on 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.070
 believe it a lot 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 we invested a max of money it's 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.290
 that's the job the publisher knows how to take 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.799
 risks 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.650
 it's going to work we believe in it to death of any 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.479
 way it works 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 yeah didier yes but I know but we 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 it's been two months, but what is it? 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 you think we are not machines 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.900
 what will be done more and more of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 web pages delighted I understand true 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.060
 I understand 200 pages in three months 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.380
 recalls an account but these people 20 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.119
 pages by this media that the Japanese 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.680
 calais to do that there we are not yet 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 cruising speed so the publisher 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 worry is normal we have the gear on 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.689
 has the talent to what we need we will do 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.950
 the job 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.030
 the words are meant to be reassuring 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 we read on the faces of worry 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.149
 good year badly the work takes over the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.549
 rhythm is better the mood 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.649
 extremely studious yet a 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.270
 certain tension prevails since the coup de 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.189
 editor's thread the water that sleeps and at 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 two drops of overflowing and can 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.620
 turn into a torrent at the slightest 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.720
 skirmish hic on 304 richard is 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 also a bit like that with his hand the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.129
 request to repeat five times the breakage 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.849
 who had fun what frankly I know 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.410
 not what he finds 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.870
 I saw Bastien who took two 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.010
 times three times four times friends 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.330
 after a while you have to let go 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 stop buggers flies what's that 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 no use the album he takes the water and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.380
 training but I do five times everything 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.650
 the cases if their faith passes it goes through 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.970
 a little more forward go ahead do it it's 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.260
 not to me to do it is who finished it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.069
 I was worth it just bad time to do not 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:59.109
 not offer them that's cool I the box 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:02.980
 instead of michael hunter doing it 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.600
 register yes if everyone does what he 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.730
 must do it's good half day I'm 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 was doing a siphon tale and I'm doing 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.319
 my boxes where I need storyboard you have 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.850
 does it less than you see yes yes but if 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.430
 information does not pass 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.260
 the point of no return seems to reach the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.620
 anger is spreading like a trail of 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.840
 powder 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 the team is on the verge of coming 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.590
 in the hands 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.180
 me you came in this adventure between 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.440
 we in the coming year 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.060
 and there must is that because of the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.500
 shit it with shit when you 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.209
 go over all his age group do not 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500
 do not crisis, slow down the version 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:42.050
 doubling same ear 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:45.830
 if it was clear to me, I thought 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.670
 it's fucked we never see it happen 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.510
 that's when I heard 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.510
 talk about miss hitomi 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:10.599
