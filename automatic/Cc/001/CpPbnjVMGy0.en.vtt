00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:19.050
 hi then raju of the how it is 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 called perfectionist airbrush foundation 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.080
 then the airbrush foundation then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 class spray and sephora cost 28 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 dollars and shades are available 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.690
 I think 10 8 10 a good to a good one 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.780
 color range I think it's the first 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.850
 airbrush foundation that I review I believe 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.410
 yes indeed therefore also 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 see the application I think it is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.770
 interesting so now I leave you 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 the application we see immediately after 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.960
 with my impressions let's see what he has 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.960
 combined 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.610
 and this is the application of the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.830
 perfectionist something I don't have 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 done in fact I wanted to remind you in 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.640
 so as not to stain clothes or hair 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 just to cover a shower cap 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.450
 the earpiece that maybe used to do 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 the shower or a robe a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.300
 something precisely that I don't go to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.430
 then dirty clothes underneath 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.410
 I have to say I didn't get dirty though 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.759
 care must therefore be taken 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.740
 in short, to avoid stains better 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.900
 to prevent 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.180
 so what do I think we start right away 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.970
 we start immediately from the application I believe 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 that is really one of the applications 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:15.630
 faster than you can have because 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.549
 splash on the face in a circular manner e 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.430
 at about twenty centimeters and then go to 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:26.370
 blend in the areas where you are not 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 been precise or there are little ones 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.750
 accumulations around the nose, eyes you could 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.730
 to say that on the rest of the face it really does 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.180
 a great job in the sense that not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 you must even fade so much and with 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.600
 the brush because it succeeds in 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.240
 really apply the application 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.490
 uniform the final effect on the skin is 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:57.150
 really light and with a matte finish 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.260
 it is an oil free foundation and I have to say 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.850
 I definitely think it's more suitable 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.050
 to a normal to mixed skin 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.710
 grozny normal mixed fat if not 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.010
 I would recommend for a skin for a skin 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.740
 more dry in the period 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.350
 winter not being a product 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:29.580
 however it is not moisturizing and free 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.840
 surely it does not feed the skin 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.300
 does not go to give hydration exploit 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.910
 dry skin and it's all as usual 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.380
 I hope this review has been useful 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.380
 I send a big kiss bye
