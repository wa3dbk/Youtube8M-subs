00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.009
 saha him the geeks and the geekettes these 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.389
 videos was I hope you're fine 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 despite this heat wave I created 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.949
 today the guild on the server 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 hacker that so I'm going to talk to you in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 this video of this guild 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 I did not have time to do 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 today the tutorial for the masses but 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 promised I'll do it tomorrow sure 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.449
 it's just that it's a video that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 takes a little bit of time and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 today I could not but I created 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 the guild so I decided to call it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 phoenix some of you had 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.629
 proposed reborn and I told myself that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.809
 this is phoenix it stays a little bit in 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.129
 the spirit one to dofus 1.29 which was 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.010
 really a very beautiful time for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 dofus then finally it was stopped 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 for dofus 2 but it's true that there 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.180
 had these servers a little bit hidden 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.070
 erat and and cloud on which we will say 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 the historical version made the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.030
 resistance and suddenly that's simple a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.899
 Renaissance 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 so that's why I wanted 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.850
 call the phoenix guide is a small 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.970
 little renaissance 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.420
 the phoenix rising from the ashes 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.420
 as sings cucchi tavus at eurovision 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.549
 so here's the guild is open 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.079
 I decided the coup as I told you 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.880
 to call it phoenix then there are two 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.140
 spelling so it's not a fault 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.030
 of spelling to have it done like this 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.200
 we could have done phoenix36 no ben there 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090
 as I write it would have been better 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 which is absence action and forgiveness 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.920
 but it's not possible for a name of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.229
 guild so I did like that we already have 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.860
 a few people who contacted me and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.329
 we recruited I created on my site 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 end this page already existed but I 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.119
 a little bit modified so that's for the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.069
 guild so for one says there is no 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.229
 for the moment of minimum level every 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.840
 people who contact me I recruit them 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.549
 so I recruit easily but I turn 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.030
 easily also so the qualities that 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.069
 are being nice to be polite towards the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.450
 guide and the other players so that 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.890
 it is important since we are mainly 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.030
 to be I think not bad to make tracks 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.110
 not bad at pvp 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 so when we have a guild it's better 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.459
 here we go for the street 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.660
 credit for respect in the dofus 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.940
 it's better to be polite to the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.109
 other players actually it's inspire 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.670
 always more respect to have a 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.000
 player who is very very good and polite 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.590
 that a player who is very good and rude 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.989
 is even worse a bad player who 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 is badly polished that's really the worst 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.490
 but then there are 6 people there 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.470
 sees that they insult everyone 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.410
 on the server we turn them to the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.610
 guild without hesitation you must also have 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.840
 a spirit of them so what 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.610
 means first wondering what we 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.410
 can do to help the guide 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.600
 rather than thinking every time about 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.030
 begging for kamas or other services 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.520
 without helping others so here's after 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.900
 it is perfectly normal to help one another 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 here is also receiving services 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.190
 and give some but I put that because 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720
 that I know that sometimes there are 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.430
 people who go in guides who is 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.750
 a loved one who, on the other hand, asks 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.520
 all the time services to others 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.170
 so that's it it's true that I do not like 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.250
 too much this state of mind against that me 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.470
 not bother at all a guy who is a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.180
 little bit in his corner who who does 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.340
 his character who does his fights and 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.300
 that's it I do not mind but not con 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.140
 really someone who is all the time 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.340
 there to always ask others and him 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.790
 does not help anyone it's true it's 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.740
 I do not like this state of mind 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.270
 so here for the moment makes them 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.380
 so I'll fix it in the days 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.360
 who come for now I put 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.380
 all who have arrived apprentices 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 so they can invite new 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.460
 members and manage their distribution of xp 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.690
 I will add the following video 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.890
 will add the names of the people who are 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.050
 currently in the guide like this if 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.670
 I'm not connected you can 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.230
 contact them is like that and you 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.360
 will recruit because for the moment everything 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.730
 the world can recruit and of course I 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.910
 also looking for right arms so if 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.500
 you have already managed a guild 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.300
 and you want to become a right-hand man 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.490
 for the phoenix guild do not hesitate to 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.250
 contact me and therefore contact @ video was 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.870
 this point as I prefer people here 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.310
 who have already run guilds or who have 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.920
 already been right arm in geeks because 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 that it takes time 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.560
 I have the guide the recruitments manage the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.750
 rights 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.280
 and then after good for now the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.430
 guide and brand new but after 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.459
 a few weeks will be there of course 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.340
 the dramas inherent in group life 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.660
 between human what so what they 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.160
 get along well what they get along with 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.920
 not those who want to stay those who 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.150
 want to leave and all that so here I am 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.440
 know that it takes a lot of time already 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.360
 a guild so if some of you 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.730
 want to become right arm and help me 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.020
 do not hesitate to send me an email 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.630
 on contact 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 @ video was this dot com so here's the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.970
 beginning of a new adventure 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.710
 so here I am really that makes me 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.540
 pleasure I think I think it's okay 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.830
 to be something something quite 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.880
 cool to go back on 1.29 of course voice 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.040
 it will take me a little bit of courage 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.990
 for for the phase of xp the characters but 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.580
 as soon as they are level 60-70 it will be 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.150
 tracks and there it will be it will 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.170
 truly pure pleasure of pure happiness 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.990
 so I put you all the links in 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.390
 the descriptions 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.570
 the links for the guille the links for 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.390
 tutorials to play tomorrow erat 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.760
 I improve the tutorial to play 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.980
 and spleen with and to mass and here I 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.350
 think there is nothing else to 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.400
 say for now if if you come 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.690
 in the guide I think we'll have 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.430
 maybe a preference for the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.990
 majority of people are brakmar nothing 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.540
 for tracking 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.370
 after that it does not matter if if we have who 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.140
 want to be from bonta did not 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:37.940
 really a worry what and and here it is 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:43.440
 is really insisting on the trick of 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:45.810
 stay polite and from and to be and mind 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.370
 of them because 1.29 and this 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.350
 waiter and miss it's really a 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.030
 waiter with a good atmosphere it's 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.640
 really finally me it reminds me 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.720
 really the beginnings of dofus so here are the 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.190
 friends I hope this little video 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.270
 you enjoyed it even though it was just the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.130
 creation of the guild did not have 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.780
 a lot of action but in any case 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.450
