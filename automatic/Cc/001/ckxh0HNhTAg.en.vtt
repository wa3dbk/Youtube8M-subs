a<00:02:48.920> pain<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.400> work<00:02:49.580> around<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.660> worms<00:02:51.140> will<00:02:51.290> go

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
a pain to work around the worms will go

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.280 
a pain to work around the worms will go
ahead<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.830> compost<00:02:52.340> their<00:02:52.700> their<00:02:53.330> larvae<00:02:54.140> and

ahead and compost their their larvae and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.050 
ahead and compost their their larvae and
eggs<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.830> it's<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.430> end<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.819> world

these<00:02:56.750> are<00:02:56.930> worms<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.290> worms<00:02:57.680> listen<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.580> me

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
these are worms it worms listen to me

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.430 
these are worms it worms listen to me
these<00:02:58.940> are<00:02:59.150> leaves<00:02:59.450> out<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.810> my<00:02:59.870> backyard

these are leaves out of my backyard

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.050 
these are leaves out of my backyard
you'll<00:03:01.069> see<00:03:01.280> I've<00:03:01.400> got<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.610> good<00:03:01.790> number<00:03:01.940> of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you'll see I've got a good number of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
you'll see I've got a good number of
pine<00:03:02.330> trees<00:03:02.360> around<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.530> take<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.920> leaves

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
pine trees around so you take the leaves

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.370 
pine trees around so you take the leaves
soak<00:03:04.819> them<00:03:05.000> good<00:03:05.209> it's<00:03:05.750> best<00:03:06.049> if<00:03:06.200> they're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
soak them good it's best if they're

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.259 
soak them good it's best if they're
broken<00:03:06.709> down<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.400> more<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.730> merrier<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.209> the

broken down the more the merrier and the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.509 
broken down the more the merrier and the

further further their composted before

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.830 
further further their composted before
you<00:03:10.610> feed<00:03:10.760> them<00:03:10.849> to<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:10.970> worms<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.420> faster

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
you feed them to the worms the faster

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.870 
you feed them to the worms the faster
the<00:03:11.959> process<00:03:12.410> will<00:03:12.560> go<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.370> worms<00:03:13.700> will

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
the process will go but the worms will

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.339 
the process will go but the worms will
take<00:03:14.030> care<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.510> they<00:03:14.660> will<00:03:14.690> speed<00:03:15.170> this

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
take care of it they will speed this

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.099 
take care of it they will speed this
process<00:03:15.620> up<00:03:16.359> here<00:03:17.359> I'm<00:03:17.450> starting<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> put<00:03:18.019> the

that isn't quite decomposed in the one
worm<00:03:31.489> bit<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:32.810> we're<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.049> add<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
worm bit then we're going to add the

worm bit then we're going to add the
worms<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.890> I've<00:03:34.370> put<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.850> about<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> cup<00:03:35.510> of

worms and and compost from their bin

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.030 
worms and and compost from their bin
it's<00:03:41.870> not<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.109> critical<00:03:42.560> how<00:03:42.650> much<00:03:42.799> goes

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
it's not really critical how much goes

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.080 
it's not really critical how much goes
in<00:03:43.220> because<00:03:43.400> they're<00:03:43.549> going<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.730> multiply

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
in because they're going to multiply

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.930 
in because they're going to multiply
like<00:03:44.329> crazy<00:03:44.389> now<00:03:45.200> let's<00:03:46.160> take<00:03:46.400> those<00:03:46.609> worms

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
like crazy now let's take those worms

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.460 
like crazy now let's take those worms
and<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.389> food<00:03:47.660> we're<00:03:47.840> going<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.019> cover<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and the food we're going to cover it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.280 
and the food we're going to cover it
with<00:03:48.560> leaves<00:03:49.600> here<00:03:50.600> we<00:03:50.690> are<00:03:50.810> soaking<00:03:51.079> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
with leaves here we are soaking the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.009 
with leaves here we are soaking the
leaves<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.769> bit<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.220> bucket<00:03:52.609> water<00:03:53.019> get

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
leaves in a bit in a bucket water get

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.349 
leaves in a bit in a bucket water get
those<00:03:54.260> all<00:03:54.470> spread<00:03:54.889> out<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.280> there<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.700> then

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
those all spread out in there and then

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.750 
those all spread out in there and then
again<00:03:57.139> cover<00:03:57.680> these<00:03:57.950> with<00:03:58.250> what<00:03:58.579> we're<00:03:58.670> going

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
again cover these with what we're going

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.879 
again cover these with what we're going
to<00:03:58.850> call<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.209> bedding<00:03:59.660> which<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> top

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
to call the bedding which is the top

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.300 
to call the bedding which is the top
layer<00:04:01.600> moist<00:04:02.600> paper<00:04:03.139> newspaper<00:04:03.620> or<00:04:04.069> whatever

layer moist paper newspaper or whatever

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.550 
layer moist paper newspaper or whatever
we're<00:04:04.489> going<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.670> leave<00:04:05.120> on<00:04:05.329> top<00:04:05.600> it'll<00:04:06.410> keep

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
we're going to leave on top it'll keep

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.590 
we're going to leave on top it'll keep
it<00:04:06.680> moist<00:04:06.980> it'll<00:04:07.370> keep<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.700> flies<00:04:07.970> out<00:04:08.299> and

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
it moist it'll keep the flies out and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.390 
it moist it'll keep the flies out and
eventually<00:04:08.810> it'll<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.560> composted<00:04:10.220> by<00:04:10.340> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
eventually it'll be composted by the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.150 
eventually it'll be composted by the
worms<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:11.359> there's<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.600> bed<00:04:11.840> pretty<00:04:12.709> much<00:04:12.889> ready

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
worms so there's a bed pretty much ready

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.970 
worms so there's a bed pretty much ready
to<00:04:13.220> go<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:14.239> then<00:04:15.230> we're<00:04:15.350> going<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.530> cover<00:04:15.799> it

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
to go and then we're going to cover it

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.279 
to go and then we're going to cover it
with<00:04:16.789> a<00:04:16.850> layer<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.209> newspaper<00:04:17.750> or<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.200> this

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
few months you can see the water that's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.490 
few months you can see the water that's
left<00:04:33.150> over<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.480> going<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.690> drain<00:04:33.930> into<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.230> lid

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
left over is going to drain into the lid

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.410 
left over is going to drain into the lid
here<00:04:34.830> if<00:04:34.950> you've<00:04:35.640> got<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.880> lot<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.150> water
