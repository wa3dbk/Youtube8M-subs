lot of good components that we're riding

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.610 
lot of good components that we're riding
out<00:02:19.150> there<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.930> amazing<00:02:20.530> how

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
personally for a racer who has the money

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.500 
personally for a racer who has the money
and<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.710> spend<00:02:33.130> upwards<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.700> five<00:02:33.940> six<00:02:34.330> or

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
seven thousand dollars so on that range

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.900 
seven thousand dollars so on that range
yeah<00:02:37.090> absolutely<00:02:37.770> that's<00:02:38.770> we<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.670> handle

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
yeah absolutely that's we can handle

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520 
yeah absolutely that's we can handle
it's<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.270> great<00:02:40.450> bike<00:02:40.660> well<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.350> said

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
it's a great bike well like you said

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's a great bike well like you said
they<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.310> think<00:02:42.370> three

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
they have this and I think three

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.980 
they have this and I think three
different<00:02:42.790> levels<00:02:43.240> all<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> way<00:02:43.660> down<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
different levels all the way down the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.930 
different levels all the way down the
hole<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> frame<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> could<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.820> this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
hole in the frame so you could get this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.880 
hole in the frame so you could get this
for<00:02:46.090> consider<00:02:46.450> less<00:02:46.690> money<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.200> think<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
for consider less money I think the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.390 
for consider less money I think the
common<00:02:48.280> denominators<00:02:49.020> were<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.680> power

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
common denominators were you know power

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
common denominators were you know power
transfers<00:02:52.090> pedals<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.140> well<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.510> know<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
transfers pedals so well you know the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.060 
transfers pedals so well you know the
stiff<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.870> capable<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.739> felt<00:02:59.980> this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
stiff it's capable I felt this

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.250 
stiff it's capable I felt this
suspension<00:03:00.850> was<00:03:01.090> good<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.270> small<00:03:01.660> bumps<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
suspension was good on small bumps and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.710 
suspension was good on small bumps and
the<00:03:02.470> bigger<00:03:03.190> bumps<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.760> had<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.180> our<00:03:04.209> XC

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the bigger bumps that we had on our XC

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.470 
the bigger bumps that we had on our XC
loop<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.040> fast<00:03:06.370> light<00:03:06.730> an<00:03:06.850> efficient<00:03:07.270> bike

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
loop it's a fast light an efficient bike

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680 
loop it's a fast light an efficient bike
that<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:09.430> really<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.150> think<00:03:10.450> at

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that you know it really is I think at

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.400 
that you know it really is I think at
the<00:03:10.750> top<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.440> cross<00:03:12.160> country<00:03:12.370> category

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the top of the cross country category

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.620 
the top of the cross country category
for<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.620> purebred<00:03:15.190> cross<00:03:15.790> country<00:03:16.000> bike

the<00:03:17.560> day<00:03:17.709> after<00:03:17.860> shooting<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.400> video<00:03:18.670> review
