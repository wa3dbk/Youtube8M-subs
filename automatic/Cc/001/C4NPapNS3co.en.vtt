a bit tough but Marvin the beauty about
him<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> it'll<00:01:46.590> only<00:01:46.799> ever<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.579> question

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
him is it'll only ever be one question

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
him is it'll only ever be one question
because<00:01:48.840> even<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.950> takes<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.399> his

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because even more that takes up his

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.929 
because even more that takes up his
allotted<00:01:50.909> amount<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.850> know

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
allotted amount of time so i don't know

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
allotted amount of time so i don't know
if<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.119> saw<00:01:54.360> last<00:01:54.720> season<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.350> actually

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
