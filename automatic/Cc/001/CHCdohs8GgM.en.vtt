00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and then gang beauty that you are talking to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.850
 pat welcome to one more 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 personal video on the video I wanted to show 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 a fucking deal for you is more 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.639
 an indication is so that you can 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 play too 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.590
 but we will talk about this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 subject helm want the last thing 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 evolution of a website controls if not me 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 Duck is Dylan's mistake. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.789
 he created a kind of tool one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.609
 which you can follow the evolution of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 joystick of video game controls is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.880
 of the most known, at least not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 so, for example, it 's the most 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 awesome because you see the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 common difference but here is different 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 but the fighter a are those of nintendo is but 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 also has xbox then has since the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 first xbox is the first and same xbox 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 so xbox 360 xbox wii nintendo 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.660
 playstation playstation 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 very good old because that 's 21 in the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.430
 shop or the funny 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 so I have got the playstation 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 playstation nintendo and xbox is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.440
 It is funny to realize that apparently the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 sony 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 she really believes in the design of the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.130
 control her mano control the play 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.500
 does not change anything from the second 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 playstation 1 to playstation 4 years 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.970
 the analog together there is is a position 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 that you can get your thumbs is 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.670
 triangle ball x framed in the same 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.350
 place 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.130
 the square triangle x bahia does not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.750
 It changes neither r1 r2 nor does it change 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.759
 does not change control of the playstation not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.259
 change is scary if you think that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.740
 of playstation is so good not to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.799
 change I like but play lame 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
 years it was done wrong there we have to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.290
 evolution xbox control xbox 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 a change 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 so not gibberish but has changed a lot 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.259
 he was my big is so even that the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.369
 first I never played in that first 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 xbox control 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.579
 it is big one use so y'know in 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 a guitar a stranger I do not know if 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.829
 You had the idea, did not they? 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.259
 for example x byd already in the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.399
 first in the first version of the other 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.799
 xbox control 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.960
 they could have a half- note format that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.610
 such bizarre softens to give it a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 Tidy on the buttons I think it gets better 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.869
 goes another standard sony the analog of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.399
 xbox I like their positioning 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.660
 a left logic a little more 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.810
 up and right a little lower 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.510
 I think it helps the footprint be the fps 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.049
 together with 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.000
 still the tigers on the back triggers 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.269
 apparently they do not change our 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.189
 but the evolution of xbox is goofy 360 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.019
 for the year is very little is funny is 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.730
 a system that looks like the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.959
 change geleca so change is very 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.879
 cool I'll leave the links in the subscription 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.599
 so that you can well but really 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.159
 very angry and expensive their transformation 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.010
 the transformation of 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.209
 controls so the xbox gave it changed more 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.819
 that for example in the area you do not 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.519
 Nothing changed the xbox is a good time 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.329
 including analog has improved a lot 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.609
 finally finally have the inter mano the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.959
 of nintendo is awesome what I 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.269
 I do not understand start at the little finger. 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.379
 training is a square control like this. 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.329
 with abbey 27 had only 18 well having 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.159
 point I think she's still in a more 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.500
 the old games too right 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.250
 It's good after the understanding has the super 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.480
 nintendo 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.670
 the super nintendo I think a good 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.690
 control I always liked but he is well 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.389
 simple too 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530
 here comes nintendo 64 and evolution to 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.019
 nintendo 64 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.310
 It's too weird partners are 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.680
 linked what kind of where the guys call 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.040
 the noise turns a trident is on 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 It's bizarre but there until the transformation 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.239
 for the program and exchange what is it 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 a control however you never 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.440
 can fit me because billions by 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.349
 buttons is on, it maintains a standard 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.599
 analog but it changes it puts the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.489
 buttons and nail clip fix 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.769
 here comes the control of one and that 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.930
 The little box is small and if that 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.810
 neither they nor put in check for being 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.530
 one of 11 games is not 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.230
 control is little of the doe and then he 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.720
 turn that tablet from the river netão is the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.489
 contrary to the I think reasonable I do not like 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.650
 that I think I miss button in itanhangá 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.970
 for we see that missing button long 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.790
 fasting time for example those with 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.319
 buttons and on the controls I understand and face 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.419
 that business was good and the bad to use 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.720
 The game that held the camera by the button 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.519
 be horrible then the fuck but it's too much 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.109
 cool I spent hours playing here I 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.760
 I'll leave the links to the registration I 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.289
 I hope you like me too. 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.019
 I found the control you think 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.880
 which evolved more that fell is which 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.710
 It was your favorite control of me. 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.139
 I really like xbox control today 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.330
 year and the control of playstation 4 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.969
 I think between playstation 3 and xbox 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.490
 360 and playstation 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.050
 We are cursed beautiful people but I 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.999
 I would rather it is a matter of habit 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.979
 also in the game that is a long time 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.689
 I want to see you leave the comments 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.360
 Thank you so much for choosing here. 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.360
 a hug from the next Baptist and thanks
