this village is absolutely surreal it's

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.140 
this village is absolutely surreal it's
deserted<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.210> mean<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.479> must<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:34.729> at<00:01:35.729> least<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
deserted I mean there must be at least a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.520 
deserted I mean there must be at least a
couple<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.450> hundred<00:01:36.510> houses<00:01:36.900> along<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
couple of hundred houses along this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
couple of hundred houses along this
street<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> single<00:01:39.119> person<00:01:39.300> living

street and not a single person living
here

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
here

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.820 
here
it's<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.930> feels<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> such<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> waste

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it's just feels like such a waste

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's just feels like such a waste
obviously<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.150> been<00:01:45.180> invested<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
obviously so much has been invested in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.210 
obviously so much has been invested in
creating<00:01:47.009> houses<00:01:47.910> for<00:01:48.060> people<00:01:48.979> making<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
creating houses for people making the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.950 
creating houses for people making the
road<00:01:50.430> putting<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> pylons<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.720> lights

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
road putting in the pylons the lights

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.950 
road putting in the pylons the lights
and<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.400> all<00:01:53.490> deserted<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.330> can't

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and now it's all deserted and it can't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.139 
and now it's all deserted and it can't
be<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.950> old<00:01:56.159> maybe<00:01:56.640> 30<00:01:57.570> years<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:59.430> it's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
be that old maybe 30 years and now it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:13.449 
be that old maybe 30 years and now it's
just<00:02:00.390> left<00:02:00.869> alone<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:02.039> rot<00:02:02.509> it's<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:04.430> sad<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.449 

guess<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:15.680> combination<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.739> factors<00:02:16.980> came

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
guess a combination of factors came

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.550 
guess a combination of factors came
together<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.060> there's<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.959> factory<00:02:19.440> behind

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
together this there's a factory behind

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.310 
together this there's a factory behind
us<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.190> looks<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.450> must<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.110> shut

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
us which looks like it must have shut

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.180 
us which looks like it must have shut
down<00:02:23.239> obviously<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.840> water<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> lake<00:02:25.560> or

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
down obviously the water in the lake or

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.690 
down obviously the water in the lake or
has<00:02:26.730> receded<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.920> no<00:02:29.100> longer<00:02:29.370> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
has receded so there's no longer a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.100 
has receded so there's no longer a
source<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.269> water<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:32.430> desert<00:02:32.820> is

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
source of water the desert is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.970 
source of water the desert is
encroaching<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> village<00:02:34.920> itself<00:02:36.980> we'll

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
encroaching on the village itself we'll

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.750 
encroaching on the village itself we'll
go<00:02:38.180> go<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.299> have<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> look<00:02:39.630> see<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.610> what<00:02:41.610> one

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
go go and have a look see see what one

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:55.470 
go go and have a look see see what one
of<00:02:41.790> them<00:02:41.910> looks<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.270 

Cameron<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.659> you<00:02:56.689> imagine<00:02:56.959> living<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.099> this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
Cameron can you imagine living in this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.830 
Cameron can you imagine living in this
at<00:02:58.459> firstly<00:02:58.849> it's<00:02:58.970> incredibly<00:02:59.510> small

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.910 

everything's<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.019> falling<00:03:03.170> apart<00:03:03.620> as

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
everything's just falling apart as

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.970 
everything's just falling apart as
though<00:03:04.840> he<00:03:05.840> was<00:03:05.959> never<00:03:06.109> really<00:03:06.470> meant<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.769> last

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
though he was never really meant to last

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.750 
though he was never really meant to last
I<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.989> understand<00:03:09.500> why<00:03:09.709> somebody<00:03:10.489> wouldn't

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
I can understand why somebody wouldn't

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.949 
I can understand why somebody wouldn't
really<00:03:10.939> want<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.239> live<00:03:11.480> here<00:03:13.689> it's<00:03:14.689> just<00:03:14.840> such

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
really want to live here it's just such

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.140 
really want to live here it's just such
a<00:03:14.989> shame<00:03:15.319> because<00:03:15.349> obviously<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.640> much<00:03:16.790> effort

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
a shame because obviously so much effort

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.059 
a shame because obviously so much effort
was<00:03:17.239> put<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.810> if<00:03:17.900> they'd<00:03:18.049> just<00:03:18.079> done<00:03:19.010> a

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
was put in and if they'd just done a

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.819 
was put in and if they'd just done a
little<00:03:19.250> bit<00:03:19.459> more<00:03:19.670> perhaps<00:03:20.650> people<00:03:21.650> would

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
little bit more perhaps people would

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.589 
little bit more perhaps people would
have<00:03:21.920> had<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.250> greater<00:03:22.579> desire<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:23.150> stay<00:03:23.359> here

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
have had a greater desire to stay here

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.280 
have had a greater desire to stay here
but<00:03:25.269> they<00:03:26.269> obviously<00:03:26.510> didn't<00:03:26.959> take<00:03:26.989> into

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
but they obviously didn't take into

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.220 
but they obviously didn't take into
account<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.739> needs<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.780> people<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:30.079> were

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
account the needs of people that were

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:40.900 
account the needs of people that were
gonna<00:03:30.889> be<00:03:31.010> working<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.489> living<00:03:31.609> here

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.650 

I<00:03:42.340> think<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.490> village<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.000> perhaps<00:03:44.180> a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
I think the village is perhaps a

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:53.160 
I think the village is perhaps a
metaphor<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:49.690> development<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:52.520> begin<00:03:52.820> with

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
metaphor for development to begin with

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.130 
metaphor for development to begin with
people<00:03:54.170> don't<00:03:54.550> appreciate<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:56.540> resources

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
people don't appreciate the resources

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.950 
people don't appreciate the resources
that<00:03:57.380> are<00:03:57.440> being<00:03:57.560> used<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.480> they<00:03:59.480> think<00:03:59.780> that

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
that are being used and they think that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.150 
that are being used and they think that
they<00:04:00.080> can<00:04:01.750> build<00:04:02.750> stuff<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.440> not<00:04:03.650> really<00:04:03.920> care

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
they can build stuff and not really care

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.510 
they can build stuff and not really care
whether<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.610> lasts<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.800> I<00:04:06.800> think<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.340> as

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
whether it lasts and I think that as

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.610 
whether it lasts and I think that as
that<00:04:08.120> continues<00:04:08.720> people<00:04:09.050> start<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.440> realize

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
that continues people start to realize

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.310 
that continues people start to realize
that<00:04:09.860> this<00:04:10.490> is<00:04:10.760> not<00:04:11.450> sustainable<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.170> not

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
that this is not sustainable and not

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.080 
that this is not sustainable and not
acceptable

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
acceptable

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.610 
acceptable
and<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:15.620> hope<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.930> new<00:04:18.110> town<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.560> we

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
and I hope that the the new town that we

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.120 
and I hope that the the new town that we
visited<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.130> other<00:04:19.250> day<00:04:20.320> will<00:04:21.320> not<00:04:21.500> end<00:04:21.770> up

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
visited the other day will not end up

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.470 
visited the other day will not end up
the<00:04:22.310> same<00:04:22.340> way<00:04:22.670> as<00:04:22.790> this<00:04:22.940> because<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.390> would

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
the same way as this because it would

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:46.170 
the same way as this because it would
just<00:04:23.630> be<00:04:23.780> such<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.260> huge<00:04:24.620> waste

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:55.620 

I<00:04:53.490> think<00:04:54.490> there<00:04:54.669> were<00:04:54.789> probably<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:55.180> number<00:04:55.360> of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
I think there were probably a number of

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.790 
I think there were probably a number of
reasons<00:04:56.250> why<00:04:57.780> people<00:04:58.780> decided<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.500> desert

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
reasons why people decided to desert

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.640 
reasons why people decided to desert
this<00:05:00.039> town<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:02.470> can<00:05:02.620> see<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:04.240> behind<00:05:04.600> me<00:05:04.840> the

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
this town you can see just behind me the

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.939 
this town you can see just behind me the
desert<00:05:06.070> on<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.000> horizon<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:08.320> sand<00:05:08.650> which

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
desert on the horizon and the sand which

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.909 
desert on the horizon and the sand which
is<00:05:09.130> already<00:05:09.750> been<00:05:10.750> sweeping<00:05:11.350> into<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> town

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
is already been sweeping into the town

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.300 
is already been sweeping into the town
and<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.370> encroaching<00:05:12.880> on<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.300> road<00:05:13.479> here

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
and is encroaching on the road here

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.240 
and is encroaching on the road here
there's<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.669> factory<00:05:16.240> which<00:05:17.199> seems<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.160> have

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
there's the factory which seems to have

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.029 
there's the factory which seems to have
closed<00:05:18.520> down<00:05:19.020> which<00:05:20.020> obviously<00:05:20.410> wouldn't<00:05:20.949> be

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
closed down which obviously wouldn't be

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.270 
closed down which obviously wouldn't be
good<00:05:21.190> for<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.490> local<00:05:21.639> jobs<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:23.099> behind<00:05:24.099> this

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
good for the local jobs and behind this

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.700 
good for the local jobs and behind this
sand<00:05:24.550> dune<00:05:24.759> is<00:05:24.940> where<00:05:25.289> they<00:05:26.289> used<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.560> be<00:05:26.680> a

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
sand dune is where they used to be a

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.120 
sand dune is where they used to be a
huge<00:05:27.009> lake<00:05:27.280> which<00:05:27.880> no<00:05:28.599> longer<00:05:28.810> exists<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:30.070> so

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
huge lake which no longer exists and so

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.110 
huge lake which no longer exists and so
I<00:05:30.669> think<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:31.419> combination<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:32.410> those<00:05:32.800> factors

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
I think a combination of those factors

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.170 
I think a combination of those factors
there<00:05:34.120> being<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.389> lack<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.720> water<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.820> desert

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
there being a lack of water the desert

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.510 
there being a lack of water the desert
encroaching<00:05:37.750> on<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.930> town<00:05:38.139> itself<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.889> the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
encroaching on the town itself and the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.839 
encroaching on the town itself and the
factory<00:05:40.030> closing<00:05:40.870> down<00:05:41.250> probably<00:05:42.660> meant<00:05:43.660> that

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
factory closing down probably meant that

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.850 
factory closing down probably meant that
this<00:05:45.849> town<00:05:46.509> had<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> death<00:05:47.080> warrant<00:05:47.259> sign<00:05:47.650> for

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
this town had a death warrant sign for

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.589 
this town had a death warrant sign for
it<00:05:47.919> which<00:05:48.910> is<00:05:50.340> just<00:05:51.340> incredibly<00:05:51.849> sad<00:05:52.120> but<00:05:52.389> so

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
it which is just incredibly sad but so

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.300 
it which is just incredibly sad but so
much<00:05:52.750> effort<00:05:53.080> was<00:05:53.169> put<00:05:53.229> into<00:05:53.440> constructing<00:05:54.250> a

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
much effort was put into constructing a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.450 
much effort was put into constructing a
place<00:05:54.520> in<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:56.080> it's<00:05:56.229> no<00:05:56.380> longer<00:05:56.560> useful<00:05:57.190> to

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
place in and it's no longer useful to

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.400 
place in and it's no longer useful to
anyone

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:49.590 

it's<00:06:00.620> been<00:06:00.800> hovering

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.660
