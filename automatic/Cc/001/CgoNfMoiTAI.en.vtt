I<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.609> know<00:00:17.699> maybe<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.359> years<00:00:18.390> ago<00:00:18.750> he

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I don't know maybe three years ago he

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.920 
I don't know maybe three years ago he

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.689 
was about six feet tall he never grew
and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.410> cut<00:00:22.650> him<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:24.090> he<00:00:24.150> grew<00:00:24.529> so

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
and I cut him down and then he grew so

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
and I cut him down and then he grew so
that's<00:00:26.699> where<00:00:26.939> we're<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> he<00:00:28.230> has<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> bush

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
that's where we're at and he has a bush
or<00:00:29.400> shrub<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.000> growth<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.170> him<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.500> old

hazelnut<00:00:32.250> trees<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.149> this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
hazelnut trees do they they have this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
hazelnut trees do they they have this
tendency<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> shrub<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> bush

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
tendency to be like a shrub or a bush

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.819 
tendency to be like a shrub or a bush
rather<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> tree<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.469> trunk

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
rather than a tree with just one trunk

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.580 
rather than a tree with just one trunk
so<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.760> we're<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> summer<00:00:39.410> now<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

work<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> soil<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:17.750> very<00:01:18.750> simple

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
see better is just start pruning a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.020 
see better is just start pruning a
little<00:01:26.979> bit<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.280> get<00:01:27.399> some<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.759> stuff

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
little bit and get some of this stuff

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.499 
little bit and get some of this stuff
out<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.020> our<00:01:29.229> way<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:31.060> see<00:01:31.119> what's

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
out of our way so we can see what's

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:42.169 
out of our way so we can see what's
going<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.960> at<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> root<00:01:32.409> system<00:01:39.450> there<00:01:40.450> we<00:01:40.600> go

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
going on at the root system there we go

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.910 
going on at the root system there we go
there<00:01:43.179> we<00:01:43.240> go<00:01:43.569> so<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.259> take<00:01:44.530> your<00:01:44.590> rake

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
there we go so you just take your rake

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.499 
there we go so you just take your rake
and<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.219> just<00:01:45.429> work<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.030> soil<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
and you just work that soil in it

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.230 
and you just work that soil in it
couldn't<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.840> easier<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:54.399> prune<00:01:54.670> some<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.090> this

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
couldn't be easier to prune some of this

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.089 
couldn't be easier to prune some of this
sucker<00:01:55.599> what<00:01:55.929> we<00:01:56.049> call<00:01:56.259> suckers<00:01:56.709> ground

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
sucker what we call suckers ground

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.039 
sucker what we call suckers ground
suckers<00:01:57.580> now<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.119> want<00:01:58.479> some<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.840> stuff

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
suckers now you want some of this stuff

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.990 
suckers now you want some of this stuff
to<00:01:59.229> grow<00:01:59.319> but<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.679> don't<00:01:59.860> want<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.369> be<00:02:00.490> too

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
to grow but you don't want it to be too

overall shape of it and if you want to

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.270 
overall shape of it and if you want to
kind<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.769> keep<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.450> pruned<00:02:19.450> up<00:02:19.890> keep<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.160> its

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
kind of keep it pruned up keep it to its

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.740 
kind of keep it pruned up keep it to its
boundaries<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> tendency<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.599> keep

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
boundaries I have a tendency to keep

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
boundaries I have a tendency to keep
things<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.200> their<00:02:23.319> boundaries

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.910

if you the foliage is falling into the
dirt<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:34.120> definitely<00:02:34.750> best<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.430> cut<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
dirt it's definitely best to cut that

for the hazelnuts but this is kind of an

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.380 
for the hazelnuts but this is kind of an
experiment<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.550> uh<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.970> know<00:03:01.060> we'll<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.239> how

experiment and uh you know we'll see how

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.080 
experiment and uh you know we'll see how
long<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.810> takes<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.430> maturity<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
long it takes to get to maturity and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.509 
long it takes to get to maturity and
then<00:03:04.180> when<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> does<00:03:05.019> maybe<00:03:05.290> I'll<00:03:05.530> go<00:03:06.370> out<00:03:06.459> and

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
then when it does maybe I'll go out and

then when it does maybe I'll go out and
purchase<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.970> fully<00:03:07.180> mature<00:03:07.540> easel<00:03:07.870> nut<00:03:07.989> tree
