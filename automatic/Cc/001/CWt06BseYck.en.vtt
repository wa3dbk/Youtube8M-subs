of a neuronal Ahmet I tried the bush ice
a<00:02:08.539> few<00:02:09.110> weeks<00:02:09.410> or<00:02:09.739> months<00:02:10.039> ago<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.819> was<00:02:10.850> a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
a few weeks or months ago and that was a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.630 
a few weeks or months ago and that was a
little<00:02:13.190> bit<00:02:13.430> more<00:02:13.700> strong<00:02:14.209> alcohol<00:02:14.959> flavor

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
little bit more strong alcohol flavor

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:31.140 
little bit more strong alcohol flavor
let's<00:02:16.640> go<00:02:16.880> ahead<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.209> see<00:02:17.360> how<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.780> tastes

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.180 

very<00:02:31.780> smooth<00:02:32.260> taste

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.930 

see<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.210> goes<00:02:37.250> remember<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> bush<00:02:38.610> ice

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
see how it goes remember the bush ice

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.250 
see how it goes remember the bush ice
was<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> lot<00:02:39.840> better<00:02:40.160> right<00:02:41.160> off<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.400> bat<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
was a lot better right off the bat and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:59.000 
was a lot better right off the bat and
then<00:02:43.260> started<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.830> get<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.160> bit<00:02:44.460> bitter

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.759 

you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.640> tell<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.420> stronger<00:03:00.870> alcohol

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
you can tell it's a stronger alcohol

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.380 
you can tell it's a stronger alcohol
from<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.370> flavor<00:03:04.670> but<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.790> doesn't<00:03:06.180> seem

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
from the flavor but it doesn't seem

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.250 
from the flavor but it doesn't seem
quite<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.870> harsh<00:03:07.379> as<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.280> bush<00:03:08.489> ice<00:03:09.079> well<00:03:10.079> I'm

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
quite as harsh as the bush ice well I'm

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.339 
quite as harsh as the bush ice well I'm
after<00:03:10.739> trying<00:03:11.459> several<00:03:11.670> more<00:03:12.360> sips<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.110> is

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
after trying several more sips this is

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.280 
after trying several more sips this is
not<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:15.360> don't<00:03:16.019> find<00:03:16.319> us<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.980> bitter<00:03:18.019> at<00:03:19.019> all

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
not I don't find us to be bitter at all

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.800 
not I don't find us to be bitter at all
like<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.329> bush<00:03:21.329> ice<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:23.810> definitely

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
like the bush ice it's definitely

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.069 
like the bush ice it's definitely
wouldn't<00:03:25.500> confuse<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:27.079> something

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
wouldn't confuse it with a something

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.860 
wouldn't confuse it with a something
like<00:03:28.290> coors<00:03:28.680> light<00:03:29.159> or<00:03:29.430> michelob<00:03:29.970> ultra<00:03:30.269> where

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
definitely note from the aroma and the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.800 
definitely note from the aroma and the
flavor<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> stronger<00:03:40.799> product

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
flavor that this is a stronger product

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.830 
flavor that this is a stronger product
but<00:03:42.810> having<00:03:43.170> said<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.099> primary<00:03:44.849> flavors

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
but having said that the primary flavors

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.949 
but having said that the primary flavors
here<00:03:46.200> are<00:03:46.409> sort<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.159> like<00:03:47.220> Wonder<00:03:47.909> Bread<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
here are sort of like Wonder Bread the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.089 
here are sort of like Wonder Bread the
corn<00:03:50.359> tending<00:03:51.359> towards<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.959> sweeter<00:03:52.290> flavors

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
very minimal hops very minimal

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.990 
very minimal hops very minimal
bitterness<00:03:58.280> which<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> higher<00:04:00.659> alcohol

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000

beer<00:04:03.000> like<00:04:03.419> this<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.459> very<00:04:05.730> positive

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
beer like this is I think very positive

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.770 
beer like this is I think very positive
I<00:04:06.989> think<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.859> if<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.609> one<00:04:09.030> thing<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.449> can't

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
I think that if you one thing I can't

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.949 
I think that if you one thing I can't
find<00:04:10.139> around<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:10.769> even<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.669> Virginia<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:12.569> far

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
find around here even in Virginia so far

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.370 
find around here even in Virginia so far
Schlitz<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.220> regular<00:04:14.760> Schlitz<00:04:15.199> and<00:04:16.199> I<00:04:16.320> think

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
Schlitz the regular Schlitz and I think

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.129 
Schlitz the regular Schlitz and I think
this<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:16.919> this<00:04:17.370> good<00:04:17.699> that<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.419> regular

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
this is this good that the regular

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.039 
this is this good that the regular
Schlitz<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.760> probably<00:04:21.359> going<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.690> be<00:04:21.750> very

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
Schlitz is probably going to be very

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.830 
Schlitz is probably going to be very
good<00:04:22.440> too<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.070> don't<00:04:23.789> think<00:04:24.060> they<00:04:24.210> lost<00:04:24.539> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
good too I don't think they lost the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.589 
good too I don't think they lost the
game<00:04:25.080> because<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.830> their<00:04:26.099> quality<00:04:26.970> or<00:04:27.150> flavor

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
game because of their quality or flavor

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.870 
game because of their quality or flavor
but<00:04:28.310> because<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.340> some<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:31.550> business<00:04:32.550> type

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
but because of some of the business type

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.330 
but because of some of the business type
issues<00:04:33.180> at<00:04:33.720> intervene<00:04:34.199> at<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.800> time<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
issues at intervene at the time so I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.060
