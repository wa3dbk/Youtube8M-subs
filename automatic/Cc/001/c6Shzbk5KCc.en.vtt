all right today I'm doing a video on the

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.940 
all right today I'm doing a video on the
super<00:00:05.580> wild<00:00:05.759> card<00:00:06.120> again<00:00:06.499> had<00:00:07.499> a<00:00:07.529> couple<00:00:07.799> of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
super wild card again had a couple of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.750 
super wild card again had a couple of
requests<00:00:08.430> on<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.770> work<00:00:10.770> the<00:00:11.010> file<00:00:11.220> system

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
requests on how to work the file system

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.910 
requests on how to work the file system
on<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.060> how<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.270> split<00:00:12.930> ROM<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.740> way<00:00:13.860> you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
on it how to split ROM so that way you

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.450 
on it how to split ROM so that way you
can<00:00:14.130> use<00:00:14.310> them<00:00:14.520> when<00:00:15.510> using<00:00:15.720> a<00:00:16.379> floppy<00:00:17.220> drive

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
can use them when using a floppy drive

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.180 
can use them when using a floppy drive
on<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.360> takes<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> side<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.380> I've

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
on that it takes on the side here I've

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.380 
on that it takes on the side here I've
modified<00:00:20.580> mine<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.560> takes<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
modified mine so that way it takes the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
modified mine so that way it takes the
gotek<00:00:24.390> floppy<00:00:24.710> drive<00:00:25.710> emulator<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.880> can

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
gotek floppy drive emulator as you can

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
gotek floppy drive emulator as you can
see<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.270> not<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.650> three<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.770> half<00:00:28.890> inch

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
see it's not a three and a half inch

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.910 
see it's not a three and a half inch
floppy<00:00:29.430> drive<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.880> there<00:00:30.000> anymore<00:00:30.920> mainly

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
floppy drive in there anymore mainly

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
floppy drive in there anymore mainly
because<00:00:32.039> the<00:00:33.000> disks<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.510> somewhat

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
because the disks are somewhat

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
because the disks are somewhat
unreliable<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.220> hard<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.060> come<00:00:36.239> by

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
unreliable and really hard to come by

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.170 
unreliable and really hard to come by
these<00:00:36.450> days<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> basically<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.880> those<00:00:39.030> who

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
these days so basically for those who

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.370 
these days so basically for those who
don't<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> 90s<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.899> game

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
don't know in the 90s this was a game

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.350 
don't know in the 90s this was a game
backup<00:00:43.829> system<00:00:44.220> basically<00:00:44.790> how<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> worked

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
backup system basically how it worked

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.139 
backup system basically how it worked
was<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:46.770> open<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.780> plug<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> game<00:00:49.230> here

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
was you open this up plug in a game here

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.850 
was you open this up plug in a game here
turn<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.260> through<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> file

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
turn it on and then through the file

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
turn it on and then through the file
system<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.700> could<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> game

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
system here you could back up the game

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.580 
system here you could back up the game
and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> didn't<00:00:57.210> need<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and then make it so you didn't need the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.529 
and then make it so you didn't need the
cartridge<00:00:59.010> anymore<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
cartridge anymore so then you would just

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.380 
cartridge anymore so then you would just
run<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> games<00:01:04.040> off<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> floppy<00:01:05.729> disks<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
run the games off of the floppy disks so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.359 
run the games off of the floppy disks so
say<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.140> instance<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.250> floppy<00:01:09.210> disk<00:01:09.540> one

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
say for instance this is floppy disk one

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.560 
say for instance this is floppy disk one
so<00:01:11.930> using<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> menu<00:01:13.350> system<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so using the menu system here you go to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.120 
so using the menu system here you go to
that<00:01:15.890> super<00:01:16.890> wild<00:01:17.070> card<00:01:17.460> play<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> game<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
that super wild card play a game and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
that super wild card play a game and
depending<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.400> disc<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
depending on what disc is in there it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.160 
depending on what disc is in there it
would<00:01:22.110> play<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> game<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.159> selected

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
would play it the game you just selected

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:37.130 
would play it the game you just selected
it<00:01:25.170> would<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> few<00:01:26.100> seconds<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> load<00:01:26.760> up

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 

once<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.920> loaded<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:39.030> put<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.330> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
once it's loaded up you could put it in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.380 
once it's loaded up you could put it in
normal<00:01:40.410> mode<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.770> memory<00:01:41.160> mode<00:01:41.430> memory<00:01:42.060> mode

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
normal mode or memory mode memory mode

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
normal mode or memory mode memory mode
was<00:01:42.630> sort<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.190> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.840> if

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
was sort of a as you can see here if

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
was sort of a as you can see here if
it's<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.200> memory<00:01:46.380> mode<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.980> have<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.190> slow

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's in memory mode you can have a slow

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.540 
it's in memory mode you can have a slow
motion<00:01:47.640> memory<00:01:48.240> game<00:01:48.420> recall<00:01:48.930> game<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.340> then

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
motion memory game recall game and then

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.610 
motion memory game recall game and then
go<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.910> menu<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.840> would<00:01:51.990> allow<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.260> to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
go to the menu this would allow you to

just gonna go normal mode just for

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
just gonna go normal mode just for
demonstration<00:01:59.180> by<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> way<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> never<00:02:00.660> really

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
demonstration by the way I never really

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.930 
demonstration by the way I never really
understood<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.440> fully<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:02.730> could

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
understood it fully and it really could

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.210 
understood it fully and it really could
get<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.300> save<00:02:03.870> feature<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.560> reliable<00:02:05.130> on

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
get the save feature to be reliable on

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.450 
get the save feature to be reliable on
it<00:02:05.400> maybe<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.800> but<00:02:07.800> once<00:02:08.280> it's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it maybe it's just me but once it's

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.960 
it maybe it's just me but once it's
loaded

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
loaded

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.770 
loaded
I<00:02:09.000> mean<00:02:09.780> basically<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:11.630> Super<00:02:12.630> Famicom

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
I mean basically it's Super Famicom

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.220 
I mean basically it's Super Famicom
Super<00:02:13.410> Nintendo<00:02:14.030> running<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> game<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:16.080> as

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
Super Nintendo running the game just as

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.740 
copy it over there
do<00:05:05.210> whatever<00:05:06.370> put<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.490> back<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.449> you<00:05:08.599> could

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
do whatever put it back and you could

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.920 
do whatever put it back and you could
just<00:05:09.099> right<00:05:10.099> click<00:05:10.370> copy<00:05:10.759> so<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.330> way<00:05:11.449> your

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
just right click copy so that way your

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.689 
just right click copy so that way your
roll<00:05:12.110> your<00:05:12.409> ROM<00:05:12.620> folder<00:05:13.009> stays<00:05:13.280> nice<00:05:13.490> and

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
roll your ROM folder stays nice and

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.779 
roll your ROM folder stays nice and
organized<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:14.960> paste<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.440> over<00:05:15.500> there<00:05:15.789> and

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
organized so paste it over there and

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.879 
organized so paste it over there and
then<00:05:16.909> go<00:05:17.060> back<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.449> program<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.139> if<00:05:18.800> you

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
then go back to the program and if you

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.659 
then go back to the program and if you
look<00:05:19.069> right<00:05:19.190> here<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:20.810> says<00:05:21.050> split<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.710> it's

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
look right here this says split and it's

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.730 
look right here this says split and it's
got<00:05:22.849> a<00:05:22.879> capital<00:05:23.330> S<00:05:23.539> that's<00:05:23.900> green<00:05:24.229> doubt<00:05:24.469> so

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
got a capital S that's green doubt so

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.619 
got a capital S that's green doubt so
basically<00:05:25.250> what<00:05:25.490> this<00:05:25.610> means<00:05:25.879> anything<00:05:26.300> you

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
basically what this means anything you

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.589 
basically what this means anything you
see<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:27.020> these<00:05:27.169> menus<00:05:27.669> by<00:05:28.669> hitting<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.270> key

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
see on these menus by hitting the key

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.439 
see on these menus by hitting the key
that's<00:05:30.080> a<00:05:30.469> different<00:05:30.860> color<00:05:31.129> if<00:05:31.909> you<00:05:32.090> hit<00:05:32.300> that

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
that's a different color if you hit that

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.119 
that's a different color if you hit that
key<00:05:32.690> on<00:05:32.719> the<00:05:32.930> keyboard<00:05:33.110> that'll<00:05:33.740> do<00:05:33.919> that

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
key on the keyboard that'll do that

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.490 
key on the keyboard that'll do that
function<00:05:34.669> for<00:05:34.909> this<00:05:35.029> program<00:05:35.479> so<00:05:36.259> in<00:05:36.409> this

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
function for this program so in this

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.550 
function for this program so in this
situation<00:05:36.710> for<00:05:37.310> split<00:05:38.029> s<00:05:38.270> is<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.960> highlighted

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
situation for split s is the highlighted

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.369 
situation for split s is the highlighted
uppercase<00:05:40.370> word<00:05:40.669> or<00:05:41.060> letter<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.750> I'll<00:05:41.990> hit<00:05:42.169> S

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
uppercase word or letter so I'll hit S

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.909 
uppercase word or letter so I'll hit S
and<00:05:42.789> then<00:05:43.789> now<00:05:44.479> it<00:05:44.840> found<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.349> game<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.740> there

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
and then now it found the game in there

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.570 
and then now it found the game in there
so<00:05:46.639> arrow<00:05:46.940> key<00:05:47.210> down<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.990> game<00:05:48.219> hit<00:05:49.219> enter

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
so arrow key down to the game hit enter

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.899 
so arrow key down to the game hit enter
and<00:05:50.199> down<00:05:51.199> here<00:05:51.500> you'll<00:05:51.680> notice<00:05:52.009> that<00:05:52.669> it<00:05:52.879> says

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
and down here you'll notice that it says

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.469 
and down here you'll notice that it says
select<00:05:53.719> split<00:05:54.259> size<00:05:54.529> and<00:05:54.860> n<00:05:55.190> bit<00:05:55.490> right<00:05:56.360> now

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
select split size and n bit right now

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.649 
select split size and n bit right now
it's<00:05:56.659> set<00:05:56.779> at<00:05:56.930> default<00:05:57.110> 0<00:05:57.830> for<00:05:58.279> not<00:05:59.270> exactly

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
sure what the the memory or size

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.790 
sure what the the memory or size
increment<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:05.539> based<00:06:05.960> off<00:06:06.139> of<00:06:06.169> this<00:06:06.469> but<00:06:06.770> I

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
increment is based off of this but I

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.279 
increment is based off of this but I
found<00:06:07.099> that<00:06:07.460> if<00:06:07.789> you<00:06:08.120> want<00:06:08.479> a<00:06:08.539> game<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.900> fit<00:06:09.110> on

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
found that if you want a game to fit on

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.779 
found that if you want a game to fit on
a<00:06:09.319> one<00:06:09.680> point<00:06:09.949> four<00:06:10.250> four<00:06:10.550> megabit<00:06:11.120> disk<00:06:11.659> that

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
a one point four four megabit disk that

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.209 
a one point four four megabit disk that
11<00:06:13.789> is<00:06:14.000> about<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:14.870> max<00:06:15.169> size<00:06:15.469> you<00:06:15.710> can<00:06:15.860> split

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
11 is about the max size you can split

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.610 
11 is about the max size you can split
it<00:06:16.339> too<00:06:16.550> so<00:06:17.449> I<00:06:17.750> put<00:06:18.050> mine<00:06:18.229> at<00:06:18.259> 11<00:06:18.860> hit<00:06:19.849> enter<00:06:20.620> and

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
it too so I put mine at 11 hit enter and

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.399 
it too so I put mine at 11 hit enter and
it<00:06:21.770> says<00:06:21.949> file<00:06:22.279> is<00:06:22.550> splitted<00:06:23.180> make<00:06:23.990> your<00:06:24.169> joke

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.459 
it says file is splitted make your joke
on<00:06:24.589> that<00:06:24.740> whatever<00:06:25.039> but<00:06:26.080> come<00:06:27.080> back<00:06:27.110> up<00:06:27.440> here

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
on that whatever but come back up here

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.589 
on that whatever but come back up here
and<00:06:27.919> you'll<00:06:28.580> notice<00:06:28.759> that<00:06:28.879> you<00:06:29.029> have<00:06:29.150> three

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
and you'll notice that you have three

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.089 
and you'll notice that you have three
new<00:06:29.750> files<00:06:29.990> now<00:06:30.259> underneath<00:06:30.589> your<00:06:30.800> Donkey

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
new files now underneath your Donkey

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.890 
new files now underneath your Donkey
Kong<00:06:31.250> Country<00:06:31.690> each<00:06:32.690> one<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.110> these<00:06:33.289> files<00:06:33.789> is

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
Kong Country each one of these files is

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.480 
Kong Country each one of these files is
basically<00:06:35.900> what<00:06:36.199> you<00:06:36.349> would<00:06:36.500> copy<00:06:36.949> over<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.339> a

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
basically what you would copy over to a

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.610 
basically what you would copy over to a
floppy<00:06:37.879> disk<00:06:38.089> and<00:06:38.270> pretty<00:06:39.169> much<00:06:39.319> from<00:06:39.440> there

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
floppy disk and pretty much from there

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.589 
floppy disk and pretty much from there
you're<00:06:39.770> done<00:06:39.949> just<00:06:40.250> pop<00:06:40.520> the<00:06:40.669> disk<00:06:40.879> into<00:06:41.300> the

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
you're done just pop the disk into the

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.930 
you're done just pop the disk into the
super<00:06:42.500> wild<00:06:42.770> card<00:06:42.979> or<00:06:43.190> magic<00:06:43.460> comm<00:06:43.639> or

super wild card or magic comm or

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
super wild card or magic comm or
whatever<00:06:44.180> you<00:06:44.300> have<00:06:44.509> and<00:06:45.580> it'll<00:06:46.580> play<00:06:46.699> them<00:06:46.969> if

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
whatever you have and it'll play them if

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.050 
whatever you have and it'll play them if
you<00:06:48.050> notice<00:06:48.319> I'll<00:06:48.529> right-click<00:06:48.770> here<00:06:49.339> go<00:06:49.969> to

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
you notice I'll right-click here go to

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.260 
you notice I'll right-click here go to
properties<00:06:50.509> and<00:06:50.750> it<00:06:51.409> comes<00:06:51.620> up<00:06:51.770> as<00:06:52.000> one<00:06:53.000> point

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
properties and it comes up as one point

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.129 
properties and it comes up as one point
three<00:06:53.599> seven

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
three seven

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.279 
three seven
Bites<00:06:54.439> if<00:06:55.009> I<00:06:55.189> went<00:06:55.400> to<00:06:55.580> 12<00:06:56.240> it<00:06:56.990> would<00:06:57.139> actually

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
Bites if I went to 12 it would actually

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.920 
Bites if I went to 12 it would actually
end<00:06:57.650> up<00:06:57.740> about<00:06:58.009> 1.5<00:06:58.909> so<00:06:59.270> that<00:06:59.419> would<00:06:59.539> be<00:06:59.659> more

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
end up about 1.5 so that would be more

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.589 
end up about 1.5 so that would be more
than<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.259> would<00:07:00.409> fit<00:07:00.770> on<00:07:01.009> a<00:07:01.819> floppy<00:07:02.360> drive

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
than that would fit on a floppy drive

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.409 
than that would fit on a floppy drive
our<00:07:02.990> floppy<00:07:03.289> disk<00:07:03.849> so<00:07:04.849> pretty<00:07:05.090> much<00:07:05.210> that's

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
our floppy disk so pretty much that's

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.379 
our floppy disk so pretty much that's
how<00:07:05.539> to<00:07:05.659> get<00:07:05.930> the<00:07:06.770> games<00:07:07.009> onto<00:07:07.310> floppy<00:07:07.819> disks

now<00:07:09.080> if<00:07:09.469> you<00:07:10.009> have<00:07:10.400> a<00:07:11.560> like<00:07:12.560> a<00:07:12.590> gotek<00:07:13.159> floppy

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
now if you have a like a gotek floppy

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.510 
now if you have a like a gotek floppy
drive<00:07:15.590> emulator<00:07:16.219> or<00:07:17.919> any<00:07:18.919> other<00:07:19.189> type<00:07:19.490> of

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 
drive emulator or any other type of

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.790 
drive emulator or any other type of
floppy<00:07:20.120> drive<00:07:20.449> emulator<00:07:20.900> and<00:07:21.229> what<00:07:21.379> I<00:07:21.409> mean<00:07:21.650> by

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
floppy drive emulator and what I mean by

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.439 
floppy drive emulator and what I mean by
that<00:07:21.830> is<00:07:23.529> this<00:07:24.610> instead<00:07:25.610> of<00:07:25.729> a<00:07:25.819> floppy<00:07:26.090> disk

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:26.449 
that is this instead of a floppy disk

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.839 
that is this instead of a floppy disk
drive<00:07:26.810> I<00:07:27.139> have<00:07:27.740> this<00:07:27.949> where<00:07:28.219> you<00:07:28.310> can<00:07:28.460> just<00:07:28.610> put

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
drive I have this where you can just put

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:34.300 
drive I have this where you can just put
in<00:07:28.969> a<00:07:29.180> USB<00:07:29.599> flash<00:07:30.250> drive<00:07:31.250> and<00:07:31.990> you<00:07:33.129> format<00:07:34.129> it<00:07:34.250> a

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
in a USB flash drive and you format it a

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.059 
in a USB flash drive and you format it a
certain<00:07:34.580> way<00:07:34.729> and<00:07:35.000> you<00:07:35.090> can<00:07:35.599> run<00:07:36.500> that<00:07:36.740> as<00:07:36.889> if

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 
certain way and you can run that as if

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.230 
certain way and you can run that as if
it<00:07:37.189> was<00:07:37.840> basically<00:07:38.840> a<00:07:38.960> hundred<00:07:39.139> floppy<00:07:39.529> disks

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
it was basically a hundred floppy disks

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.480 
it was basically a hundred floppy disks
if<00:07:41.240> you<00:07:41.360> have<00:07:41.569> that<00:07:41.979> I'm<00:07:42.979> going<00:07:43.159> to<00:07:43.250> show<00:07:43.430> you
