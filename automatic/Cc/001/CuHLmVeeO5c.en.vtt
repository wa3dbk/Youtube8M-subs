going to want to create an arena let's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.869 
going to want to create an arena let's
call<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> YouTube<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> we've

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
call it YouTube like so and we've

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
call it YouTube like so and we've
successfully<00:00:42.270> created<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.170> set<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
successfully created it and set the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.680 
successfully created it and set the
lobby<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.070> actually

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
lobby there so what we do is actually

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
lobby there so what we do is actually
set<00:00:48.710> four<00:00:49.710> spawns<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:52.399> well<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> players

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
set four spawns for well the players

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.400 
set four spawns for well the players
because<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> has<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:54.989> people<00:00:55.199> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
because you know it has four people in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.959 
because you know it has four people in
so<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:56.879> let's<00:00:57.090> SCV<00:00:57.629> set<00:00:57.930> spawn

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
so first of all let's SCV set spawn

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.890 
so first of all let's SCV set spawn
YouTube<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.460> one<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.570> along<00:01:06.689> here
