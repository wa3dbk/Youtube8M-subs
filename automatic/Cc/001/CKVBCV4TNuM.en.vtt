00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.250
 and his exams welcome 7 of his for 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.230
 learn to open the horizon of the range 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.600
 pentatonic to simply vary the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.220
 pleasures we learned this range 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.810
 pentatonic in first position that 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.740
 means staying in pincers between 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.619
 the fred 5 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.660
 she charters 8 having a good range 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.410
 established that I knew posted there that you 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.840
 know now parker otherwise is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.340
 simply that it ensures there is sleeve 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.960
 of guitar many more places where you 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 find his notes there are reproducible 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.530
 a little higher a bit further down the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.059
 sleeve but it's other ranges 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 facets it's the same range forgiveness 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.360
 I just made a Freudian slip 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.399
 it's the same range 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.719
 but other positions and how to do 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.829
 to learn his positions without that 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.390
 be high barbon possible 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.920
 and we'll do it all 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.449
 gradually by learning a 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.280
 position after another to allow yourself 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.020
 to use everything on the other hand for 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.000
 improvise 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.530
 and what such as a small climb for 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.540
 change range to change 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.520
 position he does not speak well to my 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.570
 advantage 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.400
 this wide or once then I tell you 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.730
 when I get into the range so there 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.830
 hush 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.620
 before the range because I start to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.140
 third brother before the position and that 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.400
 do not want to go home and have everything I 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.730
 just td I would have to go from 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.790
 men in black stuff 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.140
 short summit between the TV 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.130
 we will change position so we 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.130
 starts at third freight 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.110
 there I arrive on my position a 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.240
 so all that to say that instead of 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.870
 start with ton with that fifth 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.120
 cargo as we did up 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.470
 now you will start with your 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.840
 index but at the third freight 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.740
 so you're going to celebrate the first body of a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.430
 third 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.470
 the first as the 5th party we arrive 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.630
 based on our first position 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.840
 Then we go up a rope and we 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.430
 repeat the same pattern 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.270
 Oh 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.760
 and then we'll do that little bit and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.370
 so that's gotten in fresh so much at the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.530
 same position as maybe there is a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.680
 note 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.620
 I so at the fifth freight with your 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.380
 ring of the string carpet when you 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 go slipped of 2 freight 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.410
 so if you tell yourself this slowly 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.920
 make 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.440
 but if you say fast it's actually 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.710
 hitherto so far then 3rd freight with 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.710
 index 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.319
 but here we come from the same 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.939
 position that we learned up 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:54.230
 now so next notes and 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.560
 its normal range that we took up 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.099
 now 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.680
 and here we will redo this weird we 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.609
 said it's so we'll resume since the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.859
 beginning like that we will make a 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.450
 chaining but I stumbled not explained 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.720
 details because you already know them 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.720
 offers 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.050
 it is this test of 9.1 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.790
 so there we came again the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.070
 pentatonic first two positions 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.230
 we are always there pentatonic finds 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.260
 the oven is there so we arrive with 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.600
 the ring finger on box number 9 of your 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.360
 fourth string is the next note on 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.850
 will play the night with the index 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.970
 by no 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.970
 fifth 5th rope but at the 8th party 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.160
 then we will redo my shift of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.010
 two boxes but with the ring finger so 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.620
 on the 9th cargo of the tenth by tenth 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.860
 Party 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.850
 then the last string at the 8th party 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.230
 and the 10th freight 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.820
 I do not think we're going to have a lot of blah 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:13.090
 play it once from the beginning so 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:13.090
 freight rates 3.5 to 7 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.620
 this saddle this r it's a fact with 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.420
 the index the eighth cargo of your fifth 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.750
 rope 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.810
 the 10th Freight Directory 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.760
 one with the index the eighth cargo of ta 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.980
 last chord with alert 10th Corps 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.560
 10th total fred 6th string 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.080
 so there we covered the full range 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:49.270
 she even see me a little bit more and we have 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:51.820
 changed from three positions also do 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.130
 this range going down so I'm 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.000
 reposition on my tenth freight with 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.310
 my ring finger of my sixth string on 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.820
 goes down from freight so with the index 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.940
 8a down the case of a rope 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.289
 freight 10 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.719
 8 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.909
 and with your ring finger this time 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:14.589
 come on the 9th fred de ta 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.719
 fourth rope to prepare you for 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.960
 go down the little slide ndo of our 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.960
 meaning 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.229
 freight centers and we arrive on 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.250
 our position a fifth fee of the 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.250
 gloomy neighborhood with the index 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.940
 how are you doing? I 'm going down one 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.940
 times 10th freeix of your sixth body 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.200
 the 9th fred is a fourth body 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.690
 hey hey 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.690
 e1 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.659
 and here you have learned this little 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.210
 climb is this descent while crossing 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.650
 three pentatonic positions so you're going 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.240
 see that in the next of his will we go 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.220
 to have fun seeing the second position 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.930
 and we learners you will see that we 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.639
 can make jealous transition she gets 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.080
 to please the way of the most 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.659
 great guitarists of the world was going 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.729
 soon one will find everything full 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.750
 info on my site lsa guitar point 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.909
 blogspot.com or dot en it works too 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.650
