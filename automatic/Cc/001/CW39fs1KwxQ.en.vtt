so the boxer s has got a 3.4 liter

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.100 
so the boxer s has got a 3.4 liter
6-cylinder<00:01:41.310> engine<00:01:41.790> which<00:01:41.970> produces<00:01:42.270> 315

fantastic<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> car<00:01:49.410> will<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.920> 30

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
fantastic is this car will get about 30

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.070 
fantastic is this car will get about 30
miles<00:01:50.640> per<00:01:50.850> gallon<00:01:51.120> out<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> highway<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
miles per gallon out on the highway and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.510 
miles per gallon out on the highway and
a<00:01:52.500> couple<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.860> ways<00:01:52.980> that<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.220> were<00:01:53.280> able<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a couple of ways that they were able to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.790 
a couple of ways that they were able to
do<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.360> start<00:01:54.810> soft<00:01:55.050> technology<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
do that it's a start soft technology so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.340 
do that it's a start soft technology so
when<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> stopped<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> car<00:01:56.820> completely<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
when I stopped the car completely the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.450 
when I stopped the car completely the
engine<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:58.950> cut<00:01:59.190> off<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.730> then<00:02:01.370> there<00:02:02.370> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
engine will cut off and then there it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.280 
engine will cut off and then there it
goes<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.540> soon<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.870> lift<00:02:04.050> my<00:02:04.140> foot

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
goes and then as soon as I lift my foot

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.100 
goes and then as soon as I lift my foot
off<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.530> brake<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.910> starts<00:02:06.150> back<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.300> again<00:02:06.480> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
off the brake it starts back up again so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.300 
off the brake it starts back up again so
that<00:02:07.260> really<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.620> does<00:02:07.890> help<00:02:08.040> in<00:02:08.190> your

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that really really does help in your

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.980 
that really really does help in your
fuel<00:02:08.460> consumption<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.750> strange

fuel consumption it's a little strange
at<00:02:10.260> first<00:02:10.290> when<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.800> happens<00:02:11.250> perfect<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.720> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
electromechanical power steering now I
know<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.790> lot<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.000> people<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.420> had<00:02:27.540> some

they're getting a lot of feedback but
we're<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.300> doing<00:02:33.480> around<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:33.930> on

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
we're just kind of doing around here on

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.050 
we're just kind of doing around here on
these<00:02:34.170> roads<00:02:34.380> around<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.709> track<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> does

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
these roads around the track and it does

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
these roads around the track and it does
wait<00:02:36.240> up<00:02:36.390> nicely<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> corners<00:02:37.260> which<00:02:37.410> is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
wait up nicely in the corners which is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.860 
wait up nicely in the corners which is
great<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.240> they've<00:02:39.420> got<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> big<00:02:39.780> hit

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
great I think that they've got a big hit

great I think that they've got a big hit
on<00:02:39.990> their<00:02:40.110> hands<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.560> steering<00:02:41.209> now

of<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:43.980> car<00:02:44.220> down<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.550> under<00:02:45.090> 3,000<00:02:45.750> pounds

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
of this car down to under 3,000 pounds

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.229 
of this car down to under 3,000 pounds
which<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:46.800> amazing<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.820> even

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
which is really really amazing so even

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.460 
which is really really amazing so even
though<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.510> there's<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.750> lot<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.020> improvement

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
though that there's a lot of improvement

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
though that there's a lot of improvement
in<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.739> drivetrain<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> PDK

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
in the drivetrain and the PDK

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.310 
in the drivetrain and the PDK
transmission<00:02:51.180> does<00:02:51.810> weigh<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> little<00:02:52.110> bit

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
transmission does weigh a little bit

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.080 
transmission does weigh a little bit
more<00:02:52.470> they<00:02:52.950> were<00:02:53.010> able<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.370> get<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> weight

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
more they were able to get that weight

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000 
more they were able to get that weight
down<00:02:54.320> because<00:02:55.320> they've<00:02:55.440> used<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.709> lot<00:02:55.890> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
down because they've used a lot of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.199 
down because they've used a lot of
aluminum<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.580> construction<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.090> this

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
aluminum in the construction of this

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.479 
aluminum in the construction of this
body<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:58.050> they've<00:02:58.350> also<00:02:58.620> been<00:02:58.890> able<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.160> keep

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
body but they've also been able to keep

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.090 
body but they've also been able to keep
the<00:02:59.640> chassis<00:03:00.030> about<00:03:00.300> 40<00:03:00.660> percent<00:03:00.810> stiffer<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
the chassis about 40 percent stiffer so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.400 
the chassis about 40 percent stiffer so
what<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.489> means<00:03:02.730> is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
what that means is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.780 
what that means is
you're<00:03:03.710> really<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.190> be<00:03:04.310> able<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.550> really

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
you're really going to be able to really
