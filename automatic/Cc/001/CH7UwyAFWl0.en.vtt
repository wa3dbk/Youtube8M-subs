okay<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.199> today<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.829> take<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> look

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay so today we're going to take a look

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay so today we're going to take a look
at<00:00:02.310> what<00:00:03.149> Vera<00:00:03.419> Vaughn<00:00:03.600> has<00:00:03.840> sent<00:00:04.110> over<00:00:04.370> I'm

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
at what Vera Vaughn has sent over I'm

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.760 
at what Vera Vaughn has sent over I'm
guessing<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.690> new<00:00:07.140> viewfinder<00:00:07.740> for

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
guessing this is a new viewfinder for

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.749 
guessing this is a new viewfinder for
the<00:00:08.040> Canyon<00:00:08.490> 5d<00:00:08.880> mark<00:00:09.090> 3<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:10.410> let's<00:00:10.769> open<00:00:11.219> this

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the Canyon 5d mark 3 so let's open this

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.130 
the Canyon 5d mark 3 so let's open this
up<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:16.430> there<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.420> definitely<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
up and there it is it is definitely the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.939 
up and there it is it is definitely the
multi<00:00:19.560> finder<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.330> should<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.949> fitted

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
multi finder this one should be fitted

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.089 
multi finder this one should be fitted
for<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> Canon<00:00:23.699> 5d<00:00:23.910> Mark<00:00:24.119> 3<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> new

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
for the Canon 5d Mark 3 this is a new

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.759 
for the Canon 5d Mark 3 this is a new
version<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> their<00:00:27.570> multi<00:00:28.019> finder<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.619> it's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
version of their multi finder so it's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
version of their multi finder so it's
it's<00:00:29.039> different<00:00:29.910> quality<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.840> they

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's different quality than what they

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
it's different quality than what they
came<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.859> before<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.850> still

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
came out with before which was still

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
came out with before which was still
really<00:00:33.450> good<00:00:33.570> quality<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.219> what

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
really good quality so let's see what

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.170 
really good quality so let's see what
changes<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.880> made<00:00:37.820> first<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:39.030> they've

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
changes they made first thing they've

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
changes they made first thing they've
included<00:00:39.450> another<00:00:39.840> sling<00:00:40.440> fall<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> focus<00:00:41.070> if

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
included another sling fall of focus if

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
included another sling fall of focus if
you<00:00:41.820> guys<00:00:41.940> haven't<00:00:42.270> seen<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.410> show<00:00:44.309> an

you guys haven't seen this I show an

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.660 
you guys haven't seen this I show an
example<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> blog<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
example of this on the blog this is a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
example of this on the blog this is a
basically<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.120> handle<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.989> attach

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
basically just a handle that can attach

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260 
basically just a handle that can attach
to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> front<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:49.980> lens<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> helps

to the front of your lens kind of helps
you<00:00:51.329> focus<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.840> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.140> easier<00:00:52.640> pretty

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you focus a little bit easier pretty

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
you focus a little bit easier pretty
handy<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> pinch<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.230> check<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> out

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.030 

alright

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.390 

nice<00:01:13.040> packaging<00:01:13.580> nice<00:01:13.970> foam<00:01:16.000> little<00:01:18.400> cloth

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
nice packaging nice foam little cloth

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.469 
nice packaging nice foam little cloth
there<00:01:21.010> some<00:01:22.010> tools<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.610> get<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.760> adjusted<00:01:23.330> for

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
there some tools to get it adjusted for

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.700 
there some tools to get it adjusted for
your<00:01:23.570> camera<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:29.020> don't<00:01:30.020> really<00:01:30.229> see<00:01:30.530> what

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
your camera I don't really see what

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.850 
your camera I don't really see what
model<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.550> designed<00:01:32.000> for<00:01:32.740> but<00:01:33.740> I'm

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
model this is designed for but I'm

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.350 
model this is designed for but I'm
assuming<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.430> for<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.700> 5d<00:01:35.090> mark<00:01:35.300> 3<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> this

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
assuming it's for the 5d mark 3 so this

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.859 
assuming it's for the 5d mark 3 so this
one<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:42.080> baseplate<00:01:43.420> for<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> multi<00:01:44.810> finder

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
one is a baseplate for the multi finder

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.900 
one is a baseplate for the multi finder
this<00:01:47.869> could<00:01:48.140> see<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:52.690> seems<00:01:53.690> Savia<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:55.729> is

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
this could see that seems Savia this is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.190 
this could see that seems Savia this is
really<00:01:56.270> different<00:01:56.450> than<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:56.750> they<00:01:57.050> had

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
really different than what they had

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:08.100 
really different than what they had
before

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.630 

okay<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.130> very<00:02:10.369> different

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
okay so this is this is very different

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.860 
okay so this is this is very different
from<00:02:10.820> their<00:02:11.150> original<00:02:11.860> pro<00:02:12.860> finder<00:02:13.190> before

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.130 

the<00:02:17.870> unique<00:02:18.230> thing<00:02:18.470> about<00:02:18.590> theirs<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.460> it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
the unique thing about theirs is that it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.650 
the unique thing about theirs is that it
it<00:02:21.140> opens<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.590> from<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.920> top<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.580> down<00:02:23.360> here

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it opens up from the top and down here

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.430 
it opens up from the top and down here
is<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> mirror<00:02:24.290> there's<00:02:25.280> some<00:02:26.140> protective<00:02:27.140> film

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
is a mirror there's some protective film

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.660 
is a mirror there's some protective film
on<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.770> right<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:28.070> let's<00:02:28.610> take<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.060> off

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
on it right now let's take this off

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.250 
on it right now let's take this off
so<00:02:31.670> there's<00:02:31.850> two<00:02:32.030> mirrors<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
so there's two mirrors in here so

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.410 
so there's two mirrors in here so
basically<00:02:33.490> if<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.700> look<00:02:34.880> through<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> top<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
basically if you look through the top of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.680 
basically if you look through the top of
your<00:02:35.600> viewfinder<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.240> your<00:02:38.390> LCD

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
your viewfinder you can see your LCD

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.960 
your viewfinder you can see your LCD
screen<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.740> good<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:39.950> low<00:02:40.310> mode<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
screen so it's good for low mode and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.840 
screen so it's good for low mode and
then<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.110> folds<00:02:42.410> back<00:02:42.590> up<00:02:42.830> into<00:02:43.310> a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
then this just folds back up into a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.710 
then this just folds back up into a
regular<00:02:45.040> LCD<00:02:46.040> viewfinder<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.570> whole

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
regular LCD viewfinder and the whole

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.120 
regular LCD viewfinder and the whole
thing<00:02:47.959> attaches<00:02:48.470> through<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.770> quick-release

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
thing attaches through a quick-release

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.750 
thing attaches through a quick-release
baseplate<00:02:50.060> system<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.720> then<00:02:51.650> over<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
baseplate system and then over here you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.370 
baseplate system and then over here you
have<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.090> diopter<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.690> well<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.200> can

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
have the diopter as well so you can

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.940 
have the diopter as well so you can
adjust<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:56.360> lens<00:02:56.600> here<00:02:57.050> for<00:02:57.620> less<00:02:57.770> than

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
adjust the the lens here for less than

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
see that and that's to prevent it from

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.180 
see that and that's to prevent it from
twisting<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.210> an<00:03:56.330> anti<00:03:56.690> twist<00:03:57.190> solution

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190

shift it side side to side so it might

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.830

Zacuto<00:05:14.660> but<00:05:15.560> really<00:05:16.040> good<00:05:16.130> quality<00:05:16.310> the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
Zacuto but really good quality the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.659 
Zacuto but really good quality the
unique<00:05:17.030> thing<00:05:17.270> about<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.810> particular

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
unique thing about this particular

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.310 
unique thing about this particular
viewfinder<00:05:19.669> again<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.150> that<00:05:20.360> if<00:05:20.780> you're<00:05:21.050> doing

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
viewfinder again is that if you're doing

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.980 
viewfinder again is that if you're doing
low<00:05:21.500> mode<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:22.220> could<00:05:22.370> flip<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.760> up<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.900> I

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
low mode you could flip this up and I

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.909 
low mode you could flip this up and I
don't<00:05:24.169> know<00:05:24.230> if<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.350> could<00:05:24.500> see<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.770> but

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
don't know if you could see that but

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.920 
don't know if you could see that but
there's<00:05:25.040> a<00:05:25.100> mirror<00:05:25.460> in<00:05:25.550> here<00:05:25.850> actually<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
there's a mirror in here actually I

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.620 
there's a mirror in here actually I
think<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.350> mirrors<00:05:27.620> down<00:05:27.890> right<00:05:28.100> now<00:05:28.630> there

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
think the mirrors down right now there

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.960 
think the mirrors down right now there
you<00:05:29.720> go<00:05:29.840> there's<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.740> mirror<00:05:31.100> in<00:05:31.130> here<00:05:31.340> that

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
you go there's a mirror in here that

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.040 
you go there's a mirror in here that
allows<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.900> see<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.110> LCD<00:05:33.380> screen

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.400 

and<00:05:36.580> then<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:38.360> just<00:05:38.660> close<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:38.990> back<00:05:39.139> up

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
and then you just close this back up

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.850 
and then you just close this back up
here<00:05:42.410> close<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:42.889> back<00:05:43.009> up<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.910> be<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.060> regular

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
here close it back up to be a regular

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.719 
here close it back up to be a regular
viewfinder<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:47.060> think<00:05:47.270> this<00:05:47.389> comes<00:05:47.599> out

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
viewfinder and I think this comes out

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.999 
viewfinder and I think this comes out
totally<00:05:49.729> if<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.870> wanted<00:05:51.139> to<00:05:51.289> use<00:05:51.440> it<00:05:51.590> just<00:05:51.800> as

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
totally if you wanted to use it just as

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.170 
totally if you wanted to use it just as
a<00:05:52.039> sunshade<00:05:52.690> without<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:53.900> diopter<00:05:54.800> piece

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
a sunshade without this diopter piece

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.119 
a sunshade without this diopter piece
and<00:05:56.180> then<00:05:56.300> again<00:05:56.539> there's<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.810> diopter<00:05:57.139> here<00:05:57.560> to

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
and then again there's a diopter here to

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.129 
and then again there's a diopter here to
adjust<00:05:58.400> for<00:05:58.520> less<00:05:58.699> than<00:05:58.849> perfect<00:05:59.210> vision<00:05:59.419> so

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
adjust for less than perfect vision so

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.390 
adjust for less than perfect vision so
there's<00:06:00.349> a<00:06:00.409> lot<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:00.710> features<00:06:01.009> in<00:06:01.159> the<00:06:01.250> very

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
there's a lot of features in the very

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.960 
there's a lot of features in the very
Vaughn<00:06:01.550> multi<00:06:01.909> finder<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:04.669> know<00:06:04.759> just

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
Vaughn multi finder and you know just

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.119 
Vaughn multi finder and you know just
trying<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.330> out<00:06:05.419> it's<00:06:06.289> a<00:06:06.409> perfect<00:06:06.740> fit<00:06:06.860> for<00:06:06.919> the

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
trying it out it's a perfect fit for the

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.430 
trying it out it's a perfect fit for the
Canon<00:06:07.370> 5d<00:06:07.550> Mark<00:06:07.729> 3<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.930> uses<00:06:09.259> a

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
Canon 5d Mark 3 and it uses a

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.649 
Canon 5d Mark 3 and it uses a
quick-release<00:06:09.860> baseplate<00:06:10.580> system<00:06:10.970> so<00:06:11.569> you

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
quick-release baseplate system so you

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:12.969 
quick-release baseplate system so you
can<00:06:11.750> get<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:11.990> viewfinder<00:06:12.380> on<00:06:12.409> and<00:06:12.710> off<00:06:12.770> very

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
can get the viewfinder on and off very

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.659 
can get the viewfinder on and off very
quickly<00:06:13.130> so<00:06:13.580> that's<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.509> this<00:06:15.440> is<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.830> very

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
quickly so that's it this is the very

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.089 
quickly so that's it this is the very
Vaughn<00:06:16.849> multi<00:06:17.240> finder<00:06:17.599> on<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:18.110> 5d<00:06:18.530> mark<00:06:18.710> 3<00:06:18.770> it

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
Vaughn multi finder on the 5d mark 3 it

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.700 
Vaughn multi finder on the 5d mark 3 it
probably<00:06:19.430> fits<00:06:19.610> other<00:06:20.199> camera<00:06:21.199> models<00:06:21.530> as

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
probably fits other camera models as

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.230 
probably fits other camera models as
well<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.130> you<00:06:22.220> can<00:06:22.250> check<00:06:22.669> all<00:06:22.819> that<00:06:22.940> stuff

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
well and you can check all that stuff

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.300
