00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.080
 editor of the magazines elections that 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.790
 they do not have amazing data and if this 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 We are talking about some things that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 when I looked at these figures I had to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 do well look your eyes I'm still 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 this month is election in the section 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 Green is what the average 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.599
 how many months weeks is delayed 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 disintegrate something that we throw at the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.260
 trash and then they are common things and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 currents like vegetables for example 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.780
 one would think all very fast good are 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 from 5 to 30 days are pretty much like 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.760

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.640
 linger bonilla are two weeks but 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 we continue with things like for example 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.079
 newspaper that would be six weeks 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.489

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.189
 aluminum from 8 to 200 years depending on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.649
 the conditions on how to process a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 plastic bottle we all know it is 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.030
