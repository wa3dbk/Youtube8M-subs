 hello friends that as they are they are 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.190
 welcome to my channel today 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.970
 let's prepare some cookies 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.380
 our will need 500 grams of 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.189
 wheat flour apart I will need 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.050
 another is half tacit to flour 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.060
 a tablespoon ground cinnamon 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 teaspoon vanilla essence a 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 egg 100 grams of chopped walnut 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 300 grams of vegetable shortening 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.400
 a cup of icing sugar 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.550
 a roller 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.190
 cookie cutters and trays 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.730
 where to put the cookies 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 the first step that I'm going to do is 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.430
 put the vegetable shortening here 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.050
 and I will add 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.050
 the icing sugar 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.339
 and I'm going to do it with my hands very 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.890
 clean 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.320
 I will be beating to make a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 kind of cream 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 Here we see how we got a cream 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.220
 Now the next thing I'm going to add is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.220
 to be the egg 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 I will continue to create command 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:38.200
 I'm going to add it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.200
 vanilla, I'll continue to command here 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 Now I'm going to add ground cinnamon 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.800
 and I'm going to keep on beating right now I'm going 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.800
 to add the flour little by little 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.780
 I will still go 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.260
 beating everything 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.019
 I'm going to add a little nut 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.019
 and so I'm going to beat another little 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.879
 I'm going to add more flour 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.170
 more walnut and so on until you finish 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.800
 incorporate everything 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.790
 we had the pot 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.790
 already stuck 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.140
 is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.000
 Now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 to put this some flour here 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.590
 where will I work it 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.410
 I will not put here and I will put 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.390
 another little bit of flour to the rolling 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.390
 that does not stick right now that extends 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.990
 I'm going to take half 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.990
 in the other half I'm going to reserve it 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 now 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.040
 I'm going to extend it 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.280
 I'm going to leave the thickness 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.280
 approximately 2 millimeters 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.190
 so they are not so thick 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 and do not delay in shrinking 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.250
 I've already extended what I'm going to do now 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.710
 is to put him 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.330
 the flour 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.650
 to the tray 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.650
 so they do not stick 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.790
 since I put flour 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.790
 I'm going to make the cuts 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.360
 here we are going to cut 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.240
 a rhombus 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.960
 let's cut a star 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.950
 let's cut 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.950
 a heart 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.870
 let's cut a circle 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.870
 let's cut a flower 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.550
 so we are going to do it until now 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:33.630
 finish trimming the figures 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:36.590
 since we cut them, we are going to remove them 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.590
 the figures 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.980
 and we will be placing 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.980
 in what is subject 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.039
 a tray 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.039
 we can lift with a spatula 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.590
 so we can with hands with hands 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.030
 and we are going to place them what is 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.540
 here on the tray 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.200
 cut and placed the cookies now 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.510
 I'm going to heat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.820
 15 minutes 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.550
 here I already put them in the oven obviously 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.580
 they treated the little one and I'm going to leave them 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.580

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.060

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.060
 balls 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.460
 and this I'm going to put them to bake 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.849
 but I'm going to roll them in sugar 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.610
 glas for 20 minutes and I'll take them out 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.430
 to cool it down well then if you're 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.889
 round ones have already cooled down now I'm going to 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.389

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.319
 the icing sugar and I'm going to place them 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.940
