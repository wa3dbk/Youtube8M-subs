00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
had juicy fruit gum you know that flavor

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.990

of<00:01:54.470> juicy<00:01:54.800> for<00:01:54.980> gum<00:01:55.160> that's<00:01:55.370> not<00:01:55.610> really<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
of juicy for gum that's not really the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.430 
of juicy for gum that's not really the
flavor<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.390> juicy<00:01:56.780> fruit<00:01:56.990> gum<00:01:57.020> that's<00:01:57.350> a

flavor of juicy fruit gum that's a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.680 
flavor of juicy fruit gum that's a
flavor<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.800> jackfruit<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.790> juicy<00:01:59.510> if<00:01:59.570> your

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
flavor of jackfruit that juicy if your

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.350 
flavor of jackfruit that juicy if your
gum<00:01:59.900> tastes<00:02:00.230> like<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.070> original<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.030> one<00:02:02.210> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
gum tastes like the original the one and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.390 
gum tastes like the original the one and
only<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:03.350> one<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.710> things<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.010> like<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.190> do

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
only so one of the things I like to do

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.030 
only so one of the things I like to do
with<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:05.180> juicer<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.720> with<00:02:06.140> juicing<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.830> to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
with the juicer and with juicing is to

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.520 
with the juicer and with juicing is to
juice<00:02:07.400> fruits<00:02:07.720> when<00:02:08.720> they<00:02:08.869> don't<00:02:09.080> taste<00:02:09.350> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
juice fruits when they don't taste so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.500 
juice fruits when they don't taste so
good<00:02:09.890> because<00:02:10.160> juicing<00:02:11.090> will<00:02:11.240> literally

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
good because juicing will literally

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.860 
good because juicing will literally
intensify<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.500> flavor<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.550> fruit

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
intensify the flavor of the fruit

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.240 
intensify the flavor of the fruit
normally<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.110> eat<00:02:15.410> my<00:02:15.650> fruits<00:02:15.980> whole

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
normally I like to eat my fruits whole

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460 
normally I like to eat my fruits whole
or<00:02:16.580> blend<00:02:16.670> them<00:02:17.120> up<00:02:17.300> because<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.050> retain

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
or blend them up because then I retain

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.130 
or blend them up because then I retain
all<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.800> nutritious<00:02:19.430> fiber<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.390> also<00:02:20.600> slows

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
all the nutritious fiber that also slows

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.620 
all the nutritious fiber that also slows
down<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.530> absorption<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.310> sugar<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:23.540> in

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
down the absorption of the sugar but in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.390 
down the absorption of the sugar but in
some<00:02:23.870> cases<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> jack<00:02:24.950> fruits<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.280> are

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
some cases like the jack fruits that are

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.150 
some cases like the jack fruits that are
imported<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.270> not<00:02:26.780> imported<00:02:27.320> at<00:02:27.590> their<00:02:27.830> peak

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
imported and not imported at their peak

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.310 
imported and not imported at their peak
ripeness<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:29.150> really<00:02:29.420> nice<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.660> juice<00:02:30.110> them

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
ripeness it's really nice to juice them

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.630 
ripeness it's really nice to juice them
up<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.770> get<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> nice<00:02:31.400> rich<00:02:32.120> full<00:02:32.570> flavor<00:02:32.870> juice

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
up to get a nice rich full flavor juice

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.120 
up to get a nice rich full flavor juice
so<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.880> was<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.090> cut<00:02:35.330> open<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.130> jackfruit

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
so if I was to cut open this jackfruit

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.000 
so if I was to cut open this jackfruit
here<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.970> basically<00:02:38.150> see<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> nice<00:02:39.200> core<00:02:39.709> kind

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
here you basically see a nice core kind

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.190 
here you basically see a nice core kind
of<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.250> pineapple<00:02:40.910> core<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:41.989> like

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
of like a pineapple core but it's like

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
of like a pineapple core but it's like
where<00:02:42.410> there's<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.650> stem<00:02:43.489> comes<00:02:43.850> down<00:02:44.090> into<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
where there's a stem comes down into the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.170 
where there's a stem comes down into the
fruit<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.230> along<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.040> core<00:02:46.400> are<00:02:46.790> all<00:02:47.030> these

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
fruit and along this core are all these

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.500 
fruit and along this core are all these
little<00:02:47.360> pods<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:48.260> each<00:02:48.800> little<00:02:49.160> pod<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.790> seed

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
little pods in each little pod is a seed

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.479 
little pods in each little pod is a seed
and<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.500> actually<00:02:51.830> eat<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.220> seeds

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and you can actually eat the seeds

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.940 
and you can actually eat the seeds
usually<00:02:52.970> they're<00:02:53.150> boiled<00:02:53.450> or<00:02:53.750> roasted<00:02:53.950> it

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
usually they're boiled or roasted it

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.040 
usually they're boiled or roasted it
kind<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.250> tastes<00:02:55.489> like<00:02:55.550> lentils<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.300> then

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
kind of tastes like lentils and then

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.500 
kind of tastes like lentils and then
also<00:02:57.350> around<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.160> pod<00:02:58.459> will<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.180> fruit

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
also around that pod will be the fruit

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.290 
also around that pod will be the fruit
and<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> little<00:03:00.769> fruit<00:03:01.160> inside<00:03:01.580> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
and this is the little fruit inside the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.390 
and this is the little fruit inside the
jackfruit<00:03:02.630> also<00:03:03.170> contains<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.830> high<00:03:04.040> amount<00:03:04.070> of

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
jackfruit also contains a high amount of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.310 
jackfruit also contains a high amount of
latex<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.239> may<00:03:05.390> want<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.720> basically

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
latex so you may want to basically

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.930 
latex so you may want to basically
literally<00:03:06.620> butter<00:03:06.980> your<00:03:07.250> hands<00:03:07.580> up<00:03:07.730> with

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
literally butter your hands up with

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
literally butter your hands up with
coconut<00:03:08.480> oil<00:03:08.720> or<00:03:08.989> olive<00:03:09.019> oil<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.430> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
coconut oil or olive oil so that you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.340 
coconut oil or olive oil so that you
know<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.910> latex<00:03:11.330> won't<00:03:11.540> stick<00:03:11.870> all<00:03:12.019> over<00:03:12.049> and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
know the latex won't stick all over and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.590 
know the latex won't stick all over and
also<00:03:12.560> butter<00:03:12.830> up<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.040> knives<00:03:13.400> as<00:03:13.760> well<00:03:13.790> but

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
also butter up your knives as well but

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.210 
also butter up your knives as well but
this<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.930> little<00:03:15.080> fruit<00:03:15.440> pod<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.950> seeds

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
this is a little fruit pod the seeds

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.460 
this is a little fruit pod the seeds
inside<00:03:16.670> we've<00:03:17.000> actually<00:03:17.150> already<00:03:18.019> taken<00:03:18.110> out

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
inside we've actually already taken out

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.410 
inside we've actually already taken out
all<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.769> seeds<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:20.150> we're<00:03:20.269> going<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
juiced in this case this jackfruit is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.940 
juiced in this case this jackfruit is
just<00:03:32.180> not<00:03:32.420> super<00:03:32.989> tasty<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.680> I'm<00:03:33.739> going<00:03:33.890> to

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
just not super tasty so I'm going to

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.860 
just not super tasty so I'm going to

one<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.380> best<00:03:39.620> juicers<00:03:40.130> in<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.430> opinion<00:03:40.880> to

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
one of the best juicers in my opinion to

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.720 
one of the best juicers in my opinion to
juice<00:03:41.239> fruits<00:03:41.540> although<00:03:41.810> most<00:03:42.799> fruits<00:03:43.489> are

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
juice fruits although most fruits are

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.270 
juice fruits although most fruits are
not<00:03:44.060> well<00:03:44.420> juiced<00:03:44.870> if<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.709> want<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.040> juice

hard<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.709> firm<00:03:48.980> fruits<00:03:49.400> they're<00:03:50.060> going<00:03:50.269> to

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
hard and firm fruits they're going to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.750 
hard and firm fruits they're going to
tend<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.690> juice<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.110> best<00:03:51.350> soft<00:03:51.980> mushy<00:03:52.340> fruits

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
tend to juice the best soft mushy fruits

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.220 
tend to juice the best soft mushy fruits
are<00:03:53.000> not<00:03:53.030> going<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.480> juice<00:03:53.690> well<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.110> it's

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
are not going to juice well and it's

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.840 
are not going to juice well and it's
going<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.380> make<00:03:54.560> more<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.890> sauce<00:03:55.160> than<00:03:55.820> a

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
going to make more of a sauce than a

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
going to make more of a sauce than a
juice<00:03:56.150> so<00:03:56.360> those<00:03:56.660> guys<00:03:56.930> are<00:03:57.230> better<00:03:57.530> blended

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
juice so those guys are better blended

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.690 
juice so those guys are better blended

not going to work and you can see here
we're<00:04:18.419> already<00:04:18.690> getting<00:04:19.109> some<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.739> pulp

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
we're already getting some of the pulp

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.460 
we're already getting some of the pulp
out<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.639> this<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.850> all<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> fiber<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.720> on<00:04:22.350> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
out and this is all the fiber and on the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.740 
out and this is all the fiber and on the
other<00:04:22.650> side<00:04:22.770> here<00:04:23.430> we're<00:04:23.700> not<00:04:24.000> getting<00:04:24.540> any

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
other side here we're not getting any

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.600 
other side here we're not getting any
juice<00:04:25.080> out<00:04:25.320> yet<00:04:25.500> there<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.130> juice<00:04:26.370> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
juice out yet there it is the juice is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.000 
juice out yet there it is the juice is
finally<00:04:27.000> coming<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.620> dribbling<00:04:28.620> out<00:04:28.740> that's

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
finally coming out dribbling out that's

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.600 
finally coming out dribbling out that's
that's<00:04:29.250> going<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.520> super<00:04:29.940> amazing

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.460 

so<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.910> jackfruit<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.660> pretty<00:04:36.960> much<00:04:37.110> kind<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
so the jackfruit is pretty much kind of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.409 
so the jackfruit is pretty much kind of
like<00:04:37.620> almost<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:38.400> quite<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.850> texture<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> an

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
like almost not quite the texture of an

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.290 
like almost not quite the texture of an
avocado<00:04:39.750> or<00:04:40.440> banana<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:41.639> you<00:04:41.700> know<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.150> not

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
avocado or banana so you know it's not

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.650 
avocado or banana so you know it's not
super<00:04:42.810> juicy<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.440> non<00:04:44.310> juicy<00:04:45.030> fruits<00:04:45.330> don't

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
super juicy so non juicy fruits don't

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.330 
super juicy so non juicy fruits don't
tend<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.960> make<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.200> lot<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.500> juice<00:04:46.830> as<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.190> can

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
tend to make a lot of juice as you can

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.940 
tend to make a lot of juice as you can
see<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:48.300> hardly<00:04:48.840> making<00:04:49.080> any<00:04:49.260> juice<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.830> of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
see it's hardly making any juice one of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.100 
see it's hardly making any juice one of
the<00:04:53.010> things<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.550> like<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.910> do<00:04:54.120> when<00:04:54.630> something's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
the things I like to do when something's

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.750 
the things I like to do when something's
not<00:04:55.169> making<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.680> lot<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:55.979> juice<00:04:56.220> such<00:04:56.460> as<00:04:56.610> the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
not making a lot of juice such as the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.300 
not making a lot of juice such as the
jackfruit<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.540> I<00:04:58.050> like<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.410> take<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.889> reduce

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
jackfruit is I like to take and reduce

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.090 
jackfruit is I like to take and reduce
the<00:04:59.520> pulp<00:04:59.760> now<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.630> can<00:05:01.020> reduce<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.620> pulp<00:05:01.860> on

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
the pulp now you can reduce the pulp on

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.310 
the pulp now you can reduce the pulp on
some<00:05:02.610> produce<00:05:02.880> items<00:05:03.300> sometimes<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.870> reduce

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
some produce items sometimes you reduce

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.020 
some produce items sometimes you reduce
Pulp<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.889> verdant<00:05:05.310> will<00:05:05.460> actually<00:05:05.789> clog

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
Pulp in the verdant will actually clog

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.640 
Pulp in the verdant will actually clog
the<00:05:06.210> bird<00:05:06.389> up<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:06.900> work<00:05:07.169> well<00:05:07.380> with

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the bird up and not work well with

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.620 
the bird up and not work well with
jackfruit<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.700> shouldn't<00:05:09.030> be<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> problem<00:05:09.180> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
jackfruit it shouldn't be a problem and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.570 
jackfruit it shouldn't be a problem and
it<00:05:09.690> should<00:05:09.840> work<00:05:09.870> fairly<00:05:10.320> well<00:05:10.470> now<00:05:11.430> we're

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
it should work fairly well now we're

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820 
it should work fairly well now we're
going<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.729> reduce<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.210> pulp<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.840> normally

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
going to reduce the pulp and normally

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.740 
going to reduce the pulp and normally
when<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.010> reduce<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.669> full<00:05:14.910> bottle<00:05:15.270> I'll<00:05:15.389> juice

like a quarter cup of juice and this is
one<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.639> primary<00:06:03.210> reasons<00:06:03.389> I<00:06:03.690> don't

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
one of the primary reasons I don't

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.320 
one of the primary reasons I don't
necessarily<00:06:04.110> recommend<00:06:04.880> juicing<00:06:05.880> fruits

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
necessarily recommend juicing fruits

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.730 
necessarily recommend juicing fruits
because<00:06:06.479> in<00:06:06.660> general<00:06:07.080> they're<00:06:07.199> not<00:06:07.440> in<00:06:07.680> a

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
because in general they're not in a

like bananas and mangos you know those

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.610 
like bananas and mangos you know those
are<00:06:32.280> definitely<00:06:32.790> best<00:06:33.120> blended<00:06:33.780> so<00:06:34.080> don't

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
are definitely best blended so don't

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.379 
are definitely best blended so don't
even<00:06:34.740> bother<00:06:34.919> juicing<00:06:35.400> them<00:06:35.460> anyways<00:06:36.180> let's

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
go ahead and turn this machine off it's

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.460 
go ahead and turn this machine off it's
been<00:06:38.700> a<00:06:38.729> satisfactory<00:06:39.450> job<00:06:39.930> for<00:06:40.200> what<00:06:40.350> it<00:06:40.440> is

you can't do it with the Omega vert 350
juicer<00:07:13.560> once<00:07:13.710> again<00:07:13.979> I<00:07:14.190> don't<00:07:14.460> recommend

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
juicer once again I don't recommend

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:16.700 
juicer once again I don't recommend
doing<00:07:15.000> this<00:07:15.210> didn't<00:07:15.990> make<00:07:16.110> a<00:07:16.139> lot<00:07:16.320> of<00:07:16.349> juice

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
doing this didn't make a lot of juice

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.650 
doing this didn't make a lot of juice
but<00:07:17.310> in<00:07:17.460> the<00:07:17.550> case<00:07:17.760> where<00:07:18.000> we<00:07:18.030> have<00:07:18.150> jacked

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
but in the case where we have jacked

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.879 
but in the case where we have jacked
with<00:07:18.810> it<00:07:18.930> didn't<00:07:19.200> taste<00:07:19.380> so<00:07:19.590> good

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
with it didn't taste so good

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.920 
with it didn't taste so good
this<00:07:20.400> really<00:07:20.760> ramped<00:07:21.180> the<00:07:21.360> flavor<00:07:21.630> and

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
this really ramped the flavor and

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.170 
this really ramped the flavor and
intensifies<00:07:22.590> the<00:07:22.830> flavor<00:07:23.099> makes<00:07:23.760> it<00:07:23.940> taste

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
intensifies the flavor makes it taste

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.839 
intensifies the flavor makes it taste
much<00:07:24.450> better<00:07:24.780> than<00:07:25.410> it<00:07:25.560> is<00:07:25.710> so<00:07:26.280> I<00:07:26.310> recommend

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
much better than it is so I recommend
