00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.020
 The Park Villa in Kressbronn near Lake Constance can be here in five 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.580
 luxurious 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.509
 solve apartments and a suite 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.999
 20 people holiday at the same time 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.789
 the particular thing heated the resort is not with oil or gas 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
 but with the help of water and ice 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.140
 there were two things to choose from two times to choose the also prompt 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.170
 Although there is still something about the thing you read a lot it goes 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.539
 Front ensure the Bop ROE and are not effective 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.260
 and the Federal Institute for Groups has to look for something else 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.530
 becomes common 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.530
 and look forward to the environment and then 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.970
 this plant into conversation 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.060
 That's what's new, it's innovative 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.000
 that was Motorsport but what the first ones did 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.520
 and are at the moment 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.870
 with a trial period 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.460
 show 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.540
 The idea for heating with water comes from topics Alexander von Rohr leads 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.420
 together with Heiko Lüdemann the shops of this valley in 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.620
 Friedrichshafen 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.870
 the principle of storing the heat of summer for the next winter if that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.370
 Marler like this 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.960
 we store the heat at a low temperature level in one 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 underground storage 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.540
 the heat comes over our solar as correction speaks with Lehmann on this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.790
 heat and the heat of the ambient air come in against them 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 Store rich at this store by the geothermal heat we gain 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 because the memory is buried in the ground and the earth is one 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 Temperature of about 8 to 12 degrees and our storage and the medium 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.650
 heated and a heat pump then give this heat to the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.360
 Building off 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.300
 In the summer, the whole thing happens the other way round, then the ice is used to 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.200
 Rooms in the Kressbronn Parc Ela to cool down a few degrees 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.869
 and heat at no extra cost with the help of 1 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.729
 this becomes possible due to the crystallizing Sander GI 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:53.750
 released 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.440
 because water to ice freezes in the moment molecules are in the moment 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.140
 they do not want to move anymore, they never want to give it away 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.800
 We can harness the synergies in the form of heat 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.920
 You may know this from this little mushroom that you can ski 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.450
 we just use it to make it a bit bigger we build storage 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.600
 between ten thousand liters and several million liters 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.739
 at the Park Ville is located under the garage in the heating system 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.189
 housed is still a garage 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.129
 it serves as water drank that this not only when the water becomes ice 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.229
 also for this is an invention of Isocal responsible if water 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.909
 freezes from water to ice and it expands and becomes that with the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.899
 Problem to do that explosive effect 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.849
 Water usually freezes from outside to inside and promptly down to the top 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.629
 because they know the explosive effect when they put a bottle of water into it 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.679
 Lay freezer and watch then eventually burst 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.190
 We make it different here 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.269
 from bottom to top and from inside to outside 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.959
 We also make our heat exchanger arrangement patented by Vonns 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.309
 let's say the games are playing at the lowest point in the middle and first 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.000
 Damon and then slowly outward or work slowly with ours 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.150
 freeze outward before the volume change so speak the water what 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.389
 wants to expand now 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.479
 Sheen wants to escape to the top 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:15.049
 But not only the egg is responsible for the $ 1 system of Isocal for heat 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.209
 The company also relies on the power of the sun 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.809
 and if it does not shine then the collectors will take that too 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.719
 Ambient temperature and then store the heat two of anger 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.150
 Collector once the visible surface where the sun shines on it 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.599
 Use here to choose the heat of the sun 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.099
 but we do not have several levels so the sun does not 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.659
 can be reached directly but enlarge the surface of our collector 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.379
 and we also absorb the heat from the ambient air here 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.699
 that is especially interesting then because as said the sun is not shining 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.689
 but also at night 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.849
 Here we can ward off heat in London Spyder 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.419
 it goes after the responsible ones with Isocal then the are 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.790
 Collectors of the future not only on roofs 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.769
 but possibly also in house facades the place on the roof 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.090
 would then be free for photovoltaic systems which could in turn with the help of 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.150
 Solar ice cream is cooled to its optimum operating temperature 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.979
 The goal is a house completely independent of fossil fuels 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.180
 can provide itself with energy 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.180
 and the visions at Isocal go further into the future 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.829
 until the football World Cup 2022 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.750
 all our vision is in the parcel of the football stadiums in Qatar 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.700
 air-condition 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.400
 there is still a bit of time but this system would be perfect 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.590
 suitable because we have our sun in these countries where we have a lot of sun 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.540
 Heat pump can operate with the power of the sun and out of the force of 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.820
 Sun can make a price to address the football stadiums 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.939
 sounds utopian we make it Oriental 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.059
 as at the park, Kressbronn arrive 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.299
 Klaus Straub now has his heating system on for about a year 

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:58.509
 the electricity meter he makes it now more fun again 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.409
 in five to seven years, the plant has amortized estimated from René a 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.820
 UN are no longer effective energy consumption is Prokofiev effort 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.020
 Stanton judges themselves see one year 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.900
 2009 immediately hours 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.860
 for the heating 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.110
 that is a very shortened to 1 2 3 on 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.680
 the heat from the 1st 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.880
 certainly an idea 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.039
 with good future prospects
