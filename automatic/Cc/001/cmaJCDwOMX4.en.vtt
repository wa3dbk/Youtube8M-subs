00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the photos 5 avail but that will

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
the photos 5 avail but that will
probably<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.020> game<00:01:07.409> world<00:01:07.710> where<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.460> will

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
probably be a game world where we will

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
probably be a game world where we will
set<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> macarena<00:01:09.600> Steve<00:01:10.049> arena<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
maybe some other plugins that we can use

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
maybe some other plugins that we can use
like<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> Hunger<00:01:13.590> Games<00:01:13.799> Rayna<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.400> something

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.230 
like this so this is a span of the plot
world<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.400> people<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.610> building<00:01:32.820> which

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
world and people are building which

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.609 
world and people are building which
houses<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.720> also<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
houses here you can see also this is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.490 
houses here you can see also this is
already<00:01:37.979> built<00:01:38.340> pretty<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
already built pretty much because the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.469 
already built pretty much because the
server<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:41.369> already<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> long<00:01:42.270> time

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
server was already for a long time

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
server was already for a long time
because<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.990> issue<00:01:43.140> system<00:01:43.590> outdated

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
because some issue system outdated

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.440 
because some issue system outdated
plugin<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.939> couldn't<00:01:45.329> actually<00:01:47.450> put

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
plugin so we couldn't actually put

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179
