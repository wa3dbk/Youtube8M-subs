guys well again his upper arms are out

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.620 
guys well again his upper arms are out
to<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> side<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.580> angle<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.970> work<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> upper

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to the side the angle of work the upper

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
to the side the angle of work the upper
arms<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.080> perpendicular<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.490> upper<00:01:08.790> body
