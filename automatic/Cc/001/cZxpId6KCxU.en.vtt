00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
using black liquid eyeliner it might

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.720 
using black liquid eyeliner it might
create<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.140> mess<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.489> why<00:00:44.700> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
spaces so that flat can stand out a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
spaces so that flat can stand out a
little<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.570> skip<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> step<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
little more you can skip that step is
totally<00:01:31.979> optional<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
totally optional then I'm just going to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.850 
totally optional then I'm just going to
go<00:01:33.540> over<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.079> again<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.560> liquid

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
go over it again with some liquid

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
go over it again with some liquid
eyeliner<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.880> stand<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
eyeliner just so it can stand out and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
eyeliner just so it can stand out and
then<00:01:37.170> fill<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> end<00:01:37.950> wing<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.610> black

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
then fill that end wing with black

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
then fill that end wing with black
eyeshadow<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.470> debt<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
eyeshadow so it has more debt and it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
eyeshadow so it has more debt and it
just<00:01:42.180> makes<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.630> cooler<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.409> mean<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
just makes it look cooler I mean like I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980 
just makes it look cooler I mean like I
said<00:01:43.890> everything<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.610> optional<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
said everything is optional but you can

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.679 
said everything is optional but you can
just<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> style<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> really

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
just go for the style of it but I really

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.139 
just go for the style of it but I really
think<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.290> black<00:01:50.070> eyeshadow<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.820> made<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
think that black eyeshadow just made it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.760 
think that black eyeshadow just made it
way<00:01:51.299> that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
way that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.139 
way that
then<00:01:52.399> I'm<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.670> go<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:52.939> with<00:01:52.969> my

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
then I'm going to go in with my

they're super dramatic so they're not

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.450 
they're super dramatic so they're not
anything<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:05.020> simple<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.319> it<00:02:07.009> does<00:02:07.219> take

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
anything like simple and it does take

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.430 
anything like simple and it does take
some<00:02:07.700> hard<00:02:07.939> work<00:02:08.239> in<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.569> steady<00:02:08.810> hand<00:02:08.929> that's

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
some hard work in a steady hand that's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.890 
some hard work in a steady hand that's
why<00:02:09.590> i'm<00:02:09.709> using<00:02:09.950> eyeshadow<00:02:10.099> at<00:02:10.549> first<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.360> used

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
why i'm using eyeshadow at first I used

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.240 
why i'm using eyeshadow at first I used
to<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.140> go<00:02:12.290> straight<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:12.890> with<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> liquid

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to just go straight in with a liquid

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.490 
to just go straight in with a liquid
eyeliner<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:13.879> that's<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> mistake<00:02:14.510> then<00:02:15.410> I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
eyeliner but that's a mistake then I'm

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.220 
eyeliner but that's a mistake then I'm
taking<00:02:15.530> these<00:02:15.980> natural<00:02:16.459> Demi's<00:02:17.230> eyelashes

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
taking these natural Demi's eyelashes

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.199 
taking these natural Demi's eyelashes
they<00:02:18.530> look<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.950> doll<00:02:19.220> lashes<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.879> me<00:02:20.000> they

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
they look like doll lashes to me they

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.789 
they look like doll lashes to me they
don't<00:02:20.360> really<00:02:20.450> look<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.720> natural<00:02:21.379> but<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
don't really look that natural but I

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.680 
don't really look that natural but I
think<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.400> were<00:02:22.519> perfect<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.299> look<00:02:23.569> we

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
think they were perfect for this look we

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.270 
think they were perfect for this look we
don't<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.110> take<00:02:24.410> away<00:02:24.590> too<00:02:24.739> much<00:02:25.040> from

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
don't want to take away too much from

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.390 
don't want to take away too much from
their<00:02:25.489> design<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.150> created<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.200> also<00:02:27.400> we

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
their design that we created but also we

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.740 
their design that we created but also we
want<00:02:28.640> our<00:02:28.790> eyelashes<00:02:29.390> stand<00:02:29.870> out<00:02:30.110> anyway<00:02:30.650> so

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
want our eyelashes stand out anyway so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.660 
want our eyelashes stand out anyway so
these<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.959> completed<00:02:33.620> eyes<00:02:36.010> now<00:02:37.010> what<00:02:37.640> I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
these are the completed eyes now what I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.030 
these are the completed eyes now what I
do<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:38.599> make<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.019> look<00:02:39.140> even<00:02:39.349> better<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:40.010> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
do to make it look even better is to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.180 
do to make it look even better is to
clean<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.549> those<00:02:40.730> black<00:02:41.209> edges<00:02:41.799> because<00:02:42.799> they

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
clean up those black edges because they

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.650 
clean up those black edges because they
didn't<00:02:43.459> look<00:02:43.549> as<00:02:43.730> sharp<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.299> me<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.569> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
didn't look as sharp to me in the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.380 
didn't look as sharp to me in the
beginning<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.860> technically<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.970> isn't

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
beginning so technically it's a it isn't

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.539 
beginning so technically it's a it isn't
complete<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.019> pretty<00:02:48.319> much<00:02:48.410> after<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.220> do

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
complete but pretty much after you do

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.369 
complete but pretty much after you do
that<00:02:49.579> then<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.269> whole<00:02:50.480> entire<00:02:50.720> look<00:02:51.260> of

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
that then your whole entire look of

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.589
