00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.830 
they're not just playing with it because
it's<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.739> bit<00:03:45.100> faster<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.579> bit<00:03:45.730> lighter<00:03:45.940> or<00:03:46.630> maybe

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's a bit faster a bit lighter or maybe

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.229 
it's a bit faster a bit lighter or maybe
