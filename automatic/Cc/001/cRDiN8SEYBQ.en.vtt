00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
greatest of what's going on and my most

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.990 
greatest of what's going on and my most
recent<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.799> spells<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.880> out

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
recent one I think really spells it out

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.609 
recent one I think really spells it out
pretty<00:01:30.240> well<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:30.930> touch<00:01:31.409> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pretty well because I really touch on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.030 
pretty well because I really touch on
this<00:01:31.770> oh<00:01:32.009> ID<00:01:32.220> process<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> two<00:01:34.500> forms<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
this oh ID process and the two forms of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.819 
this oh ID process and the two forms of
accounting<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.509> public<00:01:37.049> accounting

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
accounting because the public accounting

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.730 
accounting because the public accounting
has<00:01:38.509> absolutely<00:01:39.509> nothing<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.710> with

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
has absolutely nothing to do with

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.460 
has absolutely nothing to do with
private<00:01:41.490> accounting<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.079> private

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
private accounting so there is private

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.889 
private accounting so there is private
being<00:01:43.649> meaning<00:01:44.070> between<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> me<00:01:44.909> it's

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
being meaning between you and me it's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620 
being meaning between you and me it's
like<00:01:46.079> completely<00:01:46.890> separate<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.090> fact<00:01:48.360> if

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like completely separate and in fact if

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
like completely separate and in fact if
indeed<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.229> intend<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> charge<00:01:50.100> us

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
indeed they could intend to charge us

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.770 
indeed they could intend to charge us
what<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.119> doing<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> they're

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
what they're doing is they're

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
what they're doing is they're

obstructing the bankruptcy and they're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.520 
obstructing the bankruptcy and they're
