00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.480

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.310
 blade steel here 420 lining out 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.329
 bright mahogany steel bolster 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.290
 steel toe construction futon to 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.040
 Misha suggested making a few 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.890
 test options 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.190
 this is a kitchen test and a dis test for 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 reza crash test but we will do something more 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.700
 interesting 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.510
 today we will check this knife on a fool 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.429
 sustainability 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.899
 Well, the first test is as far as 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:50.059
 tightly he is held in these leather 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.460
 sheath oh so the first test of this knife 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.899
 this test is so next edge i 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 could they chop or deliver but 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.190
 it is unlikely you will be interested to see 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.010
 Therefore, I propose to immediately go to our 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.839
 wonderful silk jars red Price 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.680
 product so as not to pollute 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.950
 Wednesday, of course, we take with us 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.860
 but let's look at so much with them 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.020
 well sharpened for the knife I think that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 that is enough 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 let's get started 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 this is the most disgusting thing that all 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.940
 ever 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.940
 the knife 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.130
 there is 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.280
 nutritionally smeared with wooden glory 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.450
 god we have napkins 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.170

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.890
 unholy pot of red tea using 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.720
 our wonderful experimental self 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.590
 I will try to make beautiful shots 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.989
 sloughed and do n't she boldly 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.690
 cut through with such a comparatively 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.980
 not long onion Kubanka but in extreme 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.980
 as soon as I can hurt 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.790
 and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.720
 and since we all know the test for 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.230
 since we are testing the knife today 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.489
 fool resistance 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.630
 who as not a brick will help us with it 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.440

 it looks like he won't be this time 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.620
 so develop such a fool who is not 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.620
 will throw his knife 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.090
 so the knife is intact 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.900
 Well, let's cut it all 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.720

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:38.490
