 10 Voracious Computer Games 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.429
 in the enterprise as 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.099
 is five people burned down 2 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.990
 April 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 special program and half 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 April early May 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.310
 Nikolai Vinnichenko May 2, the reflection of the most 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.170
 best virtual pilots from around the world 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.939
 Twitter trial at a time so simple 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.099
 virtual and real care they 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.580
 flooded expert gave the right 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.190
 each one 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.190
 for several years now if she is me 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.370
 the amount in this direction marks 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.190
 all sorts of limits 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 seems like a global ruby ​​surrounded 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 movements 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.150
 everybody knows 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.320
 gaming company 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.440
 according to the specialist 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.770
 were collected 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.430
 players from different countries including 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 intelligence 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 they are also our compatriot 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.030
 we were to spend 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.830
 three different buildings 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.080
 singled out power 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810
 first battle 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.649
 she was spread so 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.020
 called ship captain 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.350
 the main task was to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.240
 he 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.540
 so the biggest chemical michel 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.830
 Hapi opponent team 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.440
 since from us 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.570
 gathered almost 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.509
 in schools of Kyrgyzstan was less than 40 thousand 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.230
 person 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.450
 However, you can here another team here. 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.820
 there were 500 kilometers 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.170
 suddenly groups but small tof ships in 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.330
 details between fleets and tried like that 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.460
 time 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 The main tasks were performed as say 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.690
 opposing us the team was happening in 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.090
 pokachach 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.420
 their ships were 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 better armed 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.470
 they were better class 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.439
 one-room and destroy 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 15 5 or 6 percent of native recaro buckets 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.449
 that is, the main combat mission was 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.449
 recording capability 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.859
 just a participant in this event in total 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.609
 ship unfortunately was not but who managed 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.609
 manifest themselves to other events 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.839
 2 body ship interceptor tried 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.019
 destroy various deals 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.809
 with government support 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.809
 and even a company partner 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.359
 the old battle was the most interesting with 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.669
 my point of view 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.389
 this so-called battle is all against 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.089
 of all 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.149
 or there should be only one 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.059
 as they say actual 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:02.359
 also participated 880 people survived 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.949
 in case of defeat 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.119
 our foreign comrades 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.119
 or just a gap between themselves 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.339
 I arranged my stories 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.849
 acquaintances and we are united 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.449
 temporarily in command 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.759
 reported that destroy 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.179
 opponents but then each other like that 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 sort out 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.689
 thanks to this fairly simple 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.559
 how the systems got to the very end 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.559
 they were one of the last elections 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.949
 as the experience of past years of battle shows 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.059
 it was quite intense but 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.059
 move around the battlefield 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.459
 of accidents 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.789
 For example 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.099
 this battleship 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.400
 past our interceptors and 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.469
 to let out 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.469
 somewhere around him 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.450
 construction was specific 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.919
 and here I mentioned that in the first battle 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.069
 The largest ships took part 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.069
 Directorate of the Cannes Festival 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.489
 the strongest most powerful 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.499
 ship possessing better protection islam 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.189
 scary gun noise 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.489
 the so-called 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.489
 doomsday weapons 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.479
 winning fixtures 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.459
 which is activated only a time now 

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:29.159
 real 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.319
 true amount of siddhi equal area 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.249
 that is the scope all the ships where where 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.749
 then there is a key of two hundred and fifty 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.500
 kilometers around it 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.990
 are damaged and very significant 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 damage 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.959
 the task of ownership is that he has 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.110
 only one question which ships 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.889
 understandably people were preparing for such 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.370
 battles and since this is a super weapon 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.860
 really relics 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.830
 the main tactic feature was 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.229
 not even to put a huge 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.789
 damage blunt ship poll will be 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.710
 opportunity to survive 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.580
 one powerful but still one shot 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.680
 Well, then no longer is 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.330
 people shoot the ship as if it were not strong 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.569
 sooner or later explode 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.240
 here we see it 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.800
 beautiful blast 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 man died 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.210
 we turn in real 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.280
 so that in a week saturday will go 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.280
 conquer the virtual space 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.099
 and don't forget to pack for a fee 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.099
 courses they will definitely be useful to us 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.610
