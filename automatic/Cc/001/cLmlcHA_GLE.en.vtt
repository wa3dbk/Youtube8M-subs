00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.880
 Hello everyone today we are repairing 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:10.980
 such is the Chinese mouse genius 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:15.370
 model of it is jam 030 at 22 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.770
 lambada scroll here she has a problem 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.460
 next mouse pointer surimi 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.350
 twitches we will disassemble means here 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.830
 just one screw that can 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.780
 unscrew 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.480
 self-tapping screws are twisted pretty 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.260
 easy and fix them just one further 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.090
 Spatulas can simply pry the case 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.050
 there are two snaps here that need 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.160
 click here near the buttons themselves and their 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.559
 very holding on to the camera here I am 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.410
 couldn't click now i will put on 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.470
 pause did so it was convenient and 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.120
 click off one here we see a fee 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.549
 for a mouse, you can just take it out 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.100
 you need to do it carefully so as not to 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.739
 damage the optical sensor itself 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.280
 you can also click Chinese 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.979
 connector with wires 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 it snaps into pretty pretty spirit 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.320
 spout glass is not glued what and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.590
 should be expected from such mice here 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.859
 snap off the connector 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.049
 and in principle further we see that along the way 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:27.759
 the mouse was in the water because 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.840
 the board has such a white bloom 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.000
 the other side 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.149
 our task is all neatly 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.579
 clean che sit first because he 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.890
 evaporates very quickly and cleans well 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.259
 This Marek also need not forget 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.969
 clean this glass here 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.189
 covers the optical sensor do it 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.679
 need to be careful not to scratch java 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.959
 do in a rag that you can buy in 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.789
 store optics 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.369
 but in principle after the tedious process 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.939
 cleansing which I think everyone understands and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.329
 interesting pruning you can proceed to 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:09.899
 assembling the mouse the future on a little wheel 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:14.590
 lint have a wheel in place 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:19.780
 so that she does not walk and and to work in 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 scrolling here in principle is not here further 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.600
 difficult to insert a board 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.329
 lock and lock the top 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.840
 there is a cover there are two slots do not know 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:35.620
 you can not see them comes very hard 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.349
 the wire from courage at first he kinda 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:46.209
 fixed further expressed collected 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:48.060
 you can tighten the screw here these two slots 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.250
 showing again 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.100
 here are the buttons we are making everything 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.670
 works fine 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.270
 Here is the topaz is very important to hit 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.270
 body 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.740
 and here, in principle, gave quickly 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.970
 fasten a single screw 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.330
 which we hold the whole body of the mouse and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.350
 checking the mouse for performance here 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.570
 as if all the buttons work for us I have to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.970
 principle told showed 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.960
 loved place huskies
