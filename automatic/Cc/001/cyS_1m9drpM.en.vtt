00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.560
 as for a good relationship is the underlying issue is as complicated as 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.530
 is the issue of national security and that you know you will be interested in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.539
 in seizing this carry and their contention the organisms 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.789
 well I think split the meetings of unasur 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.439
 the satellite phones that exist 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.949
 in the space 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 hilary clear identification of where they are 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.509
 pagés 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.279
 that are allowed 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.240
 or that are left momoa state we add that Mr. Chávez is behind that 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.300
 because they would already be lacto of war 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.350
 direct 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.470
 and that does not stop 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470
 but despite being maybe maybe 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.870
 a few hours for that commented 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.420
 sir accept it planes we accept engineer who determine exactly 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.230
 and in real time at the moment we are sitting in a suite where 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.889
 is it so 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.999
 some camps we asked the president who said they go to the 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.800
 other side 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 since they cross the border where they are going to fight inside Colombia 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.990
 we see it in that as a refuge duty if it is so 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.330
 I do not want to venture 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.430
 probanza that topic but 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.370
 unasur should be that 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.380
 that is the place where it can be clearly demonstrated is this is demonstrated 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660
 clearly 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.799
 there is no way 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.719
 in which no polished country followed by letting do bad things 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.000
 within your territory there is no way 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.030
 that supports his opinion the proposal that precisely in interview for 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 stop the night 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.070
 well to the president of chile sebastián piñera and is to create percent a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.969
 certification mechanism within the 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.869
 unasur specifications the fight against terrorism and against crime that 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.249
 it could work clearly that what the baby from the liquidity certify what 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.970
 worse the certification 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.950
 with what encouragement do they come from 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.130
 i followed in a discussion with veil what certifies as satellites 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 do not put in the hands of human beings who are subjective but for that clear 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.490
 a mechanism precisely to be able to boost that Chinese capital opportunity 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.510
 that has a satellite exactly above us 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.939
 according to stationary 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.369
 skin to china that you take pictures from all the plains 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.629
 hilton shake hands in the tests 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.839
 evident 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.249
 in addition to the cooperation in that sense between eta and colombia farc 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.690
 as well as the bike that denies the voice of those who precisely summon 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.670
 the relationship of Peru and Colombia has been very strong and emphatic the fight against 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.410
 terrorism against drug trafficking we have some committees that work 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.980
 permanently two plus two chancellors that of foreign relations minister of 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.150
 defense that are constantly sitting down making bouquets too 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.450
 strategies in perfecting the stops fight and fight precisely 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.310
 these phenomena because if it can be done is an ideological stance is a 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.230
 principled stance is a clear interest because if it can be done 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.569
 because I saw 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.669
 in human life the community of interests in its original spirit 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.999
 the actions at 5 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.079
 and why are we one of the 21 serious countries 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.699
 we do not get rid of the scene 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.119
 theatrical 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.119
 we have nothing that separates us 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.899
 we are 76 million people 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.299
 or a growing level of consumption 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 who who lived series says drug trafficking issue 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.789
 Colombia has advanced more the rock had greater aid 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:30.469
 introduced messi here because you have three thousand hectares madeco 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.489
 he warmed up thanks to you president 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.239
 brown of puerto montt in colombia in the summary support 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.659
 I dont complain 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.199
 because it is a single space 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.529
 this is a subject that has to be treated the new continental blame the 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.989
 Colombia has the fault that Peru has made use of space 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.839
 this test list 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:54.249
 after the negotiation of the cocaine and its production I have always said here 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.599
 so there was also think 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.809
 I do not just need you to give me advice 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.819
 this is part of europe modern attitude 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.709
 the police pilot 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.939
 look, you are better than us in detecting ports and 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.109
 airports 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.669
 send me your advertising 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.519
 the ideam in that 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.600
 we will see what we can send you, we see that we are better 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.919
 I do not believe in those things of sovereignty 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.560
 in a time that everything is correlated and and the products 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.639
 people and and capitals go through the small border and governments are given 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.309
 account is that 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:33.339
 of course to stop those who understand these cooperation between Peru and 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.530
 colombia that bet 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.460
 that now but 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.280
 has been cataloged as the first coca producer 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.660
 the overcoming to colombia obviously you to president barak obama the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.110
 Plan Colombia has made these extras etc 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.740
 as in zero it worked in haro but what is the tool so that it does not 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.620
 move them 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.500
 precisely the problem from one country to the other panama are strategic allies 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.240
 seems that concrete proposal so that does not happen because in addition these 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.790
 manifestations of organized crime always look for a hundred do not end with 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.020
 what they do but will precisely look for territories 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.470
 the move to escampar 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.610
 how does it happen so that it does not happen in Peru so that it does not affect them that way 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.860
 the peru and colombia of the time of president virgilio boat was 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.360
 here 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.960
 to generate a movement 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960
 so that Colombia will not face drug trafficking 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.230
 II we call from here from Nariño 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.819
 well especially the south 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:28.990
 to bolivia 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.729
 united states and we met in cartagena later as president bush 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.120
 the first thing is the responsibility that accept it and the second is the 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.949
 economic co-responsibility 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.949
 the fight against drug trafficking is a matter of billions 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.389
 our cops timing hundreds of millions or tens of millions 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.919
 It gives me that it is up to the consumers to make a goal a contribution I 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.939
 I think the Colombian plan was well designed 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.860
 and I'm going to talk a lot about being a total subjugation of Colombia 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.409
 American empire chutes to theories 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:02.619
 I do not believe it that way 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.809
 I do not think so 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:08.990
 now it had to be the arabia europe to the culture it seems day consumes more 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:10.369
 cocaine 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.550
 and russia 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.759
 that the batteries are put as desired 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.210
 and before a plan 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.469
 that allows us to fight also all 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.599
 Uncle Sam 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.029
 president obama it seems that you have serious economic problems you get those 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.029
 countries and chubby to be in crisis and occupy 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:28.689
 for now they ask us a lot of money 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.220
 then you can not tell him 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.080
 contributions of Peru as it contributed in Colombia but 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.059
 apparently the world 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.449
 are committed to consumption and clear co-responsibility that we are 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.879
 looking for hours 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:44.830
 if it is that satellite technology supports the scanners all that 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.319
 you do very well 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.580
 in the capture of the pain that is coming out Colombia we want to repeat it
