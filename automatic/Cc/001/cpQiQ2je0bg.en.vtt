this<00:00:21.080> is<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.680> moss<00:00:21.920> stitch<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:23.720> want<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:23.990> work

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
this is the moss stitch you want to work

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.769 
this is the moss stitch you want to work
with<00:00:24.170> an<00:00:24.590> even<00:00:25.070> number<00:00:25.100> of<00:00:25.430> stitches<00:00:25.670> plus<00:00:26.360> one

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
with an even number of stitches plus one

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.420 
with an even number of stitches plus one
so<00:00:27.680> if<00:00:28.189> you<00:00:28.250> cast<00:00:28.700> on<00:00:29.740> twelve<00:00:30.740> stitches<00:00:31.040> you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
so if you cast on twelve stitches you

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.070 
so if you cast on twelve stitches you
would<00:00:31.550> want<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.790> cast<00:00:32.150> on<00:00:32.390> one<00:00:32.629> more<00:00:32.840> for

thirteen and that's how many I have

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.860 
thirteen and that's how many I have
in<00:00:35.150> this<00:00:35.900> example<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:38.239> all<00:00:38.330> you're<00:00:38.510> going<00:00:38.660> to
