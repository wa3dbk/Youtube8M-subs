00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
pretty much all why I was always kind of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
pretty much all why I was always kind of
turned<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> these

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
turned off by basically all of these

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
turned off by basically all of these
books<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> look<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> their<00:01:54.869> covers

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

them<00:02:01.829> sometimes<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.000> usually<00:02:03.420> end<00:02:03.750> up

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
them sometimes but I usually end up
