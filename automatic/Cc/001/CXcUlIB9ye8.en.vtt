00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
each case is the same from skin it as

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.750 
each case is the same from skin it as
they<00:00:50.550> feature<00:00:50.879> different<00:00:51.570> images<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they feature different images so this is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.569

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

so you might have to press it a little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
so you might have to press it a little
bit<00:01:19.050> more<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> person

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
bit more just to make sure the person

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.260 
bit more just to make sure the person
but<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.870> should<00:01:22.260> be<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:23.040> easy<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.760> install

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
but it should be pretty easy to install

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.120

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
itself and I go to school so I have to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.100 
itself and I go to school so I have to
do<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> lot<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> turn<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.450> on<00:02:57.570> after

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
do it a lot I have to turn it on after

school turn it on before school etc etc

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.530 
school turn it on before school etc etc
so<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> hassle<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:02.820> me<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
so it is kind of a hassle for me and it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.050 
so it is kind of a hassle for me and it
might<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.870> hassle<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.320> some<00:03:04.680> people<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
might be a hassle for some people but it

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.050 
might be a hassle for some people but it
is<00:03:06.299> obviously<00:03:06.750> really<00:03:06.989> easy<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
is obviously really easy just to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.159 
is obviously really easy just to
overcome<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> problem<00:03:09.389> by<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
overcome this problem by going to

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.920 
overcome this problem by going to
settings<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.709> then<00:03:11.070> turning<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.060> off<00:03:12.209> wire

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
settings and then turning it off wire

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.230 
settings and then turning it off wire
the<00:03:13.650> settings

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
the settings

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.970 
the settings
but<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.570> would<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.930> pretty<00:03:17.140> nice<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.590> see<00:03:17.800> this

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
but it would be pretty nice to see this

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.670 
but it would be pretty nice to see this
case<00:03:18.250> fixed<00:03:18.760> by<00:03:18.940> Skinit<00:03:19.390> it's<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.500> big

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
case fixed by Skinit it's not that big

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.010 
case fixed by Skinit it's not that big
of<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.950> problem<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.910> shouldn't<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.690> shouldn't

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
of a problem so I shouldn't it shouldn't

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.620

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
found out a really nice feature but also

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.030 
found out a really nice feature but also
the<00:03:36.220> materials<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.210> made<00:03:37.300> out<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:38.110> top

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
the materials it's made out of is top

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.760 
the materials it's made out of is top
