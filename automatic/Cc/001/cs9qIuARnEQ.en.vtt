there's<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.920> dirty<00:01:16.160> version<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:17.840> there's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
there's a dirty version and then there's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.880 
there's a dirty version and then there's
the<00:01:18.170> clean<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.770> prefer<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> clean<00:01:19.850> one

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
the clean one I prefer the clean one

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.150 
the clean one I prefer the clean one
because<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.010> dirty<00:01:22.220> just<00:01:22.520> looks<00:01:22.700> like<00:01:22.790> it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
because the dirty just looks like it's

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.450 
because the dirty just looks like it's
been<00:01:25.160> left<00:01:25.820> in<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:26.000> barn<00:01:26.240> for<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.979> whole<00:01:27.979> few

two-wheel drive the front end loader is
a<00:01:39.890> different<00:01:40.280> mod<00:01:42.040> that<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:43.310> put<00:01:44.090> dual

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
a different mod that you can put dual

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.960 
a different mod that you can put dual
wheels<00:01:44.509> on<00:01:44.720> it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
wheels on it

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.240 
wheels on it
push<00:01:46.970> your<00:01:47.119> M<00:01:47.330> takes<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.170> dual<00:01:48.350> wheels<00:01:48.560> off<00:01:51.250> so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
push your M takes the dual wheels off so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.940 
push your M takes the dual wheels off so
obviously<00:01:52.460> spacebar<00:01:52.880> locks<00:01:53.780> your<00:01:53.990> camera<00:01:54.740> you

that's<00:02:25.890> pretty<00:02:26.099> much<00:02:26.189> all<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.430> did

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.589 

so<00:02:30.640> I'm<00:02:30.849> going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> go<00:02:31.209> ahead<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.450> start

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
so I'm going to go ahead and start

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.720 
so I'm going to go ahead and start
planting

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
planting

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.309 
planting
stuff<00:02:33.270> with<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.130> big<00:02:35.130> loader<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:38.430> there<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
stuff with the big loader over there and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.900 
stuff with the big loader over there and
you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.709> run<00:02:40.890> through<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> tires<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.640> think

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
you can run through the tires I think

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.010 
you can run through the tires I think
they<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.599> they<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:42.840> make<00:02:43.020> marks<00:02:43.319> oh<00:02:43.560> well

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
they know they don't make marks oh well

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.250 
they know they don't make marks oh well
so<00:02:46.020> I'm<00:02:46.200> willing<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.440> plant<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.989> am<00:02:48.989> guessing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so I'm willing to plant I am guessing

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.339 
so I'm willing to plant I am guessing
