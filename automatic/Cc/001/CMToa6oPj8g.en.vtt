00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.940 
died in the flood some that were perhaps
even<00:02:30.079> taken<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.799> ark<00:02:32.290> survived<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.769> grew

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
even taken on the ark survived and grew

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.009 
even taken on the ark survived and grew
up<00:02:34.159> but<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.519> climate<00:02:35.060> change<00:02:35.389> did<00:02:35.659> not<00:02:35.780> allow

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
up but the climate change did not allow

up but the climate change did not allow
for<00:02:36.049> them<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.469> become<00:02:37.060> very<00:02:38.060> prevalent<00:02:38.359> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
for them to become very prevalent and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.300 
for them to become very prevalent and
eventually<00:02:39.319> they<00:02:39.469> died<00:02:39.680> out<00:02:39.889> because<00:02:40.040> of

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
eventually they died out because of

eventually they died out because of
climate<00:02:40.459> changes<00:02:41.109> but<00:02:42.109> at<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.439> end<00:02:42.469> of<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
day I have no problem with dinosaurs
