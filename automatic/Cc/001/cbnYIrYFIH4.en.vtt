00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:32.550 

the<00:00:23.820> left<00:00:24.030> hand<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:24.870> F

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.160 

I'm<00:00:32.950> going<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.160> show<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.310> how<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.550> do<00:00:33.790> that<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
I'm going to show you how to do that in

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.710 
I'm going to show you how to do that in
three<00:00:35.590> different<00:00:36.240> courts<00:00:37.240> so<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.570> could

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
three different courts so that you could

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.330 
three different courts so that you could
you<00:00:37.990> could<00:00:38.020> do<00:00:38.260> this<00:00:38.380> as<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.590> fill<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.100> say<00:00:39.280> for

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
you could do this as a fill like say for

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.950 
you could do this as a fill like say for
jingle<00:00:39.850> bells<00:00:40.030> or<00:00:40.210> anything<00:00:40.450> that<00:00:40.660> you<00:00:40.810> want

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
jingle bells or anything that you want

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.370 
jingle bells or anything that you want

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
to add a blues little bluesy fill - okay

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:55.380 
to add a blues little bluesy fill - okay
so<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.650> is<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:44.950> an<00:00:45.070> F<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:46.690> go<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.090> start

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
so this is on an F we go so we start

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.020 
so this is on an F we go so we start
with<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.630> F<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.860> we<00:00:56.890> go<00:00:57.070> up<00:00:57.220> here<00:00:57.250> as<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.850> F

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
with the F then we go up here as the F

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.880 
with the F then we go up here as the F
and<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.540> C<00:00:58.810> which<00:00:59.080> is<00:00:59.290> the<00:01:00.270> dominant<00:01:01.270> note<00:01:01.390> C<00:01:01.900> F

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
and the C which is the dominant note C F

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.490 
and the C which is the dominant note C F
the<00:01:03.280> tonic<00:01:03.640> note<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.110> here's<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.470> triplet<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
the tonic note so here's the triplet and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.890 
the tonic note so here's the triplet and
what<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.650> did<00:01:08.890> here<00:01:08.920> was<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.460> I'm<00:01:09.790> outlining<00:01:10.180> the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
what I did here was I I'm outlining the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.770 
what I did here was I I'm outlining the
four<00:01:11.200> chord<00:01:11.560> on<00:01:11.770> an<00:01:11.890> F<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:13.000> four<00:01:13.240> chord<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.660> an

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
four chord on an F the four chord of an

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.190 
four chord on an F the four chord of an
F<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.190> B<00:01:15.340> flat<00:01:15.520> chord<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.510> for<00:01:16.960> playing

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
F it's a B flat chord and so for playing

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.440 
F it's a B flat chord and so for playing
like<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.410> that's<00:01:17.979> an<00:01:18.160> inverted<00:01:18.700> b-flat<00:01:19.240> do

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
like that that's an inverted b-flat do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.920 
like that that's an inverted b-flat do
you<00:01:19.510> see<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:20.460> flat<00:01:21.460> D<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.600> F<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.810> on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
you see that a flat D but the F is on

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.230 
you see that a flat D but the F is on
the<00:01:23.020> bottom<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.500> we<00:01:23.619> have<00:01:26.910> so<00:01:27.910> it's<00:01:28.119> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the bottom so we have so it's the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.740 
the bottom so we have so it's the
triplets<00:01:28.600> -<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.990> an<00:01:29.080> eighth<00:01:32.040> okay<00:01:33.750> then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
triplets - this is an eighth okay then

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.160 
triplets - this is an eighth okay then
if<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.890> put<00:01:36.160> your<00:01:36.610> hand<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> F<00:01:37.630> try<00:01:37.990> out

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
if you put your hand in the F try out

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.550 
if you put your hand in the F try out
here<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.490> instead<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.450> playing<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
here and instead of playing the a and

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.770 
here and instead of playing the a and
the<00:01:41.679> C<00:01:41.710> we're<00:01:42.280> gonna<00:01:42.369> go<00:01:42.640> down<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:42.970> half<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.539> step

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
the C we're gonna go down a half a step

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.359 
the C we're gonna go down a half a step
from<00:01:43.960> each<00:01:44.140> one<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.410> those<00:01:44.590> notes<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.100> we<00:01:45.130> have

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
from each one of those notes so we have

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:54.960 
from each one of those notes so we have
a<00:01:45.580> flat<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:46.119> B<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.710> next<00:01:53.890> triplet<00:01:54.429> so

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
a flat and B that's the next triplet so

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.130 
a flat and B that's the next triplet so
we<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.600> an<00:01:55.720> eighth<00:01:55.869> note<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.899> next

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
we have an eighth note and then the next

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.590 
we have an eighth note and then the next
triplet<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.830> half<00:02:00.220> step<00:02:00.460> down<00:02:00.670> each<00:02:01.270> from

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
triplet is a half step down each from

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.010 
triplet is a half step down each from
the<00:02:01.780> triad

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.420 

all<00:02:05.229> right<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.799> now<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.640> go

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.290 

here<00:02:12.430> we're<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:13.030> down<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> whole<00:02:13.570> step

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.620 

and<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.480> back<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.500> F<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and we're back at the F and the a so the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.160 
and we're back at the F and the a so the
whole<00:02:21.780> thing<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:23.459> eighth<00:02:23.670> note<00:02:24.170> here's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
whole thing is the eighth note here's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
whole thing is the eighth note here's
our<00:02:25.319> trip<00:02:25.530> blue<00:02:27.050> there's<00:02:28.050> our<00:02:28.230> four<00:02:28.470> chord<00:02:29.090> now

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
our trip blue there's our four chord now

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.580 
our trip blue there's our four chord now
step<00:02:30.390> down<00:02:30.630> from<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> triad<00:02:33.110> triplet<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
step down from the triad triplet and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:45.720 
step down from the triad triplet and
then<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:34.980> ways

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.400 

I'll<00:02:46.270> do<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> seat<00:02:48.930> all<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.349> to
