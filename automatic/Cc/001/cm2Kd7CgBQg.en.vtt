be talking about my update for week for
weight<00:00:05.130> watchers<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.779> I<00:00:06.779> measured<00:00:07.230> myself

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
weight watchers and I measured myself

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.250 
weight watchers and I measured myself
and<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.849> went<00:00:09.090> based<00:00:09.269> off<00:00:09.450> measurements<00:00:10.110> from

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and I went based off measurements from

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.749 
and I went based off measurements from
January<00:00:10.889> because<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.280> kept<00:00:11.429> forgetting<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
January because I kept forgetting to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.020 
January because I kept forgetting to
measure<00:00:11.969> myself<00:00:12.710> but<00:00:13.710> during<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.519> time<00:00:14.849> when

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
measure myself but during that time when

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.019 
measure myself but during that time when
I<00:00:15.059> mentioned<00:00:15.269> myself<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:16.109> at<00:00:16.260> 193<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.850> one

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I mentioned myself I was at 193 just one

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.760 
I mentioned myself I was at 193 just one
pound<00:00:18.210> difference<00:00:18.470> from<00:00:19.470> when<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.680> started

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
pound difference from when I started

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.300 
pound difference from when I started
weight<00:00:20.160> watchers<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.880> assuming<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
weight watchers so I'm assuming that the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
weight watchers so I'm assuming that the
measurements<00:00:23.310> were<00:00:23.400> about<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.820> same<00:00:24.859> roughly

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
measurements were about the same roughly

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.359 
measurements were about the same roughly
and<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:27.289> no<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:28.560> won't<00:00:28.859> believe<00:00:29.039> me<00:00:29.189> there

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and if no don't won't believe me there

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.890 
and if no don't won't believe me there
then<00:00:29.640> we'll<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.880> based<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.330> want<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
then we'll just go based off want to

top nothing's my hands or anything and I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
top nothing's my hands or anything and I
weighed<00:01:32.189> myself<00:01:32.369> after<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> went<00:01:33.450> pee<00:01:33.659> because

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
weighed myself after I went pee because

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.789 
weighed myself after I went pee because
those<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> fan<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:36.840> weighed<00:01:37.590> in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
those kind of fan there and I weighed in

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.319 
those kind of fan there and I weighed in
at<00:01:38.900> 185<00:01:39.900> point<00:01:40.409> six<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.820> means<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
at 185 point six so that means that I

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.749 
at 185 point six so that means that I

gonna start doing that way myself every

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.699 
gonna start doing that way myself every

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.580 
the last video I told you my stomach
area<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.300> seems<00:03:36.510> different<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.380> when<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
area just seems different and now when I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.050 
area just seems different and now when I
look<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.890> mirror<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.340> still<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.940> that

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
look in the mirror I still have that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.259 
look in the mirror I still have that
little<00:03:39.769> touch<00:03:40.769> right<00:03:41.580> there<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.090> belly

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
little touch right there on my belly

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.300 
little touch right there on my belly
when<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.600> little<00:03:42.739> tire<00:03:43.739> right<00:03:43.950> there<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
when that little tire right there and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.830 
when that little tire right there and
then<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.430> still<00:03:44.670> have<00:03:44.760> my<00:03:44.820> love<00:03:44.970> handles<00:03:45.180> but

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
then I still have my love handles but

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.759 
then I still have my love handles but
it's<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.380> as<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:47.450> defined<00:03:48.450> tour<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.930> big

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
it's not as a defined tour it's like big

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.580 
it's not as a defined tour it's like big
small<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.730> big<00:03:51.239> hips<00:03:51.570> because<00:03:52.080> my<00:03:52.230> love

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
small and big hips because my love

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.710 
small and big hips because my love
handles<00:03:52.800> it's<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.100> little<00:03:53.280> bit<00:03:53.400> less<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.630> my

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
handles it's a little bit less and in my

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.479 
handles it's a little bit less and in my
stomach<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.350> smoother<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.280> for

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
stomach it just smoother it's just for

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.250 
stomach it just smoother it's just for
some<00:03:56.610> reason<00:03:56.640> right<00:03:57.420> under<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.780> bra<00:03:57.959> area

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
some reason right under the bra area

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.710 
some reason right under the bra area
right<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.560> wire<00:03:58.769> under<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> wire<00:03:59.720> that

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
right with a wire under the wire that

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.620 
right with a wire under the wire that
that<00:04:01.110> area<00:04:01.440> right<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:02.040> less<00:04:02.700> fatty<00:04:03.269> and

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
that area right there is less fatty and

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.280 
that area right there is less fatty and
its<00:04:04.560> length<00:04:05.400> look<00:04:05.820> smoother<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.050> doesn't

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
its length look smoother so it doesn't

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.630 
its length look smoother so it doesn't
like<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.830> don't<00:04:08.100> know<00:04:08.220> there's<00:04:08.400> not<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.519> many

definitely keep fruits and vegetables in
every<00:04:46.720> meal<00:04:46.900> which<00:04:47.199> I've<00:04:47.320> been<00:04:47.350> trying<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.800> do

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
every meal which I've been trying to do

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.060 
every meal which I've been trying to do
so<00:04:48.610> I'm<00:04:49.000> hoping<00:04:49.300> now<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.650> actually

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
so I'm hoping now that this is actually

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.029 
so I'm hoping now that this is actually
working<00:04:51.660> really<00:04:52.660> well<00:04:52.810> with<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.740> last<00:04:53.889> time

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
working really well with it in last time

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.490 
working really well with it in last time
that<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.910> will<00:04:55.360> actually<00:04:55.810> put<00:04:56.050> more<00:04:56.199> effort

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
that I will actually put more effort
