they'll just just suck it in that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.149 
they'll just just suck it in that
slightest<00:02:41.840> little<00:02:41.959> bit<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.530> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.129> miss

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
slightest little bit and if you miss

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.039

time<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.650> find<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> nano<00:02:46.400> fill

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
time and you find that the nano fill

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
time and you find that the nano fill
provides<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.659> detection<00:02:48.079> better<00:02:48.500> than<00:02:48.739> any

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
provides that detection better than any

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.789 
provides that detection better than any
other<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.540> there's<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.870> great<00:02:51.109> reason<00:02:51.379> to<00:02:51.560> use
