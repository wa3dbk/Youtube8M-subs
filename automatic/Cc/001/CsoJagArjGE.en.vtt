that number backs up that it's working

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.750 
that number backs up that it's working
so<00:02:52.379> far<00:02:52.410> yeah<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.799> mean<00:02:52.890> every<00:02:53.310> turnover<00:02:53.519> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
so far yeah I mean every turnover you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.979 
so far yeah I mean every turnover you
force<00:02:54.030> increases<00:02:54.299> your<00:02:54.569> chances<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.930> winning

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
force increases your chances of winning

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.420 
force increases your chances of winning
a<00:02:55.260> game<00:02:55.410> straight<00:02:55.739> up<00:02:55.859> by<00:02:55.980> about<00:02:56.069> 20

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
a game straight up by about 20

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.530 
a game straight up by about 20
percentage<00:02:56.849> points<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.359> pretty

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
percentage points it's a pretty

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
percentage points it's a pretty
remarkable<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.470> turnover<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:59.069> such<00:02:59.220> an

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
remarkable one turnover is such an

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.380 
remarkable one turnover is such an
important<00:02:59.640> play<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.209> we've

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
important play that we can we've

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
important play that we can we've
quantified<00:03:00.629> over<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.200> years<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.890> cold<00:03:02.129> hard

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
quantified over the years that cold hard

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.589 
quantified over the years that cold hard
football<00:03:02.400> facts<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.000> can't<00:03:03.209> count<00:03:03.480> on

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
football facts but you can't count on

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.880 
football facts but you can't count on
them<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.930> got<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.109> look<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.349> more<00:03:04.829> than

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
them so you got to look at more than

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.289 
them so you got to look at more than
that<00:03:05.129> but<00:03:05.280> those<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.549> three<00:03:05.640> trends<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> chala

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
that but those are three trends I chala

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.210

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
spread that's what Seattle Seahawks

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.159 
spread that's what Seattle Seahawks
Butch<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.419> that's<00:03:30.599> why<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.989> such<00:03:31.109> a

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
Butch and that's why this is such a

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.530 
Butch and that's why this is such a
great<00:03:31.349> matchup<00:03:31.760> 13<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.910> 6<00:03:33.150> against<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
great matchup 13 and 6 against the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.849 
great matchup 13 and 6 against the
spread<00:03:33.780> at<00:03:33.930> home<00:03:34.079> under<00:03:34.290> Pete<00:03:34.500> Carroll<00:03:34.799> you

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
spread at home under Pete Carroll you

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.490 
spread at home under Pete Carroll you
know<00:03:34.950> almost<00:03:35.220> seventy<00:03:35.549> percent<00:03:36.169> on<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.319> road

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
know almost seventy percent on the road

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.240 
know almost seventy percent on the road
yeah<00:03:37.709> granted<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.250> much<00:03:38.400> smaller<00:03:38.959> sample<00:03:39.959> here

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
yeah granted a much smaller sample here

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.650 
yeah granted a much smaller sample here
so<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.310> know<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.669> is<00:03:41.699> a<00:03:41.819> team<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.299> 19

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
so you know this is a team that it's 19

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.479 
so you know this is a team that it's 19
games<00:03:42.900> carry<00:03:43.169> it's<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.410> four<00:03:43.739> games<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
games carry it's not four games well the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.400 
games carry it's not four games well the
bigger<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.090> bigger<00:03:45.329> sample<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.290> look

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
bigger the bigger sample is if you look

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.280 
bigger the bigger sample is if you look
historically<00:03:46.620> since<00:03:47.459> even<00:03:47.819> since<00:03:48.090> 2000<00:03:48.750> no

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
historically since even since 2000 no

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.629 
historically since even since 2000 no
team<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.739> better<00:03:49.919> on<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.220> road<00:03:50.370> against<00:03:50.579> the

team is better on the road against the

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.580 
team is better on the road against the
spread<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:50.910> worse<00:03:51.180> I've<00:03:51.510> been<00:03:52.230> better<00:03:52.379> at

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
spread and worse I've been better at

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.869 
spread and worse I've been better at
home<00:03:52.799> against<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.190> spread<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.519> worse<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.670 
home against the spread and worse on the
road<00:03:54.060> see<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:54.810> wins<00:03:55.079> about<00:03:55.290> thirty<00:03:55.530> eight

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
road see I don't wins about thirty eight

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.009 
road see I don't wins about thirty eight
percent<00:03:55.709> against<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> spread<00:03:56.639> on<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.780> road

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
percent against the spread on the road

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.599 
percent against the spread on the road
and<00:03:58.319> they're<00:03:58.620> about<00:03:58.769> sixty<00:03:59.370> four<00:03:59.579> percent

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
and they're about sixty four percent

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.629 
and they're about sixty four percent
since<00:04:00.209> 2000<00:04:00.900> against<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.919> spread<00:04:02.099> at<00:04:02.250> home<00:04:02.430> so

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
since 2000 against the spread at home so

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.610 
since 2000 against the spread at home so
with<00:04:02.730> two<00:04:02.879> competing<00:04:03.209> forces<00:04:03.389> here<00:04:04.049> between

with two competing forces here between

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.140 
with two competing forces here between
the<00:04:04.859> Seahawks<00:04:05.280> at<00:04:05.400> their<00:04:05.549> great<00:04:05.760> home<00:04:05.940> record

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the Seahawks at their great home record

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.330 
the Seahawks at their great home record
that<00:04:06.629> 12th<00:04:06.930> man<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.290> legit<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:07.889> said<00:04:08.160> and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
that 12th man is legit as we said and

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.460 
that 12th man is legit as we said and
the<00:04:08.669> Patriots<00:04:08.849> mean<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.629> know<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.750> best<00:04:10.139> road

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
the Patriots mean you know the best road

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.229 
the Patriots mean you know the best road
team<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.680> football<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:11.310> think<00:04:11.699> one<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
