00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.980
 and the night 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.700
 I will think about it 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.189

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.189

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.990
 and nothing that we are going to the port now 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:41.110
 to tell us if they do not want 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.900
 bind and that we will continue with the park 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 Canalejas where everyone drinks 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.940

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 then we will go to canalejas 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.570
 and the most curious of cities for 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.840
 land we want you to follow many 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.840

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.030
 the day of the shore 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.850
 but of good people 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.310

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.310

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.049

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.810
 parana 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.480

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.060
 diversity 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.060
