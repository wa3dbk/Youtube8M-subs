00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.849 
good idea to silicone the brackets to
the<00:04:09.450> box<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.900> ensure<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.319> waterproof

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
the box to ensure the waterproof

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.500 
the box to ensure the waterproof
qualities<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.639> your<00:04:11.879> box

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.360 

you<00:04:17.140> need<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.470> make<00:04:17.620> one<00:04:17.860> more<00:04:18.040> set<00:04:18.250> of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
you need to make one more set of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.640 
you need to make one more set of
brackets<00:04:18.610> for<00:04:19.150> each<00:04:19.270> box<00:04:19.660> here's<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
brackets for each box here's the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.470 
brackets for each box here's the
original<00:04:20.770> size<00:04:21.190> corner<00:04:21.640> brace<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:22.030> bought<00:04:22.240> and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
original size corner brace I bought and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.110 
original size corner brace I bought and
here's<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.840> size<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.260> upgraded<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.920> because<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
here's the size I upgraded to because it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.940 
here's the size I upgraded to because it
he<00:04:25.270> had<00:04:25.390> two<00:04:25.810> holes<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.320> each<00:04:26.440> side<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.890> the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
he had two holes in each side of the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.130 
he had two holes in each side of the
bracket<00:04:27.190> for<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.580> more<00:04:27.700> secure<00:04:28.090> mount<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:29.020> the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
bracket for a more secure mount to the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.410 
bracket for a more secure mount to the
box<00:04:29.380> they'll<00:04:30.220> end<00:04:30.370> up<00:04:30.520> looking<00:04:31.030> like<00:04:31.060> this

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
box they'll end up looking like this

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.060 
box they'll end up looking like this
once<00:04:31.690> they're<00:04:31.930> bent<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.350> when<00:04:32.920> they're

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
once they're bent and when they're

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.560 
once they're bent and when they're
mounted<00:04:33.400> on<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.640> box<00:04:33.880> they'll<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.360> in<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
mounted on the box they'll be in the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.870 
mounted on the box they'll be in the
position<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.920> can<00:04:36.040> see<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.460> box<00:04:36.670> on

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
position that you can see in the box on

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.750 
position that you can see in the box on
the<00:04:37.030> right<00:04:37.240> here<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:38.310> what<00:04:39.310> they<00:04:39.430> are<00:04:39.520> going

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
the right here and what they are going

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.760 
the right here and what they are going
to<00:04:39.850> do<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.240> make<00:04:40.450> your<00:04:40.600> box<00:04:40.780> much<00:04:41.080> more<00:04:41.290> secure

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
to do is make your box much more secure

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.140 
to do is make your box much more secure
to<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.070> bike<00:04:42.250> rack<00:04:42.280> they'll<00:04:42.880> be<00:04:42.970> less

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
to the bike rack they'll be less

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.270 
to the bike rack they'll be less
rattling<00:04:43.690> around<00:04:43.810> it'll<00:04:44.740> prevent<00:04:45.040> someone

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
rattling around it'll prevent someone

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.550 
rattling around it'll prevent someone
from<00:04:45.400> just<00:04:45.760> coming<00:04:45.970> along<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.660> yanking<00:04:47.410> and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
from just coming along and yanking and

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560 
from just coming along and yanking and
twisting<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> box<00:04:48.310> up<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.760> walking<00:04:49.480> away

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
twisting the box up and walking away

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.130 
twisting the box up and walking away
with<00:04:49.870> it

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
with it

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.280 
with it
so<00:04:50.740> it's<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:52.150> an<00:04:52.390> important<00:04:52.840> part<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.170> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
so it's really an important part of the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.840 
so it's really an important part of the
assembly<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.980> you're<00:04:54.220> going<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.430> ever<00:04:54.550> be

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
assembly if you're going to ever be

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.160 
assembly if you're going to ever be
leaving<00:04:55.210> any<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.420> these<00:04:55.570> mounted<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.110> your

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
leaving any of these mounted to your

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:05.070 
leaving any of these mounted to your
bike<00:05:00.540> now<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:02.050> did<00:05:02.860> manage<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.720> still<00:05:04.720> use<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
bike now I did manage to still use the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.570 
bike now I did manage to still use the
trays<00:05:05.380> even<00:05:05.710> though<00:05:05.800> you'll<00:05:05.950> see<00:05:06.190> here<00:05:06.430> they

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
trays even though you'll see here they

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.640 
trays even though you'll see here they
actually<00:05:06.940> had<00:05:07.150> some<00:05:07.540> slots<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.200> can<00:05:08.260> see<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
actually had some slots you can see the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.740 
actually had some slots you can see the
nuts<00:05:09.400> sticking<00:05:10.000> through<00:05:10.150> under<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> tray

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
nuts sticking through under the tray

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.780 
nuts sticking through under the tray
just<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.320> bit<00:05:11.500> there<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.550> makes<00:05:12.700> it

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
just a little bit there and it makes it

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.890 
just a little bit there and it makes it
a<00:05:12.820> little<00:05:12.880> more<00:05:13.030> secure<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.450> air<00:05:13.600> but<00:05:13.810> you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
a little more secure in air but you

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.420 
a little more secure in air but you
would<00:05:14.020> want<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.290> keep<00:05:14.380> small<00:05:14.710> items<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.310> at

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
would want to keep small items in it at

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.560 
would want to keep small items in it at
that<00:05:15.580> point<00:05:15.880> because<00:05:16.120> they<00:05:16.240> could<00:05:16.360> fall

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
that point because they could fall

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.450 
that point because they could fall
through<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:19.150> now<00:05:19.770> making<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:21.040> whole<00:05:21.190> thing

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
through and now making the whole thing

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.320 
through and now making the whole thing
lockable<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.360> bike<00:05:23.160> here<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:24.730> can<00:05:24.910> see<00:05:25.120> the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
lockable to the bike here we can see the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.600 
lockable to the bike here we can see the

is in place the the boxes once they're
done<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:34.960> did<00:05:35.320> mount<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.740> couple<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.160> reflectors

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
done I did mount a couple of reflectors

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.030 
done I did mount a couple of reflectors
on<00:05:36.850> them<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.240> make<00:05:37.720> myself<00:05:37.960> more<00:05:38.200> visible<00:05:38.770> and

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
on them to make myself more visible and

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.390 
on them to make myself more visible and
recommend<00:05:39.910> anybody<00:05:40.120> else<00:05:40.450> would<00:05:40.630> do<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.870> same

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
recommend anybody else would do the same

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.090 
recommend anybody else would do the same
but<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:43.410> did<00:05:44.410> with<00:05:44.530> some<00:05:44.770> slight

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
but the did with some slight

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.880 
but the did with some slight
modification<00:05:46.030> aka<00:05:46.660> bending<00:05:47.440> of<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.620> bike

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
modification aka bending of the bike

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.710 
modification aka bending of the bike
rack<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:48.400> was<00:05:48.520> able<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.910> get<00:05:49.030> this<00:05:49.180> bike<00:05:49.450> lock

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
rack it was able to get this bike lock

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.220 
rack it was able to get this bike lock
through<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.950> spring-loaded<00:05:51.400> arm<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:52.230> you

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
through the spring-loaded arm and you

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.590 
through the spring-loaded arm and you
can't<00:05:53.560> lift<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:53.980> at<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.280> point<00:05:54.640> once<00:05:55.510> the

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
can't lift it at that point once the

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.020 
can't lift it at that point once the
lock<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:56.020> in<00:05:56.170> place<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:57.340> this<00:05:57.580> is<00:05:57.760> really

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
lock is in place so this is really

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.270 
lock is in place so this is really
awesome<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.600> lock<00:05:58.750> comes<00:05:58.990> off<00:05:59.280> quite

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
awesome and the lock comes off quite

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.840
