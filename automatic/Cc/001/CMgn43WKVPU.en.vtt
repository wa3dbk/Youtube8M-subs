Kenny said Team ethics vollis was
spectacular<00:01:49.259> didn't<00:01:50.259> have<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.470> do<00:01:50.619> much<00:01:50.829> work

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
spectacular didn't have to do much work

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.520 
spectacular didn't have to do much work
because<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.600> reach<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> racket<00:01:53.439> was

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
because the reach of the racket was

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.460 
because the reach of the racket was
spectacular<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.720> also<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.780> could<00:01:55.930> have<00:01:56.080> had

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
spectacular and also it could have had

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.130 
spectacular and also it could have had
to<00:01:56.619> do<00:01:56.799> maybe<00:01:57.070> because<00:01:57.340> my<00:01:57.490> arms<00:01:57.789> along<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.479> felt

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
to do maybe because my arms along I felt

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.219 
to do maybe because my arms along I felt
solid<00:01:59.470> my<00:01:59.950> volleys<00:02:00.369> were<00:02:00.549> compact<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.990> was

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
solid my volleys were compact it was

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.910 
solid my volleys were compact it was
tight<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.890> great<00:02:03.220> touch<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.509> feel<00:02:05.259> as<00:02:05.409> if<00:02:05.439> any

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
tight a great touch and I feel as if any

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.040 
tight a great touch and I feel as if any
one<00:02:06.310> player<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:06.640> uses<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.330> racket<00:02:07.810> would

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
one player that uses the racket would

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.020 
one player that uses the racket would
really<00:02:08.319> like<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:08.979> stronger<00:02:09.789> players

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
really like it and stronger players

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.800 
really like it and stronger players
would<00:02:10.239> love<00:02:10.420> it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
would love it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
would love it
intermediate<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.709> feel<00:02:11.980> as<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.910> was<00:02:13.150> an

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
intermediate and I feel as this was an

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.180 
intermediate and I feel as this was an
all-around<00:02:13.510> stick<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:14.200> me<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:15.010> anyone

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
all-around stick for me and for anyone

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
all-around stick for me and for anyone
else<00:02:15.459> who<00:02:15.580> would<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.849> use<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.770 

I<00:03:00.890> felt<00:03:01.890> serving<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.610> racket<00:03:02.850> also<00:03:03.540> had

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
I felt serving with this racket also had

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
I felt serving with this racket also had
a<00:03:03.810> tendency<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.560> wobble<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> hand<00:03:05.550> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a tendency to wobble in the hand a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.110 
a tendency to wobble in the hand a
little<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.980> don't<00:03:08.160> think<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.820> advanced

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
little and so I don't think the advanced

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.420 
little and so I don't think the advanced
players<00:03:09.450> will<00:03:09.750> necessarily<00:03:09.990> like<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.590> from<00:03:11.250> my

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
players will necessarily like it from my

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.300 
players will necessarily like it from my
perspective<00:03:11.900> however<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.560> they<00:03:13.860> choose<00:03:14.130> us<00:03:14.160> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
perspective however if they choose us to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.680 
perspective however if they choose us to
use<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.850> because<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.180> such<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> great

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
use it because it's such a great

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.470 
use it because it's such a great
all-around<00:03:15.960> frame<00:03:16.620> they<00:03:17.400> could<00:03:17.640> maybe<00:03:17.880> use

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
all-around frame they could maybe use

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.220 
all-around frame they could maybe use
some<00:03:18.930> LED<00:03:19.500> tape<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.910> balance<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.540> head<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
some LED tape to balance the head out a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.080 
some LED tape to balance the head out a
little<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.710> but<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.950> felt<00:03:23.310> he<00:03:23.430> had<00:03:23.460> good<00:03:23.730> sip

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
little more but I felt he had good sip

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.190 
little more but I felt he had good sip
and<00:03:24.590> good<00:03:25.590> energy<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.030> stroke<00:03:27.390> was<00:03:27.750> very

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and good energy and the stroke was very

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.180 
and good energy and the stroke was very
solid<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.830> it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
solid with it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.580 
solid with it
certainly
