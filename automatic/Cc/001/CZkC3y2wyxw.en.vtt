00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
anyway so he he creates the device he

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.710 
anyway so he he creates the device he
completes<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.580> then<00:02:19.700> he<00:02:19.879> activates<00:02:20.510> it

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
completes it and then he activates it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.559 
completes it and then he activates it
and<00:02:20.750> he<00:02:21.019> traps<00:02:21.440> Gersh<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.159> so<00:02:22.400> he<00:02:23.030> lets<00:02:23.269> into

Takeo and Tang Dempsey somehow reach an
abandoned<00:02:49.010> soviet<00:02:50.049> cosmodrome<00:02:51.049> which<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
abandoned soviet cosmodrome which is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.220 
abandoned soviet cosmodrome which is
basically<00:02:52.239> ascension<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.390> they<00:02:53.510> reach<00:02:53.959> this

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
basically ascension so they reach this

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.069 
basically ascension so they reach this
map<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.190> characters<00:02:55.640> then<00:02:55.849> here<00:02:56.120> Gersh<00:02:56.450> who

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
map the characters then here Gersh who

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.690 
map the characters then here Gersh who
tells<00:02:57.349> them<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.859> mechanism<00:02:58.400> must<00:02:58.549> be

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
tells them that the mechanism must be

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.280 
tells them that the mechanism must be
repaired<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.269> he's<00:02:59.480> referring<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.109> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
repaired and he's referring to the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.770 
repaired and he's referring to the
Kasmir<00:03:00.890> mechanism<00:03:01.489> which<00:03:02.120> must<00:03:02.329> be<00:03:02.450> repaired

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
Kasmir mechanism which must be repaired

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.140 
Kasmir mechanism which must be repaired
by<00:03:03.019> completing<00:03:03.470> different<00:03:03.680> tasks<00:03:04.310> after<00:03:04.970> all

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
by completing different tasks after all

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.940 
by completing different tasks after all
the<00:03:05.359> tests<00:03:05.659> are<00:03:05.720> completed<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.349> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the tests are completed and the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.539 
the tests are completed and the
mechanism<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.549> repaired<00:03:07.970> gurcius<00:03:08.510> freed<00:03:08.840> so

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
mechanism is repaired gurcius freed so

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.920 
mechanism is repaired gurcius freed so
this<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> easter<00:03:11.269> egg<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.629> could<00:03:11.810> do

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this is a easter egg that you could do

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.479 
this is a easter egg that you could do
on<00:03:11.959> ascension<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.739> if<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:12.920> guys<00:03:13.010> completed

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
on ascension and if you guys completed

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.910 
on ascension and if you guys completed
it<00:03:13.609> Gersh<00:03:14.090> would<00:03:14.359> be<00:03:14.480> free<00:03:14.750> while<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> events

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
it Gersh would be free while the events

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.470 
it Gersh would be free while the events
of<00:03:16.040> ascension<00:03:16.459> are<00:03:16.549> occurring<00:03:16.849> in<00:03:16.940> russia<00:03:17.180> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
of ascension are occurring in russia the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.270 
of ascension are occurring in russia the
events<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.959> five<00:03:18.200> are<00:03:18.379> also<00:03:18.500> unfolding<00:03:19.099> in<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
pentagon a piece of Intel reveals that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.289 
pentagon a piece of Intel reveals that
all<00:03:21.739> Wunderwaffe<00:03:22.310> materials<00:03:22.849> were<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.209> be

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
all Wunderwaffe materials were to be

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.520 
all Wunderwaffe materials were to be
moved<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.630> American<00:03:24.169> controlled

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
moved to American controlled

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.309 
moved to American controlled
installations<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.630> all<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.900> Wunderwaffe

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
installations so all the Wunderwaffe
