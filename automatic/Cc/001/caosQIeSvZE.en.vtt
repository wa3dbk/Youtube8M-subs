00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:06.379
 video tutorial I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:11.420
 to be able to format our netbook 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.610
 government and install windows 7 elite 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 well basically as you know the 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.060
 government law does not have 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.460
 readers / so everything is done through 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 fourth usb good first thing we have 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.029
 what to do is insert our usb port 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.960
 once we have inserted it we must 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.960
 format what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.150
 mine is formatted so I can 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.590
 do it in this vacuum 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.010
 good 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 once we have formatted it we are going 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 to download 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.559
 the program / did 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.270
 in description I told him a video to 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.540
 can download 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.480
 good once it has been downloaded 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.940
 they will go to file open and they will 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.240
 select your iso image in my case yo 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.080
 I have windows 7 windows 7 process that 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 the common that heavy as 32 gigas and a 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.350
 lite version that weighs 663 megabytes 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.650
 good elite means to get them out 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.780
 programs take away things so that they weigh 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.830
 less and since he claimed the government 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.040
 has a gig of ram is this windows 7 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 elite send very well in her good the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.399
 we select and we will open 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 these are all the files that 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.750
 they are going to decompress you can say 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 Well, if we want, we'll change the name 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.360
 in my case I'll leave it so good to observe 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.990
 which says self-starting 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.350
