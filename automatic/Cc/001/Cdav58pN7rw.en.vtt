00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.919
 [Music] 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 hi people are blue tiziano are here 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.030
 for a series intervenes that will treat 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 of the best fashions for minecraft in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.759
 this first episode we will cover 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.680
 exclusively so that they go to 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.619
 change the graphical point of view e 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:27.900
 functional the first mode we should 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.609
 to treat is the mit lights line was 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 created by tomic stryker and as the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 name take dynamic lights this fashion 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.880
 adds some double glitters with the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.260
 minecraft lighting system 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 when holding an object like 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 a torch a glaston or whatever else 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.840
 illuminates the surrounding area 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 in the same way the object is thrown in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 question will continue to illuminate the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.390
 area is not a very heavy fashion then 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.739
 even computers and a little more dated 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.739
 will be able to support it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 the second bike that we will see to deal with e 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.640
 the dynamic shadow was created by 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.620
 sorice tech that really made a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 great work this fashion are added 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 dynamic shadows that are not only 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.690
 improve graphically but change 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.700
 also position depending on the time of 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.650
 day while the light source is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 sure many of you have seen 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 videos and wallpapers of minecraft made with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 3ds max and 4d cinema where they bloom 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 incredible suggestive shadows that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.650
 they look like high quality games like 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.330
 battlefield 3 and crisis this fashion does not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.979
 adds as many polygons as the two 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.450
 games that I just stated but 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.399
 however we approach without too many 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.899
 problems to make this fashion run 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.399
 without too many problems 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.140
 you need a computer 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.399
 medium to high performance for not having 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.399
 excessive drops in fps 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.110
 the third bike I want to show you 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.120
 of the smart moving that is my mode 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.319
 preferred is not for its own effects in the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.880
 game but adds anyway 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.140
 amazing features that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.510
 they should be in the default game 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 fashion smat booming from your character 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.069
 additional features such as being able to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.620
 climb the crawl the swim it 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.180
 sprint and animation for the flight knows 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.220
 the sprint has already been added to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.750
 beta of minecraft 1.8 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.730
 and that's why I'm confident 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.380
 some of these are the features 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.620
 will be added in future updates of 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.620
 minecraft 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.940
 the fourth wife more I will go to 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.950
 illustrate will be left harmont water 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.300
 this fashion chen of the surfaces of the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.640
 water blocks in a replica 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.780
 realistic real water complete in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.390
 real time water reflections 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.430
 superficial disturbances and more 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.930
 this fashion greatly increases the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.540
 water realism making it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.280
 reflective and flowing to make oneself 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.670
 I think how amazing this is 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.920
 fashion 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.920
 you have to install it try it 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.560
 if you also think that minecraft is 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.780
 this mode is too little violent 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.030
 your solution the fifth and last fashion 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 is the blog mode that is as simple as 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.990
 it looks like when you hit a mob 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.250
 red particles come out that 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.200
 they represent the blood 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.120
 I personally love this fashion 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.860
 because it adds that touch of splatter 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 which is a bit everyone likes this 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.700
 characteristic had to be of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.340
 default in the game but for some 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.750
 complaints has never been implemented 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.070
 so now you decide if 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.290
 you want a little more free violence 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.300
 also minecraft obviously fashion is 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.130
 therefore very light also computer and a 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.750
 older they will be able to support it 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.750
 without major drops in fps 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.590
 for this video is the whole entrance to 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.570
 generally the possibility of being able to upload 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.840
 one of my videos on their channel 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.010
 invitation to vote to comment and if there is 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.490
 liked the video to pass on my 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.470
 channel 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.420
 if you would like to register for this 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.420
