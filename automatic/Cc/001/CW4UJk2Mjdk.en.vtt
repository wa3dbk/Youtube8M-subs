another client as a group message so a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
another client as a group message so a
client<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.960> mine<00:00:26.689> customer<00:00:27.689> said<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
can't see their text and then I guess we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.459 
can't see their text and then I guess we
were<00:00:33.090> trying<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> exchange<00:00:33.600> pictures<00:00:34.170> and

were trying to exchange pictures and
stuff<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.700> come<00:00:35.969> through<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.590> so

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
stuff like that can come through and so

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530

done this but I thought it was kind of I
it's<00:00:55.050> set<00:00:56.510> mm/s<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.260> I'm<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.500> sure<00:00:58.620> if<00:00:58.770> that's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it's set mm/s so I'm not sure if that's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's set mm/s so I'm not sure if that's
a<00:00:59.340> difference<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.359> something<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.199> yeah<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
a difference or something but yeah in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.880 
a difference or something but yeah in
the<00:01:02.399> group<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.629> his<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.589> might<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the group I don't see his it might be

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
the group I don't see his it might be
different<00:01:05.670> carrier<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.270> something<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.960> has

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
different carrier or something that has

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
different carrier or something that has
that<00:01:07.470> issue<00:01:07.729> but<00:01:08.729> um<00:01:09.330> yeah<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> thought<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that issue but um yeah I thought that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
that issue but um yeah I thought that
was<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> interesting<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.850> sure

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
was kind of interesting I'm not sure

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.359 
was kind of interesting I'm not sure
being<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.420> guys<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:12.810> had<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.260> issue

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.310 

but<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:19.670> bring<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
but I want to bring this up because I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490 
but I want to bring this up because I
wanted<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> address<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.320> thought

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
wanted to address this because I thought

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
wanted to address this because I thought
it<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> odd<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.909> were<00:01:27.150> able

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it was kind of odd and if you were able

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.679 
it was kind of odd and if you were able
to<00:01:27.630> fix<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.400> let<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.549> how<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.240> were<00:01:30.509> able

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you were able to fix it because that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
you were able to fix it because that
seems<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> could<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.090> an<00:01:36.240> issue<00:01:36.650> couldn't
