00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
hose and the firefighter goes from one

would lay hose from a hydrant to a fire

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.420 
would lay hose from a hydrant to a fire
and<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.470> showing<00:03:31.739> how<00:03:32.040> one

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
and this is just showing how one

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.560 
and this is just showing how one
firefighter<00:03:32.700> could<00:03:33.239> deploy<00:03:33.630> 400<00:03:34.350> feet<00:03:35.570> if

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
firefighter could deploy 400 feet if

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.400 
firefighter could deploy 400 feet if
needed<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:39.060> concludes<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.110> way<00:03:40.230> lean

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410
