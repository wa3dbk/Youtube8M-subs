00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
vacuum cleaner made it remote control

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.040 
vacuum cleaner made it remote control
try<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.470> have<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.280> new<00:00:33.460> invention<00:00:33.730> but<00:00:34.629> they

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
try to have a new invention but they

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.140 
try to have a new invention but they
went<00:00:35.230> haywire<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:35.920> started<00:00:36.430> breaking<00:00:37.000> other

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
went haywire and started breaking other

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.270 
went haywire and started breaking other
ones<00:00:37.449> and<00:00:38.410> somehow<00:00:38.620> from<00:00:38.949> having

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
ones and somehow from having

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.619 
ones and somehow from having
remote-controlled<00:00:39.850> vacuum<00:00:40.150> cleaners<00:00:40.510> I

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
remote-controlled vacuum cleaners I

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.009 
remote-controlled vacuum cleaners I
started<00:00:40.930> fighting<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:41.879> started<00:00:42.879> making

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
started fighting and started making

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.240 
started fighting and started making
parasitically<00:00:44.019> for<00:00:44.739> fighting<00:00:45.010> each<00:00:45.100> other

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
parasitically for fighting each other

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.280 
parasitically for fighting each other
that<00:00:45.550> were<00:00:45.640> remote<00:00:45.820> controlled<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.510> then<00:00:47.110> he

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
that were remote controlled and then he

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.380 
that were remote controlled and then he
decided<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.680> start<00:00:47.890> organizing<00:00:48.430> competitions

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
decided to start organizing competitions

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.770 
decided to start organizing competitions
and<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.540> think<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.809> was<00:00:49.900> that<00:00:50.080> like<00:00:50.280> Robot<00:00:51.280> Wars

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and I think I was that like Robot Wars

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530 
and I think I was that like Robot Wars
and<00:00:52.780> from<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.890> was<00:00:54.130> where<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:55.059> all<00:00:55.149> spawned

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
and from that was where it all spawned

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.440 
and from that was where it all spawned
and<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:56.500> peaked<00:00:56.800> at<00:00:57.010> about<00:00:57.210> nineteen<00:00:58.210> ninety

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
and that peaked at about nineteen ninety

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.389 
and that peaked at about nineteen ninety
five<00:00:58.629> or<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.020> after<00:00:59.680> that<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.980> had<00:01:00.160> all<00:01:00.280> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
five or so after that you had all the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.670 
five or so after that you had all the
other<00:01:00.550> splinter<00:01:00.969> groups<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:02.200> battle<00:01:02.530> bots

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
other splinter groups like battle bots

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.670 
other splinter groups like battle bots
and<00:01:02.950> bought<00:01:03.160> bosch<00:01:03.479> potentially<00:01:04.500> battle<00:01:05.500> bots

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
and bought bosch potentially battle bots

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.370 
and bought bosch potentially battle bots
made<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.070> TV<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:07.149> was<00:01:07.330> probably<00:01:08.020> most

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
made it on TV and that was probably most

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.150 
made it on TV and that was probably most
people<00:01:08.649> would<00:01:08.740> consider<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:10.920> apex<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
people would consider the apex of the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.150 
people would consider the apex of the
popularity<00:01:12.840> everybody<00:01:13.840> combat<00:01:14.289> because<00:01:14.800> it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
popularity everybody combat because it

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.950 
popularity everybody combat because it
was<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.490> public<00:01:15.789> eye<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.940> lot<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.840> was

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
was in the public eye a lot and that was

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.660 
was in the public eye a lot and that was
when<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.380> lot<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.770> current<00:01:18.039> generation<00:01:18.160> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
when a lot of the current generation of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.609 
when a lot of the current generation of
builders<00:01:18.970> got<00:01:19.270> into<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.690> by<00:01:20.050> seeing<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.350> on<00:01:20.410> TV

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
builders got into it by seeing it on TV

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.600 
builders got into it by seeing it on TV
and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.900> after<00:01:23.200> battle<00:01:23.500> bots<00:01:23.650> went<00:01:24.280> off<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
and then after battle bots went off the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.030 
and then after battle bots went off the
air<00:01:24.659> who's<00:01:25.659> still<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:26.229> good<00:01:26.710> amount<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
air who's still a good amount of

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.160 
air who's still a good amount of
interest<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:28.090> didn't<00:01:28.330> gain<00:01:28.930> as<00:01:29.049> many

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
interest but we didn't gain as many

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.469 
interest but we didn't gain as many
people<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.010> now<00:01:30.369> it's<00:01:30.610> often<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.210> all<00:01:31.330> these

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
still has potential she was the way it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.350 
still has potential she was the way it
hit<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.990> way<00:04:33.140> could<00:04:33.920> take<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.240> then<00:04:35.240> it

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
hit and the way could take it then it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.260 
hit and the way could take it then it
caught<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.520> ultimately<00:04:37.520> ultimately<00:04:37.910> is

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
those two but somehow they come together

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.540
