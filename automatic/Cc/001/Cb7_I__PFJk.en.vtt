00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello how about youtube friends again 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.640
 video in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.810
 how to remove the protection against 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.490
 writing device 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 storage and so a pendrive e 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 even this same good hard drive here 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 we have a device as we can see 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.389
 if we add a file where the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.440
 control zapotillo disk 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.360
 I will try new maicon 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.010
 it does not even allow us to perform 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.789
 what is formatting to the device we give 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 start and tell us 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.140
 the disc is rotten when the writing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.029
 It was good 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.590
 how we fix this is very simple 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.150
 good 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.990
 let's go here the beginning we put 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.990
 executed 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 here we are going to highlight 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.769
 we give in accepting what is the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.859
 record we give in itself after that they are 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.879
 16 local machine then attend test 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.329
 control set 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.879
 001 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.680
 the control and we're going to dispute a code 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.560
 this what you owe 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.390
 and device policies once 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 that we enter here we go to where it says 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.500
 bright protection we give right click and 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.770
 we give in modify here we will find 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.439
 the one instead of one we're going to put zero 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.719
 and we accept it once we do 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.039
 this the device must be free of 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.990
 the write protection but 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.460
 first we want to listen to the disc 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.460
 and connect it again 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.120
 add a file check see 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.260
 any type of file protection 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.260
 against locates we have been removed 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 Now I will show you another way to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 how to access protection when the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 next form consists of the following 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.350
 use an application that you downloaded 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.359
 here that is very useful is to remove the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.679
 good writing protection 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.380
 connected another device that is 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.700
 protected against writing here we have 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.189
 as we can see if we add a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.780
 file tells us equally ready is 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.049
 rotten against writing try the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.049
 new 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.129
 we put you cancel 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.180
 how the application works 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.930
 in the description of the video 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.930
 well we started 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.760
 we reconnect it again 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.760
 how 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.960
 we will see some file 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.770
 the file is copy us correctly already 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.140
 we get the message that the disk is 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.010
 protected against writing we put it 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.590
 as we can see 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.959
 the protection against situations like 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.760
 I told them in English to take off 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.810
 this will leave you in description of the video 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.329
 so you can download the application 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.099
 it will be very useful to you, that has been all 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.640
 friends until the next tutorial and 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.640
 I hope you serve them
