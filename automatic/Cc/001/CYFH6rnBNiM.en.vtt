00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
do believe so am i think the top three

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.190 
do believe so am i think the top three
this<00:02:47.489> season<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.150> gonna<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.750> no<00:02:48.989> particular

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
this season is gonna in no particular

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.370 
this season is gonna in no particular
order<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.520> us<00:02:50.760> denial<00:02:51.750> wickets

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
order it's going to be us denial wickets

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.880 
order it's going to be us denial wickets
theme<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.510> probably<00:02:54.510> Dignitas<00:02:55.080> if<00:02:55.440> they

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
theme and probably Dignitas if they

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.130 
theme and probably Dignitas if they
qualify<00:02:58.610> yeah<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.910> think<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> us<00:03:00.930> are

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
qualify yeah I think all of us are

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.009 
qualify yeah I think all of us are
pretty<00:03:01.470> strong<00:03:01.709> teams<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.019> strongly

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
pretty strong teams but I strongly

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.640 
pretty strong teams but I strongly
believe<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.769> be<00:03:04.920> us<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:07.410> we

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
believe it can be us and I think that we

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
believe it can be us and I think that we
can<00:03:07.800> go<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.010> LCS<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:09.600> not<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:11.340> not<00:03:11.670> directly

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
can go to LCS if not in if not directly

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.630 
can go to LCS if not in if not directly
through<00:03:12.570> like<00:03:13.110> first<00:03:13.380> place<00:03:13.650> then<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.130> believe

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
through like first place then I believe

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.250 
through like first place then I believe
we<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.060> through<00:03:15.350> relegations<00:03:16.350> as<00:03:16.560> well

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
we can do through relegations as well

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.600 
we can do through relegations as well
let's<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.530> look<00:03:19.560> ah<00:03:21.739> nearly<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.160> Archie

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
let's have a look ah nearly for Archie

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.780 
let's have a look ah nearly for Archie
so<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.090> i<00:03:24.209> pronounce<00:03:24.540> your<00:03:24.690> name<00:03:24.750> wrong<00:03:25.670> do<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
so if i pronounce your name wrong do you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.090 
so if i pronounce your name wrong do you
think<00:03:27.030> SK<00:03:27.360> gaming<00:03:27.540> made<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> right<00:03:28.560> decision

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
think SK gaming made the right decision

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
think SK gaming made the right decision
also<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:30.360> jesse's<00:03:30.810> about<00:03:31.140> 80<00:03:31.350> carry<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.860> mid

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
also it's jesse's about 80 carry the mid

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.660 
also it's jesse's about 80 carry the mid
so<00:03:33.120> do<00:03:33.989> i<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.380> sk<00:03:34.680> make<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.980> right<00:03:35.190> decision

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
so do i think sk make the right decision

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.090 
so do i think sk make the right decision
well<00:03:35.880> no<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:37.049> really<00:03:37.110> otherwise<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.920> would

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
well no not really otherwise I would

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.430 
well no not really otherwise I would
have<00:03:38.130> stayed<00:03:38.489> with<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:40.320> team<00:03:40.640> because<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:42.440> had

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
have stayed with the team because I had

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110 
have stayed with the team because I had
some<00:03:43.860> kind<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.190> vision<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> team<00:03:44.910> and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
some kind of vision for the team and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.550 
some kind of vision for the team and
they<00:03:45.480> didn't<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.989> i<00:03:46.140> said<00:03:46.320> before<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:48.230> yeah<00:03:49.230> i

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
they didn't like i said before so yeah i

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.000 
they didn't like i said before so yeah i
don't<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.970> they<00:03:51.090> made<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.269> right<00:03:51.390> decision

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
don't think they made the right decision

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610 
don't think they made the right decision
but<00:03:53.010> i<00:03:53.070> do<00:03:53.220> hope<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.329> do<00:03:54.390> like<00:03:55.140> well

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
but i do hope that they do like well

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.170 
but i do hope that they do like well
this<00:03:55.829> season<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.370> make<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.670> towards<00:03:56.910> because

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
this season and make it towards because

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.539 
this season and make it towards because
i<00:03:57.480> didn't<00:03:57.930> leave<00:03:58.110> with<00:03:58.950> bad<00:03:59.190> blood<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.790> all<00:04:01.549> and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
i didn't leave with bad blood at all and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.449 
i didn't leave with bad blood at all and
it's<00:04:03.299> jesse's<00:04:03.720> better<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.440> website<00:04:05.250> is

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
it's jesse's better as a website is

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.150 
it's jesse's better as a website is
jess's<00:04:05.880> about<00:04:06.269> 80<00:04:06.510> caravan<00:04:07.049> mid<00:04:07.290> yeah<00:04:07.950> he

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
jess's about 80 caravan mid yeah he

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.699 
jess's about 80 caravan mid yeah he
definitely<00:04:08.579> as<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.180> always<00:04:09.780> felt<00:04:10.079> at<00:04:10.320> midlane

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
definitely as I always felt at midlane

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.150 
definitely as I always felt at midlane
he<00:04:11.160> looked<00:04:11.430> kind<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:12.060> out<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.900> his<00:04:13.709> comfort

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
he looked kind of out of his comfort

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.840 
he looked kind of out of his comfort
zone<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.609> bit<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:16.100> he<00:04:17.100> actually<00:04:17.220> played<00:04:17.640> ad

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
zone a bit but he actually played ad

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
zone a bit but he actually played ad
carry<00:04:18.229> before<00:04:19.229> going<00:04:19.440> into<00:04:19.709> sk<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.570> i

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
carry before going into sk so i

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.969 
carry before going into sk so i
definitely<00:04:22.169> think<00:04:22.530> he's<00:04:22.770> way<00:04:22.950> more

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
definitely think he's way more

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.680 
definitely think he's way more
comfortable<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.789> role<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.240> he

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
comfortable in the role and he

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.300 
comfortable in the role and he
so<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:26.810> would<00:04:27.810> say<00:04:27.960> he's<00:04:28.140> past<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.680> his<00:04:29.070> old

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so I would say he's past is his old

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.900 
so I would say he's past is his old
skill<00:04:30.180> level<00:04:30.480> at<00:04:30.720> ad<00:04:31.020> carry<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.220> still

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
skill level at ad carry but I still

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.460 
skill level at ad carry but I still
think<00:04:33.090> he<00:04:33.180> has<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> lot<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.540> potential<00:04:33.960> because

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
think he has a lot of potential because

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.170 
think he has a lot of potential because
he's<00:04:34.680> kind<00:04:34.920> of<00:04:34.980> new<00:04:35.130> into<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.490> role<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.880> mean

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
he's kind of new into the role I mean

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.530 
he's kind of new into the role I mean
look<00:04:36.900> at<00:04:37.050> yellow<00:04:37.890> star<00:04:38.220> for<00:04:38.430> example<00:04:38.940> he<00:04:39.240> kind

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
look at yellow star for example he kind

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.390 
look at yellow star for example he kind
of<00:04:41.090> swapped<00:04:42.090> roles<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:43.170> was<00:04:43.320> more<00:04:43.920> natural

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
of swapped roles and it was more natural

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.370 
of swapped roles and it was more natural
for<00:04:44.580> him<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.850> be<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.750> role<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.260> he

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
for him to be in that role so he

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.120 
for him to be in that role so he
excelled<00:04:46.740> further<00:04:47.040> in<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:48.740> Jesse<00:04:49.740> can<00:04:49.980> do

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
excelled further in it so I Jesse can do

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.290 
excelled further in it so I Jesse can do
really<00:04:50.340> well<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.760> ATF<00:04:51.450> like<00:04:51.840> at<00:04:52.050> ad<00:04:52.260> carry<00:04:52.560> and

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
really well in ATF like at ad carry and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.030 
really well in ATF like at ad carry and
yeah<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.330> do<00:04:54.540> think<00:04:54.960> he's<00:04:55.110> one<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.560> top<00:04:55.830> ad

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
yeah I do think he's one of the top ad

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.880 
yeah I do think he's one of the top ad
carries<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.550> challenger<00:04:56.940> at<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.120> moment<00:04:57.890> on
