00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.599
 hello guys with you to the river and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.610
 Today I will show you one mod for 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 minecraft which I would not call 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 especially useful but still it is interesting 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.150
 you all know what minecraft is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 chicken eggs and a wide variety in 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 their use except to throw them not 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 the author of the mod noticed and decided to do 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.849
 several new recipes for chicken eggs 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.769
 but unfortunately this is not a recipe and everyones 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.929
 snacks like cake or pumpkin 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 pie but all the recipes you added 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 Now you can see the screen well, 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 let's order the first thing this 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 miner egg well, not the same in general 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.300
 an egg that will help you quickly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 to mine it is crafted by 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 stone pickaxe and chicken eggs 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.500
 how does it work you take it in hand 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
 press the right mouse button and stone 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 pickaxe flies in the direction in which you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.039
 looked then she cuts through several 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.230
 blocks and disappears honestly i'm not 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.760
 I know why this might be useful if 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.250
 do you have any thoughts on this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.989
 then write about it in the comments why 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 I think that it is useless because 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.430
 It is disposable, that is, if I were not 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 in 3 mode I would just throw it and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 she disappeared and more and more I would not have her 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.610
 was the next egg that was crafted 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 in this way for him 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 need one egg 5 torches one 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 chest stove and workbench use this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 the egg is best of course on level 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 terrain because if you throw it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.619
 somewhere in the mountains this building can 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 half be in a mountain house 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 represents such 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.810
 small wooden building 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 which has a door which for some reason 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 fell inside you can find those 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.070
 chest workbench and stove which 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 used for crafting and two torches 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.880
 the chest is of course an empty stove too 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.829
 the only thing you get here on 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.540
 freebie is a bunch of boards but from 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.460
 next egg I really will 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.619
 feel good because it's an egg 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.479
 for teleportation , she crafts like you 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.500
 see using the pearl endermen and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.540
 ordinary egg 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.430
 so what's its use when you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.810
 use ordinary endermen pearl 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.600
 you apply a certain amount 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.130
 damage but if you will use 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.049
 pearl through the egg you will not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.849
 damage is the only negative 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.709
 speed because when you just 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.940
 throw pearly she flies with big 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.010
 speed but if you throw 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.680
 it flies at low speed but 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.120
 you teleport without injury next 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 testicle is crafting in this way 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.970
 it will need 3 spider eyes 3 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.310
 rotten flesh two bones and one egg and you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.530
 get here's an egg to call 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.390
 monsters when you throw this egg on 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.440
 the spot of the fall of this egg will fall asleep 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.450
 several mobs 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.720
 and to be precise that 2 spider two 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.610
 skeleton 2 zombies and 4 creeper it can 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.900
 be useful for example for pumping something 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.910
 is if you need a certain 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.710
 amount of experience you have in the chests 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.690
 surely that's like a bunch of lying 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.180
 items you can craft this testicle 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.580
 throw it and fill with these mobs experience and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.100
 here are the next four eggs will be very 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 even interesting are explosive eggs 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.090
 which have the function of grenades viz . 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.430
 This is such a dynamite that you can throw 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 but why are there 4 of them but because 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.200
 they differ in the radius of the explosion at the first 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.140
 it's only 1 2 5 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.370
 the third 10 and the last 50 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.770
 large blast radius 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.140
 the weakest egg will make an explosion 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.670
 here is such he will blow up only 8 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.500
 exploding egg blocks with a radius of 5 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.170
 will make the explosion bigger here 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.720
 the blast will make an egg with a radius of 10 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.450
 pushed me away well and it was time 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.880
 test the most powerful egg i think 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 I have the game to be a bit buggy Well 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.680
 I'm ready to throw an egg 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.430
 as I said, the game was a little buggy and 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.800
 what can we see here such 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.319
 a huge crater from the explosion of the most powerful 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.450
 eggs I hope you enjoyed the review on
