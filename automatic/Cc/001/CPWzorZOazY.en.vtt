00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.070 
from the very beginning to take it in
any<00:00:20.650> direction<00:00:20.860> I<00:00:21.130> wanted<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.400> go<00:00:21.520> so<00:00:21.940> I<00:00:22.180> took

myself skills in cake design and then
spend<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.690> lot<00:00:25.780> of<00:00:25.810> time<00:00:25.930> mastering<00:00:26.500> quite

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
spend a lot of time mastering quite

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.680 
spend a lot of time mastering quite
traditional<00:00:26.920> techniques<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.060> it's<00:00:28.510> been<00:00:28.660> a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
traditional techniques and it's been a

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.180 
traditional techniques and it's been a
real<00:00:28.900> mixture<00:00:29.200> with<00:00:29.440> us<00:00:29.560> I<00:00:29.740> think<00:00:29.980> that's<00:00:30.070> the

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
real mixture with us I think that's the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.560 
real mixture with us I think that's the
bonus<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.610> learning<00:00:30.940> yourself<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.239> for<00:00:34.480> this

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570

both paintings in an irani London Indian
sweet<00:01:59.289> shops<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.240> strange

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
sweet shops and some of the strange

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.540 
sweet shops and some of the strange
proposed<00:02:02.440> tree<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.800> cake<00:02:03.009> shops<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:05.550> think

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
proposed tree and cake shops I think

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.650 
proposed tree and cake shops I think
there's<00:02:06.700> there<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.119> crossover<00:02:07.479> between

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
there's there is crossover between

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.990 
there's there is crossover between
baking<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.500> photography<00:02:09.070> it's<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.640> balance

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
baking in photography it's a balance

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.910 
baking in photography it's a balance
between<00:02:10.200> having<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> right<00:02:11.410> tools<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
between having the right tools and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800 
between having the right tools and
knowing<00:02:12.130> how<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> use<00:02:12.519> them<00:02:12.670> being<00:02:13.420> able<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
knowing how to use them being able to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
knowing how to use them being able to
capture<00:02:14.650> color<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:15.760> strongly<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
capture color really strongly and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.690 
capture color really strongly and
contrast<00:02:16.959> little<00:02:17.650> details<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.430> easily

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
contrast little details that can easily

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.850 
contrast little details that can easily
be<00:02:18.880> lost<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.510> think<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.350> more<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.709> more

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
be lost I think it's just more and more

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.400 
be lost I think it's just more and more
important<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:22.090> definitely<00:02:22.269> take<00:02:23.049> pictures

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
important and I definitely take pictures

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.470 
important and I definitely take pictures
every<00:02:23.530> day<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.910> know<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> drew<00:02:25.299> some

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
every day you know I drew some

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.509 
every day you know I drew some
inspiration<00:02:26.019> from<00:02:26.230> from<00:02:26.799> Tebow's<00:02:27.160> palette

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
inspiration from from Tebow's palette

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.420 
inspiration from from Tebow's palette
but<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.330> idea<00:02:28.570> was<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.989> recreate<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:30.040> setting

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
but the idea was to recreate the setting

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
but the idea was to recreate the setting
in<00:02:30.549> his<00:02:30.700> style<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.209> then<00:02:31.360> make<00:02:32.049> all<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> cakes

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
in his style but then make all the cakes

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.340 
in his style but then make all the cakes
really<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.010> my

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.050 

yeah<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.380> really<00:02:38.650> enjoyed<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.100> process<00:02:39.310> using

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
yeah I really enjoyed the process using

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180 
yeah I really enjoyed the process using
the<00:02:40.150> camera<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.690> research<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.620> develop<00:02:41.740> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the camera to research and develop the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.100 
the camera to research and develop the
idea<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.730> then<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:43.630> matching<00:02:43.990> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
idea and then and then matching that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750 
idea and then and then matching that
against<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> finished<00:02:45.280> shot<00:02:45.490> which<00:02:45.640> I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
against the finished shot which I

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.340 
against the finished shot which I
thought<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.180> strong<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:47.080> was<00:02:47.230> really

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
thought was really strong it was really

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.260 
thought was really strong it was really
fun<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.740> play<00:02:47.920> around<00:02:48.040> with<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> concept<00:02:49.150> of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
fun to play around with the concept of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.900 
fun to play around with the concept of
the<00:02:49.480> landscapes<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.200> life<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.700> look<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the landscapes to life and look at it

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.610 
the landscapes to life and look at it
from<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> different<00:02:52.150> perspective<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.930> think<00:02:52.959> we

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
from a different perspective I think we

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.040 
from a different perspective I think we
want<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.990> rework<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.520> traditional<00:02:57.520> style<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
want to rework a traditional style and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.840 
want to rework a traditional style and
bring<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> date<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.580> modern<00:03:01.540> angle
