00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.080
 show how to make this plane to the ego 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 so to build this plane we 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:22.199
 need these pieces so four pieces 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:27.720
 khalsa unite two pieces like that one 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:36.469
 piece as his piece like that of sion 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:41.640
 blue like that a piece like that then 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 not like that after the other pieces I 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.200
 can see so then to start one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.120
 will take these two pieces 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.379
 these two pieces there and we will hang 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 his pieces like that it's simple 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.730
 this is how we go 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.239
 take this piece there two of three 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 white 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 we will put it there and this plate is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 this by agent then we will take 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 this piece we'll put it there goes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 take these two pieces 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.390
 you'll put it here that's even that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.610
 then we will take this piece we will 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 put the canvas 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 here we go there after we will take a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.270
 party then this is way we will add 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.369
 the quay rockets the work for one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 others 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.140
 here and we place them at each end 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 d she then we will take full here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.689
 and we're going to do that like this then we're going 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.640
 take this plate 2 of 4 white 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.590
 if we put it there and squared sees it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.800
 there and we will add this piece in the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.890
 area that and finally we'll put 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.890
 the propeller here is the work is done
