think

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
think

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.660 
think
and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.930> also<00:00:46.140> experimented<00:00:47.070> quite<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and I also experimented quite a little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
and I also experimented quite a little
bit<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.629> creative<00:00:49.320> imaginations<00:00:50.219> lumen

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
twinks together and I made a little

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.310 
twinks together and I made a little
sheet<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.229> see

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
I did for two of my projects is that I
toned<00:02:04.350> my<00:02:04.799> paper<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.320> pearl<00:02:07.710> gold<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
toned my paper with the pearl gold and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
toned my paper with the pearl gold and
the<00:02:09.420> pewter

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.470 

so<00:02:14.620> cut<00:02:14.830> your<00:02:15.040> paper<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> correct<00:02:16.870> size<00:02:18.480> on

so cut your paper to the correct size on

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.440 
so cut your paper to the correct size on
the<00:02:19.720> cheeky<00:02:20.080> bluej<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.740> told<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.640> cut<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.240> a

the cheeky bluej I told you to cut it a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.660 
the cheeky bluej I told you to cut it a
little<00:02:22.690> bit<00:02:22.840> larger<00:02:23.380> than<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.460> want

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
little bit larger than what you want

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
because I found that the color pulled a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.100 
because I found that the color pulled a
little<00:02:27.700> bit<00:02:27.820> at<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.120> edges<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:28.930> nice

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
little bit at the edges and it was nice

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.610 
little bit at the edges and it was nice
to<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.320> able<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.590> cut<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.070> off<00:02:31.260> spray<00:02:32.260> your

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
that little tiny bit of shimmer just for

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.390 
that little tiny bit of shimmer just for
something<00:05:33.660> different<00:05:34.070> okay<00:05:35.070> so<00:05:35.130> we'll<00:05:35.370> just

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
something different okay so we'll just

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.290 
something different okay so we'll just
let<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:35.760> dry<00:05:36.770> if<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.950> curls<00:05:38.310> up<00:05:38.490> on<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:38.940> and

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
let that dry if it curls up on you and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.450 
let that dry if it curls up on you and
goes<00:05:39.930> alway<00:05:40.350> be<00:05:40.410> that's<00:05:40.800> when<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.100> can<00:05:41.280> iron

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460

goes alway be that's when you can iron
it<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.060> then<00:05:42.900> there's<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.170> super<00:05:43.590> seal<00:05:43.950> spray

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
it and then there's a super seal spray

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.330

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
more of a protection so that if

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.930 
more of a protection so that if
something<00:05:49.200> does<00:05:49.410> fall<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:49.890> it<00:05:50.250> water<00:05:50.670> wise

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
something does fall on it water wise

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.050 
something does fall on it water wise
it's<00:05:51.450> not<00:05:51.750> going<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.110> destroy<00:05:52.560> your<00:05:52.860> your<00:05:53.550> your

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
was a little rough looking so I put my

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.170 
was a little rough looking so I put my
colors<00:07:01.260> back<00:07:01.590> into<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.100> little<00:07:02.250> dishes<00:07:02.850> that

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
colors back into the little dishes that

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.550 
colors back into the little dishes that
I<00:07:03.210> had<00:07:03.510> took<00:07:04.290> my<00:07:04.500> sponge<00:07:04.950> and<00:07:05.310> re<00:07:05.820> tapped<00:07:06.560> doing

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
I had took my sponge and re tapped doing

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.280 
I had took my sponge and re tapped doing
the<00:07:07.770> key<00:07:08.340> lime<00:07:08.580> first<00:07:09.120> and<00:07:09.510> then<00:07:09.870> coming<00:07:10.260> back

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290 
the key lime first and then coming back
