 Ingredients: For soufflé: Strawberry - 390g; Starch - 20g; Egg whites - 250g (6-7); Sugar - 45g; 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.260
 For syrup: Sugar - 200g; Water - 60ml. 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:50.040
 First you need to cook the syrup, adding 45 grams of sugar and water. Cook for 15 minutes. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:03.380
 We put strawberries in a blender and turn them into mashed potatoes. H 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:24.020
 Then, in a separate bowl, dilute the starch in a small amount of cold water. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 Put the pot on the fire, pour in the strawberry puree and diluted starch. All cook for about 10 minutes. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 Beat whites with sugar until firm foam. 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.760
 In the heated strawberry puree pour syrup and mix everything well. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:25.020
 Strawberries with syrup thin stream pour in proteins 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.300
 Mix gently with a spatula so that the proteins do not sit down while not interfering for a very long time, you can use a low speed mixer. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:51.740
 Prepare the ceramic molds, grease them with butter and lightly sprinkle with sugar on top. 

00:02:51.874 --> 00:03:30.274
 Pour the soufflé on the headbands with a knife so that the souffle rises well. 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:41.020
 Sent in the oven for 9 minutes, while the oven can not be opened. 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.320
