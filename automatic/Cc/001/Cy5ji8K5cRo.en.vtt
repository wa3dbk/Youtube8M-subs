00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
so let's see if this will work the the
code<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> capital<00:01:27.750> J<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
code for that is capital J to make it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.700 
code for that is capital J to make it
disappear<00:01:28.920> magic<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.820> sort<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> its<00:01:30.689> Maj<00:01:30.960> majin

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
disappear magic or sort of its Maj majin

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.010 
disappear magic or sort of its Maj majin
buu<00:01:31.890> Dragon<00:01:32.400> Ball<00:01:32.549> Z<00:01:32.700> reference<00:01:33.090> oh<00:01:33.240> yes<00:01:33.509> on

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
buu Dragon Ball Z reference oh yes on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
buu Dragon Ball Z reference oh yes on
these<00:01:34.170> nuts<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> hop<00:01:35.460> back<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
these nuts so then you hop back in the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
these nuts so then you hop back in the
clan<00:01:36.030> tag<00:01:36.240> let's<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> worked<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
clan tag let's see if it worked I don't

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.499 
clan tag let's see if it worked I don't
think<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.579> worked<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.360> doesn't

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
think it worked this time it doesn't

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.350 
think it worked this time it doesn't
work<00:01:39.630> every<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:41.759> funky<00:01:42.150> let

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
work every time it's it's it's funky let

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.630 
work every time it's it's it's funky let
me<00:01:42.450> try<00:01:42.630> again<00:01:42.750> I'll<00:01:43.049> give<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.470> shot

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
me try again I'll give it one more shot

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.039 
me try again I'll give it one more shot
