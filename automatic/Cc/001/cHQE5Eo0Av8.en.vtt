00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.249
 t 

00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:02.210
 become behind me 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.410
 really wrong interviewed but there seems to be some other cards around 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.409
 level one that runs on a dike in volendam 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.959
 a new trend that comes to him so one then plays football on the dike 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.909
 melvin flat 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.689
 the local football club is back in the premier league 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.380
 but nothing actually changes for the band itself 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.909
 Volendam is the IJsselmeer 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.749
 the harbor the dike 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.749
 And then there are of course not always return to names 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
 painter 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
 melvin platje could very well be the full-grown person with his talent 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.240
 nevertheless the name platje in the telephone book of volendam comes exactly 0 4 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.550
 in front of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.630
 the right-legged attacker for nineteen years only comes out of the throw 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.970
 quot in bussum a few times a week goes to the former fishing village 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.760
 the Volendam football fan knows him after his debut last week in the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.810
 Premier League against Heerenveen 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.380
 but out there there are hardly any known 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.300
 and in the course of the coming 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.660
 to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 a bid of 9 more than being with a couple 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.270
 and then i was 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.090
 I think you're treated for something 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.730
 and then take it home to go from zeist and bunnik to volendam 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.660
 storyline 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.550
 you are open for hours 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.900
 rian van dam and the three weeks 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.240
 in the preparation to go the profit 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 and when we are working on it 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.020
 there is a shuttle run on the program 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 it is not really a hobby of football players but what you love 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 to walk a lot 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 mel c in them is a boy with a lot of energy 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.640
 and thereby 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.070
 the opposition unpredictable for an opponent because then a ball that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.650
 seems to be lost 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.380
 is still a ball for melvin platje but they run on and that is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.880
 for an opponent often euros 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.290
 what they estimate as the end of the season has gone through again and then comes the 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.940
 right though 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.820
 he owes his nickname to people on the line or along the line 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.360
 call this time fell x people want we want sun 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.099
 an extensive summer months 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.219
 I think taking a compliment evening is great 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 yes it is nice to hear them random 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.589
 I have now even compared it to the young delicate I have the think tank at Utrecht 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.869
 also thick skin 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.999
 and then it just came over from 2 percent 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:36.229
 and the one directly from it had the same open-mindedness as there was melvin platje 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.459
 in zaandam is also not good in the small space is also not good 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.729
 and with dick has developed very strongly 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:43.919
 like the people 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.690
 make the comparison with today's dequidt 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.659
 with certainty there is at the moment it is completely wrong 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.249
 I compare it with this year when it then came across to the amateurs 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.249
 if you used to and also van der kuip would like to live here too 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.129
 cooper 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.289
 one of those were 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.259
 days 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.859
 the next time that melvin platje can be admired is on 13 September 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.639
 then he just plays Volendam against Feyenoord in the cockpit where the stadium 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.370
 ever glanced straight out
