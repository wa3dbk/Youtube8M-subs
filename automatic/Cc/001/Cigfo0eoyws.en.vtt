00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello to all adventurers here kresic yes 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.590
 well as you can see I bring you a video 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.059
 commented on one in the bedroom of in the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.620
 minecraft I just recorded a game 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.540
 more has gone quite well and well I'm not going 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.190
 to comment that today I come to tell you about 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.480
 how to comment here in place for all 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.880
 those people who are starting to youtube 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.590
 but I guess it's okay that we 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.570
 of a reference on how to start not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.070
 what people are more or less looking for 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.350
 in a type of comment 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.360
 in a type of gameplay commented because 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.460
 I have seen many times that 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.290
 video comments the gameplays like 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.539
 what am I doing, they are like 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.219
 very very boring nothing people do not 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.109
 they interest me they bore me many 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.600
 gameplays happened to me like five minutes 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.370
 trying to understand what the person 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 is saying and is that they speak super 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.329
 slow and that stresses me then here 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 I come to show you a little bit about 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.159
 how many tips made by me clear 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.809
 you do not have to follow them 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.030
 a few tips that I give you for 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.850
 start commenting more fluidly and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.620
 better we go then good but good everything 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.030
 you have to have an idea of ​​what you are going 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.460
 to comment I mean for example now 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.109
 I have here on my right a small 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.329
 list about what I want to comment on 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.829
 aspects that I want to make known that 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.460
 I want to mention etcetera etcetera no 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.200
 must be 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.840
 drawn up just with a little idea 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.549
 and so that it comes to mind of what 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.290
 you want to talk you know how to have everything 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.320
 thought because this way when commenting 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.540
 is going to be much more entertaining not because 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.159
 not only is the background gameplay that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.990
 now I have left it to you so that 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.520
 entertain to entertain you if 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.500
 you do not want to listen to me it seems 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.420
 interesting because at least you have an example 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.070
 and in the background not that it's more more entertaining 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 that's why not only the temper and background 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.580
 it has to be entertaining but what 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 what you say has to be entertaining 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.229
 for that, a piece of advice that I give you 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.929
 all you think about is , if you are you 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.940
 it goes through my head I know that you 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.619
 like I do not know what a muzzle is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.820
 everything you know everything that happens to you 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.470
 by the mind 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 you must say it because that is one thing that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.759
 I discovered that people like it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.080
 much more so they know more name or 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.640
 it is not how they took you to more you want 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440
 how to be yourself do not say everything 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 think if all that good 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.220
 another thing is that you have to organize what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.899
 what are you going to say for example you can not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.670
 start talking about the map of a 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.890
 video game and then start talking about 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.509
 the gun then start talking about the sun and 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.920
 then go back to the map you do not have to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.209
 organize everything a little bit no if 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 you talk about the map you talk about the map and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.060
 until you end up with the map there 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.150
 you change not unless 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.310
 a punctual thing or something like that to have it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.810
 organized is a way that is a lot 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 more entertaining the video and that people 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.160
 can see what he really wants, bone 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.569
 If you do not want to listen to the map, you can 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.220
 move the video a little bit and find 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.489
 where to talk about the gun or whatever 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.690
 I'm mentioning it as if you were 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.459
 to comment on a gameplay whatever 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.650
 also these tips also serve 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.840
 for video blogs or whatever it is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.550
 what do you do then have it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 organized always helps a lot more to 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.760
 people entertain me more by 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.500
 example entertains me much more and it's 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 much more comfortable when it comes to wanting 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.260
 look for some information in the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.540
 video 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.620
 another thing is to enjoy I mean I 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.269
 example right now it's me I'm 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.310
 going great commenting this video or 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.750
 be not only I'm commenting that of 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.610
 I really think I like it but every time 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.230
 I'm thinking about if you're going to like 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.959
 you in today that makes me happy not 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.610
 then he expressed that motion at the time of 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.780
 comment and I think it's much nicer 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.640
 do not listen to a cheerful person 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.769
 commenting that not one that is you know 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.209
 as tired is right now I am 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.989
 commenting if you could imagine that it was 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.630
 sad you would comment a plan that does not 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.549
 bored or is not fun is not is not 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.300
 for nothing nice do not see a comment 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.920
 A) Yes 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
 the other thing is that if you go to 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.540
 speak fluently speak mostly about 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.130
 please because it's one thing that to me 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.650
 stresses a lot when I want to see a 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.750
 video and it takes half an hour to say 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.280
 something that I want to hear you know and it's all 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.570
 the time saying well and this set 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.520
 that is, there are many who use that 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.160
 style and I get bored a little bit or it's 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.620
 that make me nervous having to 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.950
 wait 20 years to listen to what one 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.620
 he wants to hear no then that's a trick 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.210
 commenting fluid for each people is not 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.710
 bored to comment a little fast no 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.540
 as I am doing now because if 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.250
 You give a lot of information in a short time to 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.230
 I find it much more entertaining 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 although they have also told me that I have 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.440
 that vocalize a little more that's something 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.690
 that I have to keep in mind because 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.980
 talking fast does not mean talking without 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.990
 that you understand you know you have to 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.260
 speak fast and vocalize that is that is 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.060
 the trick is difficult but it is the trick 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.710
 so good a tip that I am 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.380
 good for if you want for example I 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.989
 right now I guess I will do it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.670
 edited I am commenting then you can 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.380
 put music in the background not so it's not 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.210
 quite boring for example in the call 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.110
 of duty or so already incorporates a small 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.090
 background band 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.469
 you hear background shots or whatever 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.060
 but for example in this video of 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.219
 minecraft no background music has been 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.110
 totally lowered the music of 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.150
 minecraft because I do not like it then 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.919
 I have to incorporate him apart music 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.960
 not to make it seem more entertaining anymore 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.300
 it's not just the video but it's giving it 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.710
 social use and not just the gameplay or the 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 comment but it 's late a little bit 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.759
 more of vidilla with a little music 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.310
 no, it does not need to be super 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.560
 music or something like that is only for 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.930
 entertain us but good as you can see 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.849
 won the game a good game I think 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.219
 me and that's all I had to say 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.960
 I remember you have a good time if you want 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.000
 follow these tips so forward if 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.469
 no no and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.020
