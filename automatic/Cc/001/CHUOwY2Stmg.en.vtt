 Of course we will do it in this video first 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.239
 look at the macbook air and look at it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 what is included in the delivery and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.460
 Of course, the macbook air comes up 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 a first directly opposite 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'm your goals synonymous first time 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.820
 Lift and then directly to the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 look at the scope of delivery a little closer than 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.149
 educator of course a little booklet 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 here is all this paperwork in it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
