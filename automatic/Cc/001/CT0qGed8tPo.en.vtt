00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 by the great hype and france of the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.450
 marvel's has u re 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.740
 have a special form developed in 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.790
 the shape of this 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.530
 marco with which we now make kralingen 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.109
 we naturally need one for this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.960
 and pears the white chocolate that she has 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.300
 now a temperature of 28 degrees and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.269
 later may be filled with raspberries and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 marzipan covering our browser 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.199
 of course the shape and tempered 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 chocolate 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.219
 we use a ladle on our own 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.219
 mold nicely into pouring 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 and the chocolate on our form can be removed 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:51.870
 go a little offscreen and now we go 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 our shape and vibrate 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.250
 why is it necessary that way 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 caresses the chocolate very nicely in the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.119
 shape and so we have no air bubbles 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.930
 see the sharks from the bubbles 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.930
 by going upstairs 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.470
 first the nimar bells 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.380
 now of course turn our shape around with 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 the back of our palette knife 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 we click the excess chocolate 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 hit of 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:34.110
 described and per off and our praline 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 form has a nice thin layer of chocolate 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 we want to leave that one 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.729
 crystallize the bottom of ours 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 chocolates ready 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.100
 of course also a top needed 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 then a mascara 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.790
 then take off for five minutes 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.650
 and then in the fridge 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 and there we will now make our filling 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.490
 for the macaroni 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.020
 what do we need 65 grams for that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.070
 cane sugar 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.540
 weigh 60 grams of raspberry and soft 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.289
 125 grams of marzipan 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.200
 50 50 50 50 means that it is marzipan 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.920
 made with 50% hands and 50 percent 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.370
 certain angle a raspberry on us 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.130
 together with the sugar we add ours 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.080
 sugar and now let's all be well 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.580
 continue cooking 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.550
 that way it cabbage me reasonable 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.950
 sugar show of raspberries and with this love 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.320
 of them marzipan or weak 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.660
 so our raspberry sugar syrup is done 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.209
 it is very important to cook it all 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.280
 pieces could be pretty solved 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.880
 now we pour our boiling sugar syrup 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.880
 our society 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.570
 we me and our raspberry sugar syrup 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.290
 well under our marzipan 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.010
 so that we have a homogeneous mass so ours 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.070
 Marzipan 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.959
 is nicely dissolved in our sugar syrup and 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.160
 now let 's cool down for a while 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.270
 has reached room temperature 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.230
 Our fill is cooled Hebbe Hebbe 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.760
 have stopped the upset bag and now 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.760
 according to them forms of 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.880
 and we are talking about a double here 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.450
 keeps both our form 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.220
 shapes go well together 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 so that the filling 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:33.600
 nicely put together still has to be in the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.150
 fridge so that the march can be put on a nice can 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.270
 on stevens 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.270
 so our macarons and ready an old man
