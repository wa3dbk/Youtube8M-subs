00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.000
 will you do a little video for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.019
 show you how to make your 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.690
 own photo frame you can place 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.210
 all kinds of pictures like pictures 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 family photos memories 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 photo of a person of your choice a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 postcard anything what is it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 you just need to do that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 will I have a piece of paper all 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 simply a sheet of A4 paper did 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.059
 take some colors 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 I took a white slap do not you 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.780
 can take a sheet of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 color by rhÃ´ne will take two 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.649
 Canson leaves because it's too hard 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.430
 so it's cardboard it's a small 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 cardboard it is not possible folded 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 so here is it just takes a sheet of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.930
 paper and I will show right away 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 how to make your photo frame so 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.620
 you take your sheet like these 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 and you will come and fold it in half 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.979
 quite simply 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.619
 so this is a photo frame made with 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.659
 had no material 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 just a leaf and it's really very 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 very simple so here you bend it in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.330
 both your sheet by scoring well the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.799
 bending your all along your vaud 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 looting you have to mark your girls 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 like that you'll find but then 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.840
 you will take your sheet and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 come there and still come the bend 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.340
 two like this 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.310
 here is always their hop clip there 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.729
 you will come open your sheet 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 like that so you have the art is 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.219
 the middle ridge you're going to come do 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.880
 two right triangles on this art 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.819
 is a collar and these right triangles 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.700
 well glued on the ridge and that is and 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:12.890
 that these two triangles are equal, 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 like this is what gives you this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.810
 then you will find your triangle 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 that you scored with your rain then 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.690
 you will take that side there the side 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.000
 right you're coming open so to 2 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.019
 and 2.2 of layers of paper you go 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.400
 come take my first layer of 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.010
 paper and this edge there so does this summit 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.049
 you will come and place it on this one 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.329
 while opening the flaw like that I 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:51.060
 did that there that's the edge and you 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.299
 feed like one giving you 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.849
 two triangles follows the triangle you 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.549
 have opened you give two like this 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.349
 this is simply 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.099
 then you will come back your 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.500
 sheet and perform the same operation of 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.530
 the other side so we still believe the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.450
 second effect its guests the 2nd the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.459
 first layer well first mistake of 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.459
 your paper you will come to bend it 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:30.270
 as always here at how the marc 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.940
 bridges here once did it was going 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:40.200
 come knock down like this here 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:44.850
 and on the other side paris then you 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:50.459
 will come take two weeks and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:55.110
 you are well about the master to 5 cm 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:58.590
 from the edge so the party does after 5 cm 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.630
 so that's got to do that's it 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.400
 do to other alain it's the party 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.280
 for for to make your foot actually 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.819
 that's to hold your gift next 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.239
 you will have like these and you go 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.269
 come to pray there are two of a kind 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.830
 of caunes wanted to come so 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:28.229
 made two triangles like that ts2 the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.360
 devices with so that when 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.520
 both are folded all that gives you 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.789
 which deters two pavilions 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.020
 that's what gives you to our taste buds have 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.760
 always be good mark the peaks 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.450
 as if it's a kind of knot 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.800
 butterfly like his under you 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:54.720
 have your foot then go 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.570
 come take your borders here and you 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 come on so masters like this 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.320
 so we'll fix them 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.760
 when we will put our picture to 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.950
 see because not all the photos are 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.289
 not the same so we can adjust to 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.450
 so what the picture between 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.450
 two baths did that on the other side 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:27.100
 to lose like that then we take 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.380
 our picture like that so there we can 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:36.370
 see that there is a lot of a lot of 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:43.020
 place so we'll keep watching 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.020
 simon casas the other way I was 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:50.289
 like that when you look or I 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 am who can really not push 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.220
 again go well is easy target 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:00.070
 simple if you want to leave some of 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:04.210
 white yes but that's how it is 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.520
 perfect and you will come and fold the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.419
 rectangle spaces that are there you me 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.419
 fold on the map 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.410
 here 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.150
 clear this one then you will come 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.340
 in view the map skiff 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.650
 you only have to stay in the 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.590
 slots in the slots here are found 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:34.030
 on each side we could only see 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.320
 there four years ago you will come 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:42.720
 put me every corner of the map 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:47.170
 or the management photo as it is 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.670
 and you get a nice frame have 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.770
 then with the little one the little foot 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.220
 that we put behind we can do it 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:57.310
 stand up like that wine diviner 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:02.380
 night table like that anywhere on 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:06.280
 a chimney or yes and that's enough 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.900
 nice I think so that's it if you 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.670
 so that can be a very good idea 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.180
 gift for Mother's Day and the 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.180
 fathers Day 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.640
 if you want to put a souvenir photo 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.640
 so here it was how to make a 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.620
 picture frame yourself I tell you to very 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.790
 well thank you for watching the video 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.790
