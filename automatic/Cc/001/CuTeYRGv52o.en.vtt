pointing<00:02:30.840> us<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.410> round<00:02:32.130> 2<00:02:32.370> by<00:02:32.519> 2<00:02:32.640> tile

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
pointing us out this round 2 by 2 tile

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.839 
pointing us out this round 2 by 2 tile
with<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.630> hole<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.140> i<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:35.370> that's<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.700> new

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.400 
with a hole in it i think that's a new
piece<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.450> think<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:36.959> might<00:02:37.019> be<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.380> first

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
piece I think this might be the first

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.729 
piece I think this might be the first
set<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.950> came<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:40.049> here<00:02:40.080> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
set it came in and then down here this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.430 
set it came in and then down here this
pops<00:02:41.430> open<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.480> two<00:02:42.720> minifigs<00:02:43.260> like

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
pops open you get the two minifigs like

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680 
pops open you get the two minifigs like
I<00:02:43.530> showed<00:02:43.739> let's<00:02:44.580> look<00:02:44.940> inside<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.569> little

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I showed let's look inside it a little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.350 
I showed let's look inside it a little
bit<00:02:45.870> better<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.590> got<00:02:46.769> some<00:02:47.090> levers<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
bit better you got some levers and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.870 
bit better you got some levers and
switches<00:02:48.390> probably<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.530> water<00:02:50.370> pumper

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
switches probably for that water pumper

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.979 
switches probably for that water pumper
and<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.870> choose<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> looking<00:02:52.769> at<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.950> gauges

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
and you choose a looking at the gauges

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.140 
and you choose a looking at the gauges
so<00:02:54.989> obviously<00:02:55.560> that's<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.950> sticker<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.000> that's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150

a the smaller ones of printed brick it's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.949 
a the smaller ones of printed brick it's
a<00:03:01.230> pretty<00:03:01.470> common<00:03:01.769> printed<00:03:02.220> brick<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
a pretty common printed brick and this

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.470

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
airport or even if you just want

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.400 
airport or even if you just want
something<00:03:36.299> different<00:03:36.510> your<00:03:36.870> city<00:03:37.139> besides

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
something different your city besides

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.160 
something different your city besides
the<00:03:37.859> typical<00:03:38.340> fire<00:03:39.150> engines<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.900> get

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the typical fire engines that we get

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.809 
the typical fire engines that we get
this<00:03:40.500> would<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.920> really<00:03:40.980> good<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.639> get

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
this would be a really good one to get

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.460 
this would be a really good one to get
now<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> do<00:03:42.900> get<00:03:43.370> one<00:03:44.370> plane<00:03:44.730> engine<00:03:45.180> that's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
now you do get one plane engine that's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.319 
now you do get one plane engine that's
obviously<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:46.799> fell<00:03:47.130> off<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.639> plane<00:03:47.940> or

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
obviously there fell off the plane or

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.569 
obviously there fell off the plane or
you<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.630> use<00:03:48.660> your<00:03:48.959> imagination<00:03:49.739> on<00:03:49.920> what

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
you can use your imagination on what

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.039 
you can use your imagination on what
happened<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> rest<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.510> plane<00:03:51.780> here

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
happened to the rest of the plane here

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.379 
happened to the rest of the plane here
but<00:03:53.010> obviously<00:03:53.250> they're<00:03:53.730> trying<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.060> put<00:03:54.239> this

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
but obviously they're trying to put this

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.379 
but obviously they're trying to put this
out<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.859> imagine<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> runway

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
out so you imagine that on the runway

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.960 
out so you imagine that on the runway
and<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> truck<00:03:58.680> comes<00:03:58.920> flying<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.760> puts

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
and the truck comes flying up and puts

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.120 
and the truck comes flying up and puts
that<00:04:00.120> out<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.989> don't<00:04:01.380> think<00:04:01.739> you're<00:04:01.829> having

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
that out so I don't think you're having

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.849 
that out so I don't think you're having
trouble<00:04:02.459> with<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:03.750> yeah<00:04:03.959> guys<00:04:04.200> I'd<00:04:04.560> say

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
trouble with that but yeah guys I'd say

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.819 
trouble with that but yeah guys I'd say
if<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:06.000> have<00:04:06.150> an<00:04:06.269> airport<00:04:06.599> or<00:04:06.810> you're<00:04:07.109> into

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
if you have an airport or you're into

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.559 
if you have an airport or you're into
the<00:04:07.950> fire<00:04:08.160> theme<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:08.940> definitely<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.389> good
