or<00:02:12.000> well<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.260> such<00:02:13.769> as

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
or well I think it just is such as

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
or well I think it just is such as
myself<00:02:14.459> was<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:14.670> hour<00:02:14.820> plane<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.420> get

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
myself was an hour plane I think you get

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.300 
myself was an hour plane I think you get
natural<00:02:16.260> gold<00:02:16.410> scores<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.950> certainly

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
natural gold scores and I certainly

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.550 
natural gold scores and I certainly
think<00:02:17.459> Bobbitt<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> natural<00:02:18.360> goalscorer<00:02:18.810> he

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
think Bobbitt is a natural goalscorer he

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.400 
think Bobbitt is a natural goalscorer he
scored<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.100> lot<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.580> chances<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:22.019> he's<00:02:22.230> also

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
scored a lot of chances and he's also

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
scored a lot of chances and he's also
