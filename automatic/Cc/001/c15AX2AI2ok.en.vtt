pixel<00:00:28.529> pitch<00:00:28.710> panel<00:00:29.160> let's<00:00:29.550> look<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> back

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
pixel pitch panel let's look at the back

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
pixel pitch panel let's look at the back
here<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.189> linking

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
here so what we have here is a linking

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
here so what we have here is a linking
hardware<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.480> similar<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.469> MVP

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
