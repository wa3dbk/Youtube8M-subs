I<00:01:18.869> did<00:01:19.530> leave<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> brows<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.210> they

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I did leave the brows in because they

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800 
I did leave the brows in because they
are<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.799> different<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.330> wish<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
are a little bit different I wish that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.850 
are a little bit different I wish that
my<00:01:25.020> brows<00:01:26.030> were<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.330> bit<00:01:27.540> thinner<00:01:27.930> um

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
my brows were a little bit thinner um

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.999 
my brows were a little bit thinner um
because<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:30.240> she<00:01:30.900> doesn't<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.470> thick<00:01:31.740> brows

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
because if she doesn't have thick brows

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.840 
because if she doesn't have thick brows
but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> can't<00:01:32.640> thin<00:01:33.030> my<00:01:33.299> eyebrows<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.990> like

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
but I can't thin my eyebrows out like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
but I can't thin my eyebrows out like
shy<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.090> plucking<00:01:36.390> them<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.930> can't<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.860> fix

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
shy of plucking them I can't really fix

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.910 
shy of plucking them I can't really fix
them<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> play<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
them so I kind of have to play with the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
them so I kind of have to play with the
shapes<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.780> really<00:01:42.780> pay<00:01:42.930> attention<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
shapes and really pay attention to the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.520 
shapes and really pay attention to the
shapes<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.850> people's<00:01:45.840> browse<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> try

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
shapes I see on people's browse and try

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
shapes I see on people's browse and try
to<00:01:46.590> emulate<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.399> way<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.509> just

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to emulate it that way because I just

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.670 
to emulate it that way because I just
can't<00:01:49.170> bring<00:01:49.409> myself<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.780> pluck<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.350> brows

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
can't bring myself to pluck out my brows

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.700 
can't bring myself to pluck out my brows
and<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.610> thin<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.470> that's<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and make them thin because that's just

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.569 
and make them thin because that's just
not<00:01:55.890> who<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.250> am<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.149> thick<00:01:57.509> brows<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> it

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
the shape off and just trying to make it

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.699 
the shape off and just trying to make it
as<00:04:14.300> close<00:04:15.300> as<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> shape<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.290> she

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
as close as I can to the shape that she

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.610 
as close as I can to the shape that she
had<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.190> then<00:04:17.730> filling<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.270> in<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.450> black<00:04:18.930> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
had and then filling it in with black to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:28.070 
had and then filling it in with black to
make<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.950> nice<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.430> dark<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.270> vampy

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.090 

and<00:04:29.080> then<00:04:29.200> I'm<00:04:29.290> going<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.470> keep<00:04:29.680> going<00:04:29.860> back

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
and then I'm going to keep going back

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.590 
and then I'm going to keep going back
and<00:04:30.160> forth<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.700> trying<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.420> perfect

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
and forth just trying to get it perfect

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.980 
and forth just trying to get it perfect
I<00:04:32.560> think<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.310> cut<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.760> part<00:04:34.000> out<00:04:34.150> where<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.450> blend

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I think I cut the part out where I blend

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.780 
I think I cut the part out where I blend
the<00:04:35.290> top<00:04:35.530> edge<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.460> want<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.700> make

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
the top edge but you do want to make

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.550 
the top edge but you do want to make
sure<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.270> top<00:04:37.540> edge<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.960> blended<00:04:38.350> out

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
sure that that top edge is blended out

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.550 
sure that that top edge is blended out
and<00:04:39.600> then<00:04:40.600> you're<00:04:40.750> going<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.900> pull<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.290> black

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
and then you're going to pull the black

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.840 
and then you're going to pull the black
underneath<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.460> eye<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.850> well<00:04:47.760> then<00:04:48.760> I'm

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
underneath the eye as well then I'm

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.550 
underneath the eye as well then I'm
going<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.030> take<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.540> matte<00:04:49.750> burgundy<00:04:49.990> color

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
going to take a matte burgundy color

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.160 
going to take a matte burgundy color
from<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:50.920> sleek<00:04:51.250> bohemian<00:04:51.940> palette<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.540> that

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
from the sleek bohemian palette and that

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.450 
from the sleek bohemian palette and that
we're<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.710> use<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.070> blend<00:04:54.310> out<00:04:54.430> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
we're going to use to blend out the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.130 
we're going to use to blend out the
edges<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.920> outer<00:04:57.130> edges<00:04:58.140> there's

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
edges just on the outer edges there's

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.250 
edges just on the outer edges there's
not<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.710> ton<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.010> this<00:05:00.340> color<00:05:00.870> peeking<00:05:01.870> through

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
not a ton of this color peeking through

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.650 
not a ton of this color peeking through
it's<00:05:03.040> just<00:05:03.460> enough<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.000> tell<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.450> there<00:05:04.630> is

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
it's just enough to tell that there is

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.790 
it's just enough to tell that there is
another<00:05:05.140> color<00:05:05.590> there<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:11.200> spent<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.590> lot<00:05:11.770> of

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
another color there and I spent a lot of

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.880 
another color there and I spent a lot of
time<00:05:11.920> really<00:05:12.370> making<00:05:12.760> sure<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.330> blended<00:05:13.890> so

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
time really making sure that blended so
