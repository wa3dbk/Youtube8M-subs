00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
right this is a metal type let me think

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.210 
right this is a metal type let me think
about<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.139> tough<00:03:28.470> one<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.919> think

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
about this this is a tough one I think

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.199 
about this this is a tough one I think
we're<00:03:29.519> his<00:03:29.880> weekends<00:03:30.359> light<00:03:31.190> or<00:03:32.190> dark<00:03:32.669> oh<00:03:33.470> boy

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
we're his weekends light or dark oh boy

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.379 
we're his weekends light or dark oh boy
all<00:03:36.209> right<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:37.519> thought<00:03:38.519> we<00:03:38.639> were<00:03:38.760> smooth<00:03:39.090> sail

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
all right I thought we were smooth sail

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:50.210 
all right I thought we were smooth sail
then<00:03:41.090> metal<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.209> weak<00:03:42.450> against<00:03:42.780> dark<00:03:49.010> there<00:03:50.010> we

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
then metal is weak against dark there we

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.050 
then metal is weak against dark there we
go<00:03:50.599> all<00:03:51.599> right<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:51.900> meadows<00:03:52.199> weekends<00:03:52.650> dark<00:03:53.060> go

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
go all right so meadows weekends dark go

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.710 
go all right so meadows weekends dark go
in<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:54.599> on<00:03:54.780> another<00:03:55.379> unknown<00:03:56.329> dragon<00:03:59.720> which

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
in here on another unknown dragon which

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.629 
in here on another unknown dragon which
means<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.290> should<00:04:01.470> send<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.190> four-element

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
means we should send in a four-element

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.780 
means we should send in a four-element
dragon<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.510> we<00:04:03.599> just<00:04:03.780> went<00:04:04.019> past<00:04:04.379> it<00:04:04.739> which<00:04:05.609> is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
dragon and we just went past it which is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.520 
dragon and we just went past it which is
really<00:04:06.060> unfortunate<00:04:06.660> when<00:04:07.230> we<00:04:07.769> went<00:04:07.949> past<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
really unfortunate when we went past it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.349 
really unfortunate when we went past it
should<00:04:10.530> we<00:04:10.620> send<00:04:10.799> our<00:04:11.040> legendary<00:04:11.549> no<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.000> don't

think or four players that don't have

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.619 
think or four players that don't have
legendary<00:04:14.849> dragon<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.419> would<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.599> a

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
legendary dragon that would be a
