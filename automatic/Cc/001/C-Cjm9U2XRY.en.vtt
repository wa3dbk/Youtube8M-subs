00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 Kathmandu is the political center and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 cultural of Nepal and also the greatest 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 city of the country one of the ethnicities that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.689
 live here are the snowy ones and so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.689
 also call the place we visited today 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.890
 here a specialty is served in poles 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.890
 from the valley of Kathmandu 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.629
 and more to the white part is a mass 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.120
 made of a particular type of lentils 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.280
 that nepal we call more first you have to 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 take out the husk and grind the lentils 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.860
 to make flour then water is added 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 ginger and herbs with the hand I give the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 shape and then I fry it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 they are served with very different 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 Accompaniments and in three possible 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.040
 variants the simplest costs about 15 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
 cents of euros can also be 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 order with egg or meat filling 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.619
 chopped seasoned and spicy for about 50 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.619
 cents 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.060
 the owners of the place are anita expire 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.620
 expensive and her husband 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 here the bara is served in a way 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.540
 traditional with potato soup 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.469
 from noon the place fills up 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.350
 customers come from all neighborhoods of 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.390
 the city at the beginning the southern chief among 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.500
 I thought kart doubted that the business 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.500
 to succeed 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.650
 one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.150
 this location is not very good for a 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.810
 food stand is too far 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.810
 from the center 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.700
 and his father was a famous cook in 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.009
 kathmandu customers trust him and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.899
 they appreciate their cuisine that respects 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.899
 regional culinary tradition 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.700
 my favorite rod is with egg and potatoes 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.520
 I am a vegetarian and for me it is the best 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.890
 and for these gentlemen 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.250
 I like eating stick because the lentils 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.690
 they come from the base of campano but not only 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.770
 that's why the combination with egg and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.770
 vegetable is very healthy 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.280
 undoubtedly a specialty that awakens 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.280
 the appetite
