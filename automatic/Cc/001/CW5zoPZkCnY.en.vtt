00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.350
 public hearings on this crucial 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.150
 town planning issue passed on 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.069
 surprise peacefully serious controversy 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.719
 probability of road widening on the way and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 Soviet areas are moving did not cause 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
 although participants and presented project on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 which part of private houses and land 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.720
 plots when expanding the road will 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 beyond the red line and will be demolished 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:32.810
 dissatisfied with the coming relocation were 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:32.810
 units by the pawnshop and 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.390
 however, grad grad 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.550
 should be as straight as possible 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.020
 can dodge and bypass private gardens 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 now because of the narrowing on this 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.739
 strategically important fortified settlement 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.110
 the crossroads there is a daily collapse 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 at peak times so many residents even 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.720
 tired of living near standing eternal clover 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 the road i like car enthusiasts as a resident 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.370
 cities I feel sorry for spending 40 minutes 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.250
 your personal time in the morning and in the evening 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.050
 in order to stand in a traffic jam project 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.910
 expansion of the highway in the area of ​​ancient settlement 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.160
 provides for 6 bands in the future 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.350
 traffic width will increase to 40 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:24.250
 meters however some thought that 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:25.899
 term this is not enough however, 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.000
 project planning had to be taken into account 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.979
 all sorts of compromises on the one hand 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.289
 alleviate the transport problem with 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.660
 other get along minimal house demolition 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.430
 for many years prevents the bottle to expand 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.170
 neck on the turn of the gates here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.500
 this house is literally at a crossroads 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.720
 at Bezhetskaya 262 live or 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.760
 there are almost a half dozen families 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.439
 the city tried many times to settle this 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.939
 house on reasonable terms but the owners 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.790
 made too high demands 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.650
 on the provision of apartments or cash 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.110
 compensation is completely unbearable for 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.820
 treasury and now the designation in the project 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.500
 the so-called red lines that is 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.390
 the brink of building gives the right to urban 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.790
 authorities in such cases require demolition 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.320
 through the court even with the disagreement of the hosts on 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 legally it will be possible 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 free land for 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.729
 municipal needs 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.860
 it will allow 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.989
 local government is not toothless 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.360
 approach approach let's say man 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.860
 which hinders the development of the road 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.690
 School building any more 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.900
 object budget orientation is very 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 important yes you can now turn on the mechanism 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.580
 forced land acquisition if 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.709
 amicably not agree as i said 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.690
 then a judicial decision will be determined 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.640
 reasonable degree of compensation of course 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.620
 implementation of the adopted project will require 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.049
 time and most importantly not small money even on 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.239
 reasonable compensation before the start of the real 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.299
 demolition to go through a lot of legal 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.470
 procedures in this of a land survey project 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:51.640
 then it means to produce if available 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.799
 financing means land valuation 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 land plots that falls into 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.709
 these bounds ie this process is pretty 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.720
 long but start once it is necessary 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.819
 most likely the project will be performed by 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.739
 parts and it will take years of all 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.780
 who will be affected by the demolition must warn 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.410
 for the year so that the owners are prepared and not 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.180
 started up 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.040
 construction of new extensions or 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.019
 garages will be evaluated only 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.750
 existing buildings as well 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.970
