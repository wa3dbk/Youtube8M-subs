00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
just going to slide it in because it is

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.920 
just going to slide it in because it is
a<00:03:24.520> fairly<00:03:24.880> heavy<00:03:25.209> bird<00:03:27.600> don't<00:03:28.600> worry<00:03:28.750> about

the juices now you will get your

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.660 
the juices now you will get your
turducken<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.050> will<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.380> frozen<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.640> I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
turducken and it will be frozen so I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.449
