girl to guess where but who to work
let's<00:03:10.160> try<00:03:10.220> one<00:03:10.579> let's<00:03:10.819> go<00:03:11.030> see<00:03:11.630> which<00:03:11.810> shooter

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
let's try one let's go see which shooter

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.870 
let's try one let's go see which shooter
works<00:03:12.319> see<00:03:12.980> if<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.160> can<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.370> clever<00:03:13.639> enough<00:03:13.760> to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
works see if you can be clever enough to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
works see if you can be clever enough to
guess<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.420> time<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.989> think<00:03:15.650> you're<00:03:15.739> gonna<00:03:15.859> be

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
this is a trick question there's more

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.339 
this is a trick question there's more
than<00:03:22.849> these<00:03:23.000> three<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.510> table<00:03:23.900> which<00:03:24.139> one

than these three on the table which one

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.120 
than these three on the table which one
works<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:25.760> Wow<00:03:26.060> you're<00:03:26.989> right<00:03:27.319> there<00:03:27.769> we<00:03:27.889> go
