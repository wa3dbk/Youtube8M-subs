 so we download 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 we save the file 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 so that downloading

 so once downloaded first a download even know his 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.970

 the first baby will run for purchase on your computer 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.000
 you create a ps3 folder 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 like these 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 a pause with a ps3 file written in uppercase 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.820
 you open this folder and you create another folder a little both countries 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.890
 in the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.790
 open this folder 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 you master the challenge or download 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 so we'll have a good day 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.010
 what we have a minute left 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.010
 during this dead time on the ps3 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 holder in the settings 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.839
 help using a blender or racist 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.149
 eleven against eleven 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:21.639
 and the beauty care role desiring the list of carriers 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.669
 digital 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.189
 tonight at 8 pm meal 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 port-au-prince - the relationship to others 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.849
 practically in the hands 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.849
 do not jot down gingham is called ps3 this date 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.829
 but not tomorrow the normal gatti family 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 eight seconds 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.529
 the day the top forced files 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.869
 left discipline like ps3 can not be a bitch the fact that he does not 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.109
 believes 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.249
 chooses to copy it 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.249
 then I go back to the page 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.989
 that you showed 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.939
 beginning of the cycle of the most affluent seasons 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.779
 the little right click 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.659
 my colleagues 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.659
 so there his copy 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.849
 mons got the upper hand on a team keeping up low volumes 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.779
 no one knows exactly what it's all about 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.390
 so you have to have at least 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.390
 at 1,200 billion pounds his delusional optimism 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.710
 we need the crisis do not suit us there 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.039
 very well in the market or closed 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.039
 and no need for a computer 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.129
 the disconnect 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.689
 the key 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.689
 we can think that was not very strong for me 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.590
 and where the voice in the chapter 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.590
 on playstation 3 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.099
 here 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.169
 so you try the other main authors 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.990
 to the development program so it's normal that I can not accept it 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.919
 so there was an improvement of more than 19 million units passed 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.479
 to install mediation 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.479
 we have good for everyone 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.059
 and you settle the buzz 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.190
 you know this video sent 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.830
 heyer
