group<00:02:17.430> basically<00:02:17.700> let<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.000> reboot<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.450> its

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
group basically let it reboot to its

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.470 
group basically let it reboot to its
factory<00:02:18.930> state<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.580> depending<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.239> how<00:02:21.330> much

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
factory state and depending on how much

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
factory state and depending on how much
you've<00:02:21.630> got<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.840> there<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.050> could<00:02:22.200> take<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.380> few

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you've got in there it could take a few

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:46.070 
you've got in there it could take a few
minutes

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.720 

so<00:02:46.650> once<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:46.980> rebooted<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.640> done

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
so once it's rebooted and done

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.090 
so once it's rebooted and done
everything<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> needs<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.920> can

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
free the setup process again puts it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.620 
free the setup process again puts it
back<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.350> factory<00:02:52.470> state<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.360> should<00:02:54.540> be

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
