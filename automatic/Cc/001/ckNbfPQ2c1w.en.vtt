00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello everyone what reason welcome to the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.180
 channel and welcome to a new top 5 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.800
 videogames this time after 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.960
 a couple of weeks that you have 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 been asking then finally the top 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.670
 five impossible video games or 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.320
 more difficult video games and remember that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.640
 this is a totally personal opinion 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 they are video games that at least to me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 it seemed quite complicated both in my 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.980
 childhood like right now and that is that it gives a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.379
 little chance that at least the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.179
 most of them are a bit of the old 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.319
 school so I do not know if it 's that now 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.229
 same videogames are made more 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:42.269
 easy what happens but finally remember 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.679
 that you do not want to leave me down in the 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.089
 comments any kind of opinion 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.819
 for you what would be the five 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.739
 more difficult videos or upcoming ideas 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.749
 for next five tops of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 videogames so you know we're going to 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.079
 go on to comment to see what awaits us and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.280
 before starting as is usually 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 usual that I'm going to do putting some 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.909
 that another title that for a reason or for 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.959
 another has been out of the top but 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.819
 that at least they are worth being 

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:04.830
 named as for example the answer 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.920
 platform in the platform and just me 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.070
 It seems that it is called in South America 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.750
 there is a beam and two titles that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.460
 such are not video games because they 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.500
 can download by flash then 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.570
 it did not seem fair to put them in the same 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.369
 sack that the rest of titles and also 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.380
 for example impossible gain time me 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.820
 I would have liked to comment because it was 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.250
 quite complicated it is true that 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.750
 simply mechanical learn the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.369
 dynamic and little more so it gives a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.159
 little what exists such a difficulty 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.810
 but this is quite complicated and 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.549
 less worth being named in the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.350
 fifth position would place a title that 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.509
 almost nobody would expect precisely 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.840
 coming from the saga super mario and is that 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.110
 in this case back in 1986 it came out in 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.140
 Japan a delivery called Super Mario 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.700
 the levels said subject was so complicated 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.159
 its developers thought it was so 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.380
 complicated that they did not try to take it out on 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.819
 the western market ie the USA 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.110
 and in Europe precisely because of that because 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.690
 they said it was too complicated to 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.369
 that we spend it imagine how 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.890
 had to be what you see on the screen is 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.310
 a gameplay of that edition of the of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.410
 1986 while back in 1993 in a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.930
 compilation of the best titles of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 that of this saga for super nintendo 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.120
 they decided to include him also 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.500
 it is true that they reduce a little the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.330
 difficulty for people to be 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.910
 easier to pass it but good now 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.410
 yes anecdotal data and in the fourth 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.270
 position will position a videogame room 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.130
 well known not so much as it is 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.840
 logical as 'super mario' good I hope 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.080
 that at least is quite important and it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.490
 It is Ninja Gaiden in 1988 left 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 the first installment of this title much 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 it has rained since then the river ninja 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.670
 all the senses evolve but 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 well the difficulty is still the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.660
 main objective of all these 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.460
 titles of the whole saga that this same 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.740
 year took a new delivery if badly 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.200
 I remember for xbox 360 and they told me 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.610
 quite worth the truth the grace of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.470
 this title of this saga better said 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.850
 resides especially in 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.820
 clashes against the final bosses 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.860
 where every movement every little blow 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.210
 can end your life which makes 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.890
 more interesting of course the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.480
 video game and as I say one of the most 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.470
 complicated and the sagas that has better 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.060
 known to evolve in terms of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.680
 complication and in the third installment the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.450
 leaving the sagas a little aside and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 focusing on individual titles 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.320
 we find ourselves with possibly as 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.390
 I say the most current title of this list 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
 but he remembers a lot in terms of 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.810
 difficulty to old glories as per 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.730
 example could be in this case dark 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.879
 souls a title that came out the year 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.019
 for xbox 360 and playstation3 this year what 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.549
 has done if I remember badly for 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.980
 computer due to some delay that 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.239
 there was but good enough I deserve 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.040
 pity remember in certain mean also 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.480
 little ninja gaiden but this case 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.220
 we are a gentleman that we are advancing 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.470
 through different dungeons facing the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 with skeletons ghosts demons in 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.099
 general that we have to go defeating and 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.290
 the final confrontations against 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.049
 bosses are usually quite interesting 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.849
 against like bugs that bends us what 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.829
 triple in size but not only 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.690
 size matters as usual 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.220
 usual and the smallest of the bugs 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.079
 You can finish us off at a stroke 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.239
 no appetite so a video game there 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.239
 to always be with the senses when 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.440
 maximum because any small 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.629
 startled that you do not take into account 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.459
 can kill so of course very 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.989
 complicated dark souls you arrive at a 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.090
 position about to get the first 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.069
 so still to the title against 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.440
 maybe some of the older ones of the canal 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.329
 You can remember it with great joy but 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.579
 certainly to all of you 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.500
 remember the title light metals but of 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.260
 done this last saga metal slug came out 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.479
 in the 90s and to some extent despite 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.320
 which is more successful was the one that copied 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.060
 against 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.430
 Obviously obviously metal 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.340
 Slug was much more affordable and against 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.230
 the difficulty was amazing indeed its 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 own creators the video game was one 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.860
 of the first ones of that time of the Danish 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.050
 to include the possibility of playing two 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.050
 players and creators assured that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.240
 the only way to pass the video game 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.740
 deformed within affordable quotes was 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.570
 playing the two players or if it was not 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.910
 impossible practically for you to go 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.050
 you do not know a little about the idea of 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.270
 complication that involved the difficulty 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.650
 so immense that he had and of course a 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.480
 pretty innovative title as you have 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
 seen in including the multiplayer in a 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.770
 video game so difficult so a 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.840
 second position energy certainly has 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.370
 the first place would place a video game 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.230
 that they throw lots of waves when 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.630
 it was small many lost afternoons 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.030
 many fools angry for playing this 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.190
 title and not get to pass it to me and it 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.260
 It deals with battle toast or fields of 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.730
 battle the literal translation a 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.210
 pretty curious video game that came out 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.610
 back in 1991 weeks I remember and that we 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.810
 put in the skin of a pair of toads that 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.030
 we have to rescue our friends 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.040
 you could play a single player 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.960
 in this case quite similar in that 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.990
 aspect against but if it comes against 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.150
 playing 2 be two people playing us 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.070
 allowed greater ease between 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.630
 comillas when passing the video game to us 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.680
 this title also as it is logical I think 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.230
 that you have to be very careful because 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.970
 there was friend fire or friend harm like 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.290
 you want to call us with 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.060
 other blows we could kill our 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 partner and vice versa which neither 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.840
 it did not help much either that it was more 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.460
 easy the video game in fact not almost 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.930
 trading is more complicated but 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.150
 any way a title that sure 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.220
 Those who follow videogames more 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.230
 retro more classic you'll remember super 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.490
 complicated and if you have never tried os 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.680
 I recommend a lot that you throw a 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.880
 look and download them if 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.350
 can you somehow for you to see 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.120
 how complicated was the games that 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.070
 time and the works had to throw them 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.840
 to be able to go through and finally 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.190
 here this top 5 video game many 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.440
 titles of which we have commented are 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.060
 quite old then I imagine 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.280
 that some of you little ones 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.660
 that you are watching the channel maybe not the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.790
 you know you have not even heard 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.410
 of them but well that should not be a 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.850
 impediment in fact I recommend that 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.680
 if you have never heard of them 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.270
 you take a look at your own 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.830
 can you suppose they are pretty 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.420
 accessible now of power 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.520
 at the time of being able to download them so 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.530
 try it if you tell me if you get angry and 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.330
 blush with them or if they are easy to 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.710
 pass and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.060
 liked do not hesitate to leave me under 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.330
 your opinion in the comments 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.990
 and nothing happier and see you blog 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.990
