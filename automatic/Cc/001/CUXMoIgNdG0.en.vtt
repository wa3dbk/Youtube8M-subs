00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Korean cars can be but this straight

Korean cars can be but this straight
away<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.469> better<00:00:34.739> before<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
away you know it's better before you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
away you know it's better before you
even<00:00:35.520> drive<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.090> much<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> millimeter<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
even drive so much as a millimeter in it

how<00:00:37.800> did<00:00:38.160> Kia<00:00:38.489> manage<00:00:38.879> such<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> vast

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
how did Kia manage such a vast

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
how did Kia manage such a vast
improvement<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.170> such<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> short<00:00:40.710> time<00:00:40.910> maybe

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
improvement in such a short time maybe

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.220 
improvement in such a short time maybe
it's<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.510> listen<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.079> their

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
it's because they listen to all their

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
it's because they listen to all their
market<00:00:43.590> research<00:00:43.920> maybe<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:44.820> they

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
market research maybe it's because they

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
market research maybe it's because they
got<00:00:45.180> tired<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> building<00:00:45.899> ugly<00:00:46.440> cars<00:00:46.739> maybe

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
got tired of building ugly cars maybe

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.889 
got tired of building ugly cars maybe
it's<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.180> both<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:48.660> things

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's because of both of these things

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's because of both of these things
combined<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> fact<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.280> hired<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
combined with the fact that they hired a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000 
combined with the fact that they hired a

now i'm not sure if he'll schreier had

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
now i'm not sure if he'll schreier had
anything<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.550> do<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.940> LED<00:01:06.420> detailing

you combine it with us rather thick a

you combine it with us rather thick a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:20.719 
think about it this car has got a few

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.250 
think about it this car has got a few
odd<00:03:21.069> combinations<00:03:22.150> for<00:03:23.150> example<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.719> has<00:03:23.780> hill

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
odd combinations for example it has hill

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.020 
odd combinations for example it has hill
descent<00:03:24.560> control<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.280> center<00:03:25.609> diff<00:03:25.819> lock

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459
