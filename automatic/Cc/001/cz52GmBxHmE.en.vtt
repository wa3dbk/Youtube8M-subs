00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.770
 new video this same be a bit short 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.359
 nothing more and it is a video at the request of 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.460
 some people who are commenting on 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.440
 the new series that I'm uploading from the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.269
 simpsons hit and run are asking me 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.370
 that you leave the download link so that 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.960
 play it on your computer and then here 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.120
 below in the description of this video 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.010
 they will have two links they have to enter 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.260
 and download the two files on 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.750
 first is the game the simpsons hit and 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.370
 run but it 's in English that's why 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.470
 I leave a second link that will serve 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.180
 to put the game in Spanish once 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.580
 have downloaded those two files 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.220
 decompress it where you want and 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.110
 Well, here they are going to have the folder of the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.310
 simpsons game but for what 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.080
 put in Spanish 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.900
 also decompress the second file 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.120
 then they copy this and stick it on the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.730
 folder where they have the game installed 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.820
 they give to paste replace the file that 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.620
 have and then you 're ready to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.410
 that can play racing are hit and run 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.870
 in Spanish I'm going to try it quickly 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.440
 they enter the game folder they give to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.579
 start and they'll be able to play with that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.839
 Yellow character that so many people 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.179
 he wants no 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.280
 and is now going to be able to play with the 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:11.280
 best player of all time 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.299

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.259
 has liked all the people and 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.549

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.209
 they have them and for those people who 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.649
