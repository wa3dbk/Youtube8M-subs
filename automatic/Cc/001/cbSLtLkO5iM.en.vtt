00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.690
 hello my name is tim stuckmann and 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.119
 I work at the telekom 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.250
 i wish for my wallet 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.760
 It's also an icloud or the telekom 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.900
 give cloud as well as for the iphone 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.539
 I have a wallet recently 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.180
 lost money cards badges all gone 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.010
 luckily that has to be mine 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.289
 Data does not happen because I can 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.389
 quite simply a free one 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.839
 data backup a so-called backup in 

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:43.729
 the icloud create the iCloud is one 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.899
 virtual hard drive of apple and the 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:49.190
 Data on it are available at any time 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.229
 that is also very helpful though 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.089
 they got a new iphone and 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.030
 now want to transfer all your data 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.649
 no problem with the cloud 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.629
 when they set up their iphone 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.039
 do you have the option iCloud backup 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.779
 activated no 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.930
 then you can do it easily 

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:09.740
 make up for it 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:16.210
 Settings iCloud then give yours 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:20.600
 apple id and her password an open 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.140
 memory and backup and activate them 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.710
 here the option iCloud backup and the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.600
 it was already created iCloud 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 every day a backup of your iphone over 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.890
 but wlan of course only then 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.380
 if you are not using it right now 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.299
 and it is connected to the electricity we 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 do that now we create one 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.649
 backup date and time of the last 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.789
 Data backup will be here below 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.369
 screen memory and backup displayed 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.770
 whether photos apps books settings or 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.039
 messages with the iCloud backup 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.819
 you secure all your data 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.710
 However, this is true in Germany 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.579
 not for purchased music and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.170
 telecasts 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.869
 but there is also a solution for this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 and itunes match you must 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.769
 Of course, not all data backed up 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 decide for yourself what you are looking for 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.040
 wants to have a virtual hard disk 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.910
 you can do that in itunes under the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.920
 menu item iCloud a note still you 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.950
 You can either backup the data only 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 to perform on your pc with itunes or 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.709
 about wlan with the icloud both 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.450
 but not at the same time, of course 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.720
 You can always adjust the setting 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.269
 change data storage to pc or in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.890
 the iCloud 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.260
 In any case, this never comes back 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.120
 funny photo an important contact or 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.080
 an exciting book lost 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.080
 that's how it goes
