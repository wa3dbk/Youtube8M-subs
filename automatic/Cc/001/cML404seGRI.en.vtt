paint application what's really

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.050 
paint application what's really
interesting<00:01:56.500> about<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:57.069> piece<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.549> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
interesting about this piece is the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.180 
interesting about this piece is the
additional<00:01:58.750> detail<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.709> end<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.009> which

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
additional detail on the end and which

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.430 
additional detail on the end and which
the<00:02:00.399> blade<00:02:00.640> comes<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:02.020> really<00:02:02.110> hard<00:02:02.350> to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
the blade comes out it's really hard to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.620 
the blade comes out it's really hard to
see<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:02.770> usually<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.880> would<00:02:04.030> expect<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.509> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
see but usually one would expect it to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.380 
see but usually one would expect it to
be<00:02:04.750> just<00:02:04.780> flat<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.759> there's<00:02:06.759> detail<00:02:07.119> there<00:02:07.270> so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
be just flat but there's detail there so

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.800 
be just flat but there's detail there so
that's<00:02:07.509> really<00:02:07.600> cool<00:02:08.070> also<00:02:09.070> goes<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> peg<00:02:09.810> so

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
that's really cool also goes a peg so

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.090 
that's really cool also goes a peg so
you<00:02:10.899> could<00:02:11.019> attach<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.560> figures<00:02:11.709> belt
