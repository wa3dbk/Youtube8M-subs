obviously<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.380> depth

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
obviously and I think it's more in depth

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
obviously and I think it's more in depth
and<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.340> excited<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.659> can

and it's really really excited what can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
and it's really really excited what can
we<00:02:00.899> expect<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.100> more

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
we expect from that now that it's more

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
we expect from that now that it's more
in<00:02:02.429> depth<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.000> guess<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.929> explains<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.469> little

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
in depth I guess it explains a little

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.410
