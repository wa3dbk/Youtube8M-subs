00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 halo is again favorite time i have 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 In the last month a few products very much 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 very much used 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 I wanted to show it once and to it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 First of all, this belongs 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.650
 lipstick I'm wearing just the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.299
 I already have some videos 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 I believe in that and in that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.869
 first in which I have worn the da 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 have quite a lot in the comments below 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 written that he is very good to me 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
 and I agree 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.550
 that's where this is from betty 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 white the number 104 b 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.809
 the color rosebud i wanted you now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 and do not show 'cause I have this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 reddit whitehall but with the whitehall 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 I did not want to turn it off yet 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 actually also do so there are still 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 Much more products I have there now 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 so everything took away but this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.350
 So we have color from all of them 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 I think that's really great 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 be super nice mix of pink and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.840
 peach and you can see the color on each one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 case on the lips but it really is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 an incredibly beautiful female very 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 pretty feminine but I like her very much 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.539
 I really like it very much 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 really busy when I do that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 So you want a bit more handy 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 look at this color rosebud if you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.369
 somewhere near I know it 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 a bit difficult with this brand 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.920
 but this color alone filip 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 Is this brand worth it once 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 to look closer 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.790
 Then there is a lipstick 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 not really worn every day 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 if it should be natural but 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.909
 anyway, yes, if you are pretty anyway 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.829
 wanted to look then this was this one 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 from l'oreal from the privé collection 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.960
 heikes nude that's really mine 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.030
 dearest from this collection privera 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 so i love this color it suits you 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.560
 any make-up that suits any outfit 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960
 no matter which top part which color that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.729
 The lipstick fits that easily 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 So I think that is easy for me 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.030
 best of all i really have 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.320
 idolatrously loved and I will him 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 probably also the next 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.630
 months lie 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.520
 I still have the other colors in the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.869
 swatch video summarized that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 left was me down again then it can 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.909
 does not get all the other colors also 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.469
 look at it 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.079
 the next is something for the hair and 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.020
 from the kobe ​​the cuddly cat the anti 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.540
 frizz lotion for me is the product 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.270
 a multi-talented and I use that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.500
 always a half to full point bump 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 and then I'm doing this in here 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 Hair lengths pure 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 and that gives the hair some definition 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.370
 So I use is once to styling 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.310
 but also as heat protection it is 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.770
 also suitable and I think it has more 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.000
 Effect as a heat protection spray that 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.100
 it makes somehow hair 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 but if I have somehow I do 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.610
 yes the feeling that the hair better 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.560
 protected because I do not know of course 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.480
 If I have a picture but somehow 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.650
 the feeling is for the hair 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.420
 safer and the third function 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.730
 mass start is of course this anti 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.620
 frizz and there I have to say so would 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.240
 I do not use this product every day 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.090
 I used that at the beginning 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.220
 and then was very disappointed because mine 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.930
 Hair then started to fly 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.570
 because then they became extremely light and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.520
 very willing and annoying and therefore 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.590
 yes not suitable for every day but how 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.510
 said the style times here so the tips 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.280
 and also as a grant that's really 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.630
 a top product the next one is for 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.730
 the eyes are those eyeshadows 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.160
 palette of kiko the kaller impact 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.940
 eyeshadow palette in color 019 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.530
 swarm tons and that's the one out 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 this elf I do not know if she 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.030
 So yes, I'm showing you now 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.070
 dripping and I have to admit 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.330
 is that the very first eyeshadow 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.950
 range or even the very first 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.420
 I cover the kiko until now 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.760
 I do not have to say I am very 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.900
 surprised very positively surprised how 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.730
 I have seen a bit already 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.560
 really used for my relationships 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.209
 much so I have this month 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.280
 I only use this palette here 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.720
 and everytime I made videos 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.250
 then I had it on it too 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.920
 which sounds I like a lot 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 that's definitely here but this one 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.070
 dark brown mat is really good 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.170
 pigmented with that one can really great 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.010
 So work really intense 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.900
 brown tone then yes here is also very 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.060
 pretty and they are all very nice 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.640
 pretty the three here are dull and the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.560
 three here are cheap and yes it is 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.090
 really a very beautiful palette so 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.440
 I can absolutely recommend it if the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.390
 I still do not know though 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.769
 otherwise I will definitely still 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.180
 more eyeshadows by kiko 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.769
 Try it because this palette 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.390
 The next one is really convinced 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.489
 Product is also one of pico me 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.380
 that eyelash serum I have it 30 days 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.329
 long used but I will not extra 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.709
 review video to do so thought 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.530
 I'll put it in here now 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.810
 So it is not a great top product 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.220
 But it is not a super fast product 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.340
 is such a zwischending assist has his 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.050
 advantages so i had the feeling 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.720
 it does not make that eyelashes anymore 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.190
 she has it somehow yes 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.360
 root perhaps plugged and I know 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.010
 It is not in any case the eyelashes 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.169
 stayed there and are not anymore 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.240
 failed and thus had the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.260
 of course, the possibility continues to lash 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360
 to grow 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.470
 but they are not great either 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.300
 become very tall 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.830
 this should eventually have yes 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.240
 they stopped then they are 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.350
 just not grown any further I think 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.970
 that is also a bit on the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.810
 genetics that you just will not do anymore 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.729
 continue to grow 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.229
 that's why one side has it 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.030
 maybe it's done as well 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.500
 a little more volume is created because 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.810
 they will not be canceled anymore 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.570
 have become and a tick longer 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.000
 But it's just not great 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.260
 zoom effect has become one should 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So not too many hopes 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.560
 When you do this eyelash serum 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.090
 used here by kiko i know there is 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.130
 I can still count on other eyelashes 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.690
 not if they are so much better now 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.900
 or are they actually the same 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.910
 ingredients have but of kiko 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.410
 I think I do not recommend it now 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.130
 Then we come to the bronze now 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.870
 and if you already know me a bit 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.229
 Followed longer then you know that me 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.419
 Chanel idolatrously loved the zoo 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.889
 but I had already said then 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.539
 I find it for the winter months 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.130
 unsuitable and that's the reason why 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.200
 I had to dodge a bit now 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.600
 and I opted for the hula 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.220
 of benefit is great for 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.919
 contour so i find the color 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.050
 very pretty and featuring 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.190
 Of course something totally different 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.510
 So I had it now too 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.220
 not had and it really looks very 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.900
 Pretty, so I use it now 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.669
 to control and it works 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.590
 he really super good then I had too 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.010
 already this polish concealer from mac im 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.360
 shown last match and have since then 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.280
 I use it and I have to say it 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.870
 is really great so really lucky 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.700
 I always do that now so I do 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.110
 I have a small package then I do 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.240
 then always a point in and pure 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.979
 that always keeps it two to three times 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.620
 depending on how many I need 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.060
 for eye shadow nasal area and 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.650
 cheek area where everything is 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.300
 that wants to cover everything very well 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.530
 so i am very happy with that though 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.720
 you're still looking for one 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.340
 really good concealer then you can 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.070
 you really look at it i know it 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.950
 a little more expensive he is more cold 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.599
 but some people are really real 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.310
 good and your money would be the next 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.400
 product no surprise will be 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.990
 namely that he is loyal 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.030
 since I bought it and everyone 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.669
 I love it myself 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.710
 love it idolatrous for that yes 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.240
 this skin feeling makes you look as though 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.639
 I do not care for it anyway 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.280
 to look like I'm much prettier 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.980
 as I am and I just love it 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.240
 for making that effect and yes 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.400
 I know it's a bit more expensive 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.500
 but for me it was worth it this 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.750
 It is still not worth the price to pay 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.730
 high end product therefore so much 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.620
 it is not more expensive and for me it has 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.570
 Worth it is really great that 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.860

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.720
