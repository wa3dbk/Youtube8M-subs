00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and then before you start so on here you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
and then before you start so on here you
just<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.860> give<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> touch<00:01:23.909> over

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
just get this and give it a touch over

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
just get this and give it a touch over
before<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:25.909> often<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.170> that<00:01:28.170> keeps<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
before you start often and that keeps it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
before you start often and that keeps it
a<00:01:28.799> nice<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.520> Nick<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
a nice in good Nick yeah you can see the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.850 
a nice in good Nick yeah you can see the
blade<00:01:30.780> needs<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> bit<00:01:31.170> sort<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> shinier<00:01:31.740> than

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
blade needs a bit sort of shinier than

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.520 
blade needs a bit sort of shinier than
the<00:01:31.920> rest<00:01:32.130> yeah<00:01:32.549> okay<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> in

there with the Sheep is there a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640 
there with the Sheep is there a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
particular technique you're using I mean

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
particular technique you're using I mean
I'm<00:01:38.070> sort<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> holding<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> look<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.110> stab

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
I'm sort of holding it look at stab

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
I'm sort of holding it look at stab
someone<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.560> well<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.460> hold<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.609 
think he's just you know like a pair of
scissors<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.259> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
scissors but like what like this and but
