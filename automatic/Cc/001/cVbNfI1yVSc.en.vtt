match he's really gotta act quickly

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
match he's really gotta act quickly
though<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.250> he's<00:01:56.729> lost<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.119> lot<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.420> suvs

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
though because he's lost a lot of suvs

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.249 
though because he's lost a lot of suvs
and<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.549> he's<00:01:59.729> gotta<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.090> looks<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and and he's gotta get looks like to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
and and he's gotta get looks like to
race<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.790> for<00:02:02.790> mine<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.240> he<00:02:03.270> might<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.540> able<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
race up for mine but he might be able to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
race up for mine but he might be able to
defend<00:02:04.049> though<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> don't<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.399> have

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
defend though I don't think they have

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
defend though I don't think they have
cloaking<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.090> might<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.299> able<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> defend

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
cloaking so we might be able to defend

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.029 
cloaking so we might be able to defend
them<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.110> Marines<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.590> looks<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
them with Marines but looks like that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.260 
them with Marines but looks like that
tanks<00:02:08.280> getting<00:02:08.489> picked<00:02:08.670> apart<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> really

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
tanks getting picked apart you really

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180
