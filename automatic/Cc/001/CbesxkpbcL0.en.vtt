school because of this storm so that's
pretty<00:01:33.600> awesome<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.619> won't<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.920> power

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
pretty awesome but they won't have power

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
pretty awesome but they won't have power
so<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.490> can't<00:01:35.729> play<00:01:35.880> their<00:01:36.030> xboxes<00:01:36.630> maybe

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so they can't play their xboxes maybe

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.330 
so they can't play their xboxes maybe
this<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> generate<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
this you're going to generate or a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.429 
this you're going to generate or a
backup<00:01:38.670> generate<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.600> play<00:01:39.869> video<00:01:40.110> games

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
backup generate to play video games

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
much every generation always thinks that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
much every generation always thinks that
