before I go into it is take a shovel and
I'm<00:00:29.730> gonna<00:00:29.880> dig<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:30.150> sand<00:00:31.460> we're<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.580> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I'm gonna dig some sand we're going to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
I'm gonna dig some sand we're going to
be<00:00:32.730> able<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> same<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.390> evade<00:00:36.900> the

enough all right now there are a couple

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
enough all right now there are a couple
ways<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.300> one<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> go<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.259> through

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
ways in here one way is to go in through

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130 
ways in here one way is to go in through
here<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:11.550> putting<00:01:11.759> some<00:01:12.030> sand<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.690> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
here by putting some sand down and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.770 
here by putting some sand down and
making<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.500> step<00:01:14.240> there's<00:01:15.240> actually<00:01:15.569> another

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
making a step there's actually another

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.969 
making a step there's actually another
way<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.200> over<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:21.500> let's<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.649> if<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.860> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
way in over here let's see if we can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.490 
way in over here let's see if we can
find<00:01:23.280> it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.850 

going<00:01:30.500> here<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:34.899> we<00:01:35.899> will<00:01:36.049> go<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.409> as<00:01:36.560> will<00:01:36.710> go

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
going here and we will go in as will go

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.070 
going here and we will go in as will go
in<00:01:36.979> here<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.899> these<00:01:39.229> steps<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:44.450> here's<00:01:44.780> kind

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
in here and these steps and here's kind

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.810 
in here and these steps and here's kind
of<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.229> center<00:01:46.240> courtyard<00:01:47.240> chamber<00:01:47.930> here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
of the center courtyard chamber here

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.170 
of the center courtyard chamber here
right<00:01:49.820> under<00:01:50.149> this<00:01:50.570> area<00:01:50.869> here<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
right under this area here is the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.779 
right under this area here is the
treasure<00:01:54.170> room<00:01:55.030> now<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:57.530> blue<00:01:57.860> square<00:01:58.549> right

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
treasure room now this blue square right

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.639 
treasure room now this blue square right
here<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.479> like<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.929> center<00:02:00.319> of<00:02:00.440> why<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
here is like the center of why the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.529 
here is like the center of why the
treasure<00:02:01.039> room<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.659> now<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:02.720> could<00:02:04.330> dig<00:02:05.330> get

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
treasure room is now you could dig get

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.910 
treasure room is now you could dig get
out<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.899> try<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.080> go<00:02:06.229> down<00:02:06.409> there<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:06.679> there's

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
out and try to go down there but there's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.919 
out and try to go down there but there's
pressure<00:02:07.310> plate<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.909> sets<00:02:08.119> off<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.299> trap<00:02:08.690> at<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
pressure plate it sets off a trap at the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.620 
pressure plate it sets off a trap at the
bottom<00:02:09.319> of<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.590> chamber<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.209> safest

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
bottom of this chamber so the safest

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.190 
bottom of this chamber so the safest
thing<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:13.569> knock<00:02:14.569> out<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
thing to do is knock out one of the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
thing to do is knock out one of the
corner<00:02:15.650> things<00:02:16.100> right<00:02:16.549> here<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:19.519> then<00:02:19.730> we're

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
corner things right here and then we're

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.140 
corner things right here and then we're
gonna<00:02:20.030> go<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.480> we're<00:02:20.569> gonna<00:02:20.660> take<00:02:20.959> some<00:02:21.170> sand

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.300 

because<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:26.299> can<00:02:26.450> drop<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.930> sand<00:02:27.200> down<00:02:30.310> we're

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
because we can drop the sand down we're

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.949 
because we can drop the sand down we're
gonna<00:02:31.400> drop<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.940> till<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.239> fills<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.870> think

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
gonna drop it till it fills up I think

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.630 
gonna drop it till it fills up I think
it<00:02:33.109> takes<00:02:33.230> about<00:02:33.380> 10<00:02:33.940> things<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.180> sand<00:02:36.640> now

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
it takes about 10 things of sand now

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.110 
it takes about 10 things of sand now
let's<00:02:37.850> step<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:40.609> we'll<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:40.910> dig

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
let's step in here and we'll just dig

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.030 
let's step in here and we'll just dig
out<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> sand<00:02:41.660> from<00:02:41.840> underneath<00:02:42.170> us<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.620> Japan

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.370 

be<00:02:46.040> careful<00:02:46.370> not<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.670> step<00:02:46.940> off<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.959> actually

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
be careful not to step off it's actually

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.430 
be careful not to step off it's actually
not<00:02:48.940> deep<00:02:49.940> enough<00:02:50.209> for<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> kill<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.350> it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
not deep enough for it to kill you it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.090 
not deep enough for it to kill you it
will<00:02:51.560> take<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.769> lot<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.040> damage<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:55.010> you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
will take a lot of damage on you but you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.860 
will take a lot of damage on you but you
don't<00:02:55.340> want<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.640> risk<00:02:55.790> getting<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.299> pressure

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
don't want to risk getting that pressure

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.650 
don't want to risk getting that pressure
plate<00:02:57.910> we'll<00:02:58.910> see<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> second<00:03:01.390> put<00:03:02.390> another

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660
