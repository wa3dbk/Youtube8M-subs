00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.310 
for many years and I think they do a lot
of<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:44.390> wrong<00:03:45.390> they<00:03:45.870> could<00:03:46.049> do<00:03:46.170> them

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
of things wrong they could do them

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500 
of things wrong they could do them
better<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.190> thing<00:03:47.400> they<00:03:47.519> did<00:03:47.670> right<00:03:47.940> was

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
better but one thing they did right was

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.830 
better but one thing they did right was
to<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:49.140> cover<00:03:49.980> suicides<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.510> name

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
to not cover suicides and to not name

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.569 
to not cover suicides and to not name
people<00:03:52.230> who<00:03:52.320> had<00:03:52.410> committed<00:03:52.709> suicides<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.519> a

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
people who had committed suicides in a

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.180 
people who had committed suicides in a
public<00:03:53.940> way<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.110> as<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.560> glorify

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
public way this was so as to not glorify

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.150 
public way this was so as to not glorify
the<00:03:56.250> act<00:03:56.519> why<00:03:57.510> can't<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.989> be<00:03:58.260> applicable<00:03:58.739> to

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
the act why can't this be applicable to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.789 
the act why can't this be applicable to
mass<00:03:59.370> murders<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.269> mean<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.110> can<00:04:01.320> still<00:04:01.590> cover

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
mass murders I mean we can still cover

mass murders I mean we can still cover
the<00:04:02.010> story<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:02.459> do<00:04:02.579> we<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.060> identify<00:04:03.180> the
