00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
called el Ojo theanine which is heat

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.310 
called el Ojo theanine which is heat
resistant<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.329> that's<00:01:44.479> really<00:01:44.630> potent<00:01:45.259> at

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
well so okay important ingredient I'm

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.399 
well so okay important ingredient I'm
going<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.530> use<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.659> extra<00:01:53.659> virgin<00:01:53.899> coconut<00:01:54.549> oil

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
going to use is extra virgin coconut oil

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.190 
going to use is extra virgin coconut oil
now<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.470> can<00:01:57.890> use<00:01:58.130> olive<00:01:58.340> oil<00:01:58.579> if<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.509> want<00:01:59.869> to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
now you can use olive oil if you want to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.550 
now you can use olive oil if you want to
olive<00:02:01.040> oil<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.579> fine<00:02:01.969> to<00:02:02.390> use<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.869> cooking<00:02:03.079> if

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
olive oil is fine to use in cooking if

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.889 
olive oil is fine to use in cooking if
you're<00:02:03.680> using<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:04.040> little<00:02:04.280> bit<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.899> many

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
you're using a little bit of it many

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.340 
you're using a little bit of it many
plant<00:02:06.259> oils<00:02:06.680> when<00:02:06.920> they're<00:02:07.130> heated<00:02:07.670> up

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
plant oils when they're heated up

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.980 
plant oils when they're heated up
pitchers<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:09.460> hydrogenate<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.480> little<00:02:10.810> bit

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
pitchers can hydrogenate a little bit

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.520 
pitchers can hydrogenate a little bit
which<00:02:11.770> means<00:02:12.040> they<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.550> turn<00:02:12.910> partly<00:02:13.630> into

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
which means they can turn partly into

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.740 
which means they can turn partly into
the<00:02:14.650> bad<00:02:14.800> fats<00:02:15.100> we<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.520> want<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:16.300> olive<00:02:16.570> oil

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
the bad fats we don't want now olive oil

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.780 
the bad fats we don't want now olive oil
is<00:02:16.990> very<00:02:17.140> resistant<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.580> one<00:02:18.700> of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
is very resistant to this so it's one of
