 pet stores and the grouping of

 united lions made lions again 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.090
 reach the president of the congress of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 been again read a document with the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.290
 animal welfare initiative 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.420
 said initiative contemplates three points 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.879
 worrying that threaten our 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.400
 animals between your initiative 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.649
 These groups are trying to prevent NGOs 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.350
 rescue dogs from public roads 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.850
 street and then give them up for adoption 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.430
 eliminate unowned animals for 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.750
 that are not on public roads and 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.399
 relocate dogs that are foot of 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.340
 breed so they do not bother with their 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.899
 barking this is certainly a measure 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.700
 retrograde and that attempts against 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.399
 natural development of this species 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.110
 encourages racism and attentive violence 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 against the human values that our 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.100
 society requires for a healthy 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.289
 development and above all violent the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.509
 lacking legal rights in Mexico 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.760
 have granted our animals we are 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.909
 until the mother that they are harmed every 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.009
 more time 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.319
 minimal and basic facts that our 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.479
 animals require we demand from 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.119
 new lion authorities reject 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 forcefully this bestial initiative 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.619
 we demand that before approving 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 So screwed initiatives pass laws 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 of responsible pet ownership that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 regulate hatcheries that do nothing but 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.439
 encourage overpopulation and abuse 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.569
 animals in your state that regulate the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.609
 purchase of animals that approve 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.409
 laws that force pet stores 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.149
 to sell sterilized animals and that 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 promote tenure campaigns 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.039
 responsible for pets remember 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.929
 ruling lords that a nation can 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.539
 It is judged by how it treats 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.640
 your animals as a society we oppose 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.979
 to that this type of initiatives be 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.989
 approved and put in place we will be 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 very aware of the initiatives that 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.399
 approve and we remind you that this is not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 a matter of your state that thousands of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.420
 People who love and respect life 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.549
 of animals we are willing to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 give voice to those who do not have it already 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.209
 we are fed up with the growing abuse 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.549
 that is currently living in our 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.680
 society and that you as authorities 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.300
 are obliged to respond to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.580
 needs of a town to which 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 present that money and power are 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.950
 above the rights of the most 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.070
 vulnerable 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.900
 we insist as a society we oppose 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.340
 this initiative and we demand be 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.340
 flatly rejected
