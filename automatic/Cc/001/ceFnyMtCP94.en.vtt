pointless he's just going to switch the
alarm<00:01:03.530> off<00:01:03.710> now<00:01:04.580> what<00:01:05.000> we've<00:01:05.119> done<00:01:05.239> here<00:01:05.420> is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
alarm off now what we've done here is

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.980 
alarm off now what we've done here is
put<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.610> Clifford<00:01:07.940> on<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.210> switch<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.840> lock

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
put a Clifford on it switch to lock

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.020 
put a Clifford on it switch to lock
button<00:01:09.289> it<00:01:09.410> locks<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.680> doors<00:01:10.030> completely

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
button it locks the doors completely

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.160 
button it locks the doors completely
immobilizes<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.750> engine<00:01:13.479> if<00:01:14.479> anybody<00:01:14.869> does

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
immobilizes the engine if anybody does

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.870 
immobilizes the engine if anybody does
try<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.470> break<00:01:15.770> into<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.130> car<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:16.700> obviously

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
try to break into the car then obviously

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.480 
try to break into the car then obviously
the<00:01:17.240> Clifford<00:01:17.539> alarm<00:01:17.750> will<00:01:17.869> sound<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
the Clifford alarm will sound and the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.859 
the Clifford alarm will sound and the
Clifford<00:01:19.789> has<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.910> mobile<00:01:20.270> as<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.539> engine

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
Clifford has a mobile as the engine

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.749 
Clifford has a mobile as the engine
meaning<00:01:21.170> even<00:01:21.350> if<00:01:21.560> they<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:21.830> have<00:01:22.340> enough<00:01:22.550> time

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
meaning even if they do have enough time

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.490 
meaning even if they do have enough time
to<00:01:22.880> program<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.270> key<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.780> don't<00:01:24.410> go

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
to program a key and you don't go

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.080 
to program a key and you don't go
outside<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.010> investigate<00:01:25.159> while<00:01:25.729> your<00:01:25.850> alarm

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
outside to investigate while your alarm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.090 
outside to investigate while your alarm
is<00:01:26.240> sounding<00:01:26.689> they<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.680> be<00:01:27.830> able<00:01:27.920> to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
is sounding they will not be able to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.820 
is sounding they will not be able to
start<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.460> car<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.680> Clifford<00:01:30.680> will

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
start the car because the Clifford will

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.649 
start the car because the Clifford will
have<00:01:30.920> immobilize<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.520> engine<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:33.729> if<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:34.939> just

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
have immobilize the engine so if I just

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.890 
have immobilize the engine so if I just
demonstrate<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:37.119> Clifford<00:01:38.119> alarm<00:01:38.619> on<00:01:40.900> you

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
demonstrate here Clifford alarm on you

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.070 
demonstrate here Clifford alarm on you
try<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.259> start<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.670> engine<00:01:44.030> up<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.750> car<00:01:47.960> is

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
try and start the engine up the car is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.719 
try and start the engine up the car is
dead<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.530> obviously<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.920> alarm<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.280> sounding

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
dead and obviously the alarm is sounding

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.850 
dead and obviously the alarm is sounding
