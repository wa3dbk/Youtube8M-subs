00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
as far as an easy way of doing it I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920

the<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.590> top<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.879> map<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.420> constantly

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the very top of the map and constantly

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
the very top of the map and constantly
use<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.760> special<00:01:00.500> or<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.160> do

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
use your you know special or you can do

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this strategy which would maybe even be

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.300 
this strategy which would maybe even be
better<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> down<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
better if you can get it down now as the
