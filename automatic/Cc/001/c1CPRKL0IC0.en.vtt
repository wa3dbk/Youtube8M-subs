00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.800
 Selection Today is about the topic 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 control z1 the new controller mixa 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.940
 interface of native looks like this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 a packaging that is a bit bigger 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 as the usual of x1 or f1 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 the reason we same we see the whole 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 thing to open three look what 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.730
 the control z1 is included in the delivery 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.769
 latest trending from the home sewing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 peacefully settle next to the one already 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 known controller x1 or f1 is so 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.170
 just as big just as wide as deep 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.550
 So it can be wonderful for modular system 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 be used as it already 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 many have wished constructed as 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 2 channel mixer is but more plate 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 controller down behind fees from the layout 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.590
 ago 2 channel mixer at that time a small one 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 cross error 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.989
 we have 50 more alone errors relative 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.469
 straighten out a level indicator for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.120
 Channel a and b a filter function 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.079
 also for each channel exactly the same 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 like 1 3 band eq 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.110
 there is a gene regulator and a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 master level regulator and on top of that one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.030
 possibility to mix the headphones before 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.580
 to hear or to mix 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 installed is a 24 bit had verdi 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.200
 tractor knows the o2 will know there knows 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 not the instrument you are doing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 you can rely on that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.820
 sound is as good as it is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 the previously known interfaces 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 native there is a cinch output around 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 then this z1 at the club available in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.740
 mixer and stimulates the system 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 to join 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 there are no entries in the sense of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 microphones with some toro 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.790
 functions or record player connection 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.360
 or whatever you are looking for here completely 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 in vain 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 So it's not a fight with the senses 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.729
 There's no battle mixa either 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.939
 adjustable crossfire curve whatever 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 because now you wanted to miss praise it 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.560
 so there is only this cinch output 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.210
 there is a usb output, i explain 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.960
 Just what is on hold cable 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 there and there is one 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.430
 voltage supply that is also new 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 There was not at the time 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.549
 There is x1 or f1 on the other side 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.049
 a small jack output and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.869
 connect headphones and stop to 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.519
 hear 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.010
 that was in principle already so everything 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.569
 you can see this part here 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.870
 we'll see in the box purely what 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.910
 is supplied because there is one 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.720
 power supply that is new that is also 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.879
 Therefore, because of the Z1 to pick up with 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920
 a computer as well as an ipad 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.810
 or iphone can be used and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.250
 these sources will be equal to three 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.650
 supplied with voltage 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.569
 There is therefore also a USB cable 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.489
 lead calculator quite normally as you can 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.670
 knows reason a usb on 30 pin 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.590
 adapter cable for ipad 2 or 3 at 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.260
 ipad 4 again an adapter 30th 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.430
 lightning ipad 1 falls out because there is no 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.920
 16 for the ipad 1 there are still 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.660
 a few different other adapters 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.099
 Here at the power supply of the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.920
 to join the poorest of the country 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.230
 more interesting in germany yes that was 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.200
 it first of the size as I said 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 as big as the existing x1 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.410
 f1 and hence fits wonderful the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.600
 Part goes into these available bags 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.799
 there is already there for transport 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.000
 or yesterday 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.870
 somehow a little bit higher to point 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.790
 you can also use the stand for it 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.470
 So it's a wonderful starting point 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.940
 to make his motorcycle 189 euro 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.410
 costs the whole current and yes you can 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.540
 currently next to it then also wonderful 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.730
 imagine the f1 or the x1 or the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.430
 x1 mk2 comes because I think there know 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.530
 a month more 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.980
 it goes ahead the stay does not stand 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.849
 but they also have the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.760
 ipad apps around eye 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.959
 Of course, that will be something for some people again 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.250
 I'm sorry and he'll say that 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.470
 It does not matter what we have 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.500
 a new gram discussion there now 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.750
 no longer digital against analog or cd 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.370
 the opposite but it is then stop 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.349
 that's why dj controller went 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.290
 controller chip at prepare 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.519
 Get ready for the battle 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.519
 We'll listen to you again until 1
