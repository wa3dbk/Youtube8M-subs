narrow<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.479> opted<00:01:01.289> instead<00:01:01.409> for<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.979> DMR<00:01:02.550> v8<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
narrow I opted instead for the DMR v8 a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.010 
narrow I opted instead for the DMR v8 a
lot<00:01:04.080> better<00:01:04.290> grip<00:01:05.000> although<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.870> some

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

basic<00:01:07.460> platforms<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:09.090> aren't<00:01:09.330> too<00:01:09.480> bad<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
basic platforms these aren't too bad and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500 
basic platforms these aren't too bad and
they<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.250> reflector<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> comes

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
they do have the reflector that comes

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
they do have the reflector that comes
off<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.620> can<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:13.920> put<00:01:14.160> some

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
off so that you can actually put some

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.790 
off so that you can actually put some
cages<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:15.050> but<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.350> went<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.190> DMR<00:01:17.520> bas<00:01:18.800> again

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800

fast<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.660> what<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.870> was<00:01:57.990> wind<00:01:58.170> upgrade<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
fast which is what I was wind upgrade to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.310 
fast which is what I was wind upgrade to
okay<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.630> comes<00:02:01.230> with<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:03.020> pretty<00:02:04.020> narrow

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
bucks not going to be writing this so I

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.839 
bucks not going to be writing this so I
opted<00:02:09.840> instead<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.530> nice<00:02:10.769> foam<00:02:11.069> seat<00:02:11.370> kind

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849
