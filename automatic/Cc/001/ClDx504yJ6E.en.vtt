to send the printer back and buy me a

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.699 
to send the printer back and buy me a
different<00:03:27.989> one<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> should<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.500> gone<00:03:28.650> with

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
different one I should have gone with

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
the okidata

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.460 
the okidata
which<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.170> recommended<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.860> me<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:33.230> for<00:03:34.230> some

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
which was recommended to me but for some

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.000 
which was recommended to me but for some
reason<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.950> ended<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.489> Excel<00:03:35.880> Xerox<00:03:37.010> so

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
reason I ended up with Excel Xerox so

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.240 
reason I ended up with Excel Xerox so
but<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.910> will<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.420> now<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:40.410> for<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.010> guys

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
to and that seems to be a huge bomb that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.000 
to and that seems to be a huge bomb that
everybody's<00:03:45.120> asking<00:03:45.239> about<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
everybody's asking about is the the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.120 
everybody's asking about is the the
stick<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.400> wax<00:03:51.030> stick<00:03:51.530> even<00:03:52.530> though<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:52.950> is

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
stick the wax stick even though this is

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.840 
stick the wax stick even though this is
maybe<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.400> bad<00:03:53.989> print<00:03:54.989> right<00:03:55.170> now<00:03:55.430> if<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.700> would

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
maybe a bad print right now if I would

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.240 
maybe a bad print right now if I would
use<00:03:56.970> some<00:03:57.239> other<00:03:57.420> transfer<00:03:58.380> paper<00:03:58.650> maybe<00:03:59.100> it

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
use some other transfer paper maybe it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920 
use some other transfer paper maybe it
would<00:03:59.370> work<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.700> different<00:04:00.030> transfer<00:04:00.690> paper

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
would work the different transfer paper

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.190 
would work the different transfer paper
who<00:04:01.170> knows<00:04:04.820> will<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.000> perform<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> t-shirt

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
who knows will it perform on a t-shirt

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.240 
who knows will it perform on a t-shirt
so<00:04:07.829> if<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.280> take<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.060> lousy<00:04:09.660> print<00:04:10.590> now<00:04:10.799> put<00:04:11.160> it

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
so if I take this lousy print now put it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.890 
so if I take this lousy print now put it
on<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> t-shirt<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.209> gonna<00:04:12.329> spend<00:04:12.780> a

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
t-shirt I don't care

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.650 
t-shirt I don't care
burn<00:04:14.970> down<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.299> t-shirt<00:04:15.660> will<00:04:15.870> will<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.440> ink

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
burn down the t-shirt will will the ink

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.960 
burn down the t-shirt will will the ink
you<00:04:18.660> know<00:04:18.780> become<00:04:19.410> liquid<00:04:19.799> again<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.489> then

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
you know become liquid again and then

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.020 
you know become liquid again and then
we<00:04:21.209> mess<00:04:21.510> up<00:04:21.620> or<00:04:22.620> we'll<00:04:22.920> have<00:04:22.980> Easter<00:04:23.460> readable

and will it be usable maybe with the
other<00:04:28.590> heat<00:04:28.890> transfer<00:04:29.400> paper<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.720> would

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
other heat transfer paper and that would

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.390 
other heat transfer paper and that would
be<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.200> know<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.500> next<00:04:31.740> step<00:04:31.860> after<00:04:32.160> that

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
be you know the next step after that

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430 
be you know the next step after that
finding<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> right<00:04:33.120> heat<00:04:33.480> transfer<00:04:34.020> people

heat press transfer paper products would

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.570 
heat press transfer paper products would
have<00:04:46.020> been<00:04:46.140> nice<00:04:46.290> because<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.830> again<00:04:47.430> the

those cubes if I could get a printer
like<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:59.820> my<00:05:00.390> heat<00:05:00.720> transfer<00:05:01.200> products<00:05:01.770> I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
like that on my heat transfer products I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.810 
like that on my heat transfer products I
would<00:05:02.430> spend<00:05:02.700> extra<00:05:03.000> money<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.450> ink<00:05:04.230> or
