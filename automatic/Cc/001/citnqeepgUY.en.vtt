than poor so historically dirndl were in
darker<00:01:02.160> colors<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.180> hid<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> dirt

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
darker colors because they hid the dirt

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
darker colors because they hid the dirt
and<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.409> working<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> fields

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and when you're working in the fields

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.469 
and when you're working in the fields
you're<00:01:05.489> gonna<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.030> dirty

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you're gonna get very dirty

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450

so<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.080> browns<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> blacks<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.220> blues

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so there are browns and blacks and blues

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
so there are browns and blacks and blues
and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.240> they'd<00:01:09.390> wear<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.750> apron<00:01:09.960> over<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and then they'd wear an apron over it to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.140 
and then they'd wear an apron over it to
protect<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.159> dirndl<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.760> didn't<00:01:12.030> have

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
protect the dirndl so they didn't have

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.560 
protect the dirndl so they didn't have
to<00:01:12.270> wash<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.810> often<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.610> options<00:01:15.299> are

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to wash it as often now the options are

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
to wash it as often now the options are
limitless<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> decided<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:17.820> to
