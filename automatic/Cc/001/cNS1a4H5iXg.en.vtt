00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
my fears for black ops 2 I it seems like

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.280 
my fears for black ops 2 I it seems like
every<00:00:31.470> year<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.270> think<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> game's<00:00:33.960> gonna

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
every year we we think the game's gonna

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
every year we we think the game's gonna
be<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.770> thing<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> game<00:00:35.730> ends<00:00:36.030> up

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
be one thing and then the game ends up

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.690 
be one thing and then the game ends up
not<00:00:36.510> being<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.290> thought<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
not being what we thought it was that is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
not being what we thought it was that is
probably<00:00:39.210> gonna<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.750> biggest<00:00:40.050> fear<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
probably gonna be my biggest fear and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
probably gonna be my biggest fear and
that<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.160> something<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.760> wish<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.390> would<00:00:42.540> have

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that was something I wish I would have

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
that was something I wish I would have
really<00:00:42.870> realized<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.500> modern<00:00:43.980> warfare<00:00:44.160> 3

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
really realized about modern warfare 3

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
really realized about modern warfare 3
because<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> ended<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.420> being<00:00:45.660> probably<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because it ended up being probably the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.389 
because it ended up being probably the
biggest<00:00:47.070> problem<00:00:47.760> modern<00:00:48.510> warfare<00:00:48.660> 3<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
biggest problem modern warfare 3 in a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.150 
biggest problem modern warfare 3 in a
real<00:00:50.700> sense<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> balance<00:00:52.770> there's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
real sense it's kind of balance there's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
real sense it's kind of balance there's
not<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.699> lot<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.420> powerful

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
not a really lot of powerful

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.619 
not a really lot of powerful
overpowering<00:00:55.829> things<00:00:56.070> maybe<00:00:56.340> maybe<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> ACR

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
overpowering things maybe maybe the ACR

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.619 
overpowering things maybe maybe the ACR

that a lot of people are going to run
that<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:16.250> because<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:16.850> cheap<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.540> easy<00:04:17.750> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
that just because it's cheap and easy to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.979 
that just because it's cheap and easy to
get<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:19.340> next<00:04:19.880> one<00:04:19.940> would<00:04:20.270> be<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.630> hunter

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
kill streaks in the game I'm not really

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.880 
kill streaks in the game I'm not really
too<00:05:03.810> worried<00:05:04.170> about<00:05:04.320> them<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.590> mean<00:05:04.740> they're

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
too worried about them I mean they're

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.230 
too worried about them I mean they're
very<00:05:05.070> similar<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.490> what<00:05:05.640> we've<00:05:05.910> seen<00:05:06.060> in<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
very similar to what we've seen in the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.370 
very similar to what we've seen in the
past<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:07.520> I've<00:05:08.520> also<00:05:08.760> heard<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.380> these

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
past so I've also heard that these

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.740 
past so I've also heard that these
points<00:05:10.800> treats<00:05:11.070> their<00:05:11.490> score<00:05:12.390> streaks

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
points treats their score streaks

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.020 
points treats their score streaks
whether<00:05:13.130> keep<00:05:14.130> calling<00:05:14.430> them<00:05:14.460> point<00:05:14.760> streaks

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
whether keep calling them point streaks

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.540 
whether keep calling them point streaks
and<00:05:15.150> killstreaks<00:05:15.360> don't<00:05:15.780> these<00:05:16.410> core<00:05:17.100> streaks

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
and killstreaks don't these core streaks

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.060 
and killstreaks don't these core streaks
are<00:05:17.790> kind<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.120> harder<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.690> achieve<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.440> this

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
are kind of harder to achieve in this

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.040 
are kind of harder to achieve in this
game<00:05:20.370> then<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.300> have<00:05:21.480> been<00:05:21.600> used<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.870> in<00:05:22.020> the

game then you have been used to in the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.220 
game then you have been used to in the
past<00:05:22.140> I<00:05:23.150> personally<00:05:24.150> feel<00:05:24.690> like<00:05:24.750> I'm<00:05:25.110> not

getting scores I on my friends list I'm

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.980 
getting scores I on my friends list I'm
always<00:05:41.130> really<00:05:41.850> really<00:05:42.210> high<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.690> top

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
always really really high to the top

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.550 
always really really high to the top
when<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.500> comes<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.890> score<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:45.419> don't<00:05:46.350> see<00:05:46.530> it

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
when it comes to score I don't see it

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.890 
when it comes to score I don't see it
being<00:05:46.770> a<00:05:46.860> problem<00:05:46.890> I<00:05:47.520> get<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.210> lot<00:05:48.360> of<00:05:48.419> score<00:05:48.780> of

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
being a problem I get a lot of score of

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.150 
being a problem I get a lot of score of
whether<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.260> be<00:05:49.380> through<00:05:49.560> kills<00:05:49.860> or

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
whether it be through kills or

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.060 
whether it be through kills or
objectives<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:51.419> I<00:05:51.630> think<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.440> game<00:05:53.010> is

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
objectives so I think this game is

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.920 
objectives so I think this game is
really<00:05:53.370> going<00:05:53.640> to<00:05:53.790> play<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.030> my<00:05:54.240> strengths<00:05:54.750> at

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
really going to play to my strengths at

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.409 
really going to play to my strengths at
least<00:05:55.110> I'm<00:05:55.260> hoping<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:56.220> a<00:05:56.340> fear<00:05:56.640> is<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:57.270> I'm

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
least I'm hoping and a fear is that I'm

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.300 
least I'm hoping and a fear is that I'm
wrong<00:05:57.630> then<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.560> doesn't<00:05:58.800> play<00:05:59.070> to<00:05:59.130> my

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
wrong then it doesn't play to my

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.460 
wrong then it doesn't play to my
strengths<00:05:59.760> and<00:05:59.940> that<00:06:00.030> I<00:06:00.060> have<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.330> hard<00:06:01.260> time

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
strengths and that I have a hard time

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
very disappointed in it the version I

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.600 
very disappointed in it the version I
played<00:06:09.720> at<00:06:09.870> cod<00:06:10.080> XP<00:06:10.530> versus<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.100> version<00:06:11.460> I

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610

totally different animals and I'm

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.320 
totally different animals and I'm
worried<00:06:17.370> that<00:06:17.580> that's<00:06:17.669> going<00:06:17.910> to<00:06:18.000> be<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.150> case
