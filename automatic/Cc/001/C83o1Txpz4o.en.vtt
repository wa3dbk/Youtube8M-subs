00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to give it a little more FRA action I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
to give it a little more FRA action I
would<00:01:45.479> take<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> cheese<00:01:46.049> grater<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:47.340> one

that's all different size it and it's so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.589 
that's all different size it and it's so
random<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.159> works<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.450> I'm

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
random but it works so so well so I'm

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.449 
random but it works so so well so I'm
going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> smallest<00:01:52.500> side<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.369> I'm

just<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.819> to<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.030> ahead<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.539> take<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.959> top

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just going to go ahead and take the top

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
just going to go ahead and take the top
as<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> whole<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.399> grate<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:56.819> across

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
as a whole and just grate right across

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
as a whole and just grate right across

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and as you can see it starts fraying

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.660 
and as you can see it starts fraying
right<00:02:00.000> away<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.459> great
