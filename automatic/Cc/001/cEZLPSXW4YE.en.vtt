00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.920
 toss 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.540
 but it doesn't seem like any 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 the wrong one just we will have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:48.450
 absolutely randomly choose 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 just one three three 4 5 6 7 and 8 means 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.180

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 the first member of this for Ken yes until 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.510
 leha teams 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.430
 two representatives by the way on the park 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.600
 second member of my team and this 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 barrandov comrades ram minus more precisely 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 if you completely bring it to no one 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.360
 I know maybe this is not a minus but a dash 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.720
 dash well, let's see who will be Leh 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.000
 nuts us will be vavan which we long 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.159
 Time named Ilia in fact he 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.180
 van and such a good team is obtained 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 threw baths can and on selection 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.049
 who look to play a third party in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 I have my third party is rayman 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.640
 james old modelki ram by the way 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.119
 playing in a similar style will be a lot 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.939
 throws I think even though Candy Islands 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 entertainment is more important than performance 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.540
 because reiman and ram all 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 kindle knowing the team and have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.550
 in Lehi we smaug smauk good at 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 selection and so far it turns out that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.680
 Lehi's team makes up for the little 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.470
 a lot of big 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.050
 I apologize for the tautology so look what 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 we have the last person out of mine 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 teams this mori-san will be Vlad in my 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.740
 team this will be skype during 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.110
 he old kendo same vavan will 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.910
 skype have lehi 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.490
 and that is very interesting naturally here 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.830
 we have Kuroko tatsuya that is Hassan 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.050
 whiteside on whores whiteside will be in 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.910
 team light things will be three people in 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.410
 skype 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 it is also a kind of advantage but 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.040
 compensates small compensates 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 easy there are big there and here and there 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.010
 Well, in my team more such throwing 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.200
 players I think he is 2 keune 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 chief marshal 2 kendo 1 car main 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.820
 we will not have there is not the main thing 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110
 just the second match 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.850
 it is more difficult there to determine the composition 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.820
 participants but this is such a match 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.800
 legends and I hope that it will turn out 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.550
 very interesting and waiting for everyone when we wait 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.550
 Saturdays
