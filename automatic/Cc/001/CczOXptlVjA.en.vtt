and the effect on their bodies because

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
and the effect on their bodies because
lions<00:01:41.220> eat<00:01:41.400> meat<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> time<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> would

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
lions eat meat all the time so you would

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
lions eat meat all the time so you would
expect<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.970> crustacean<00:01:45.420> but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
expect them to have a crustacean but

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
expect them to have a crustacean but
they<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.250> know

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
they don't have that because they know

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.850 
they don't have that because they know
which<00:01:47.640> plant<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.240> go<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> eat<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.680> will

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
which plant they go and eat and it will

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.819 
which plant they go and eat and it will
ease<00:01:50.100> off<00:01:50.340> their<00:01:50.610> constipation<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> same

ease off their constipation the same

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
ease off their constipation the same
kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> process<00:01:53.549> happens<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.240> dogs<00:01:54.540> as

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
kind of process happens with dogs as

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.830 
kind of process happens with dogs as
well<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.890> dogs<00:01:56.130> pump<00:01:56.700> certainly<00:01:57.630> some

little bit of a diarrhea or a little bit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of vomiting certainly this doesn't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.860 
of vomiting certainly this doesn't
happen<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and usually it happens with those dogs

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.610 
and usually it happens with those dogs
which<00:02:17.220> don't<00:02:17.519> go<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.239> often<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.409> they

parks or in the wild and it's of course
there<00:02:25.440> are<00:02:25.470> certain<00:02:25.739> breeds<00:02:26.159> more

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
there are certain breeds more

there are certain breeds more
susceptible<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.250> would<00:02:29.250> call<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.790> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
susceptible to this I would call it a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.770 
susceptible to this I would call it a
problem

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
problem

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.670 
problem
so<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.040> commonly<00:02:32.489> see<00:02:32.849> this<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> adopted<00:02:34.470> dogs

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so we commonly see this and adopted dogs

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.890 
so we commonly see this and adopted dogs
when<00:02:35.370> someone<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.819> whiskey<00:02:36.329> a<00:02:36.360> dog<00:02:36.569> from<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
when someone go whiskey a dog from a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
when someone go whiskey a dog from a
shelter<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.560> dog<00:02:37.920> was<00:02:38.159> raised<00:02:38.489> all<00:02:38.819> of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.660 
shelter and that dog was raised all of
his<00:02:39.150> life<00:02:39.360> inside<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.019> house<00:02:40.319> not<00:02:41.099> used<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.519> go

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
his life inside the house not used to go

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.960 
his life inside the house not used to go
out<00:02:41.879> we<00:02:42.420> used<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.959> parks<00:02:43.799> or<00:02:44.010> wild<00:02:44.579> areas

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
out we used to go to parks or wild areas

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.759 
out we used to go to parks or wild areas
where<00:02:45.269> there<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.450> green<00:02:45.780> stuff<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.410> they<00:02:46.590> can

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
where there is green stuff and they can

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.610 
where there is green stuff and they can
eat<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.030> when<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.870> start<00:02:49.140> seeing<00:02:49.349> that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
eat it this is when we start seeing that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.030 
eat it this is when we start seeing that
problem<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> these<00:02:50.609> are<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.299> more<00:02:51.510> common

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
problem and these are the more common

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.300 
problem and these are the more common
category<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.730> dogs<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.569> people<00:02:55.410> which

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
come to us with this problem when it

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.220 
come to us with this problem when it
comes<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> dog<00:02:59.549> who<00:02:59.849> really<00:03:00.450> vomits<00:03:00.900> after

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
I would say check carefully because that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.210 
I would say check carefully because that
happened<00:03:43.049> with<00:03:43.169> me<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.530> saw<00:03:43.769> happening

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
happened with me and I saw happening

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.699 
happened with me and I saw happening
many<00:03:44.370> times<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.480> think<00:03:45.840> he's<00:03:46.019> not<00:03:46.049> eating<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
many times you think he's not eating it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.589 
many times you think he's not eating it
and<00:03:46.829> why<00:03:47.459> he<00:03:47.669> is<00:03:47.699> eating

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
and why he is eating

and why he is eating
so<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.319> best<00:03:49.500> thing<00:03:49.829> with<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.220> simplest<00:03:50.699> way

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
so the best thing with the simplest way

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.839 
so the best thing with the simplest way
to<00:03:50.910> check<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.480> check<00:03:52.139> his<00:03:52.349> toilet<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.980> he

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
to check this check his toilet and he

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.640 
to check this check his toilet and he
will<00:03:54.000> figure<00:03:54.209> out<00:03:54.359> right<00:03:54.750> away<00:03:54.959> from<00:03:55.139> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
will figure out right away from the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.309 
will figure out right away from the
color<00:03:55.889> or<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.250> constancy<00:03:56.669> of<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.269> F<00:03:57.690> if<00:03:58.109> he's

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
color or the constancy of the F if he's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.220 
color or the constancy of the F if he's
really<00:03:58.560> eating<00:03:59.040> grass<00:03:59.280> have<00:04:00.239> going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.139> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
really eating grass have going to the
