 gameplay I do not read too much cut 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.510
 frankly i did not make the guy like 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.550
 usually in Akoupé max gameplay 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.739
 just gia the second series I have a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.510
 little bit cut but otherwise you go 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.859
 have the three complete end series except 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.050
 the second the other two series 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.539
 will be complete wine well moufti 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.039
 whole gameplay of seven minutes good so 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.140
 here I really hope any case he 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.429
 you will like it and as for my 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.859
 little topic in fact it's simple I 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.479
 really improvised a thing of ouf know 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.790
 not what to look at finally I did not know 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.770
 what to tackle as a subject with you and there 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 I watched on YouTube videos at 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.890
 look you know I passed like this 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.250
 I did not even do it on purpose and I see 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.700
 tribute to anna my best friend or I 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.439
 do not know what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.259
 in fact I watched the video and I 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.090
 am saying here is the sight the friendship 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.079
 between girls and boys so I have a 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.759
 little bit of talking to you about that so I 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.079
 I'm really going to improvise 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.909
 give a little bit my ideas like that 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.079
 I noticed because to tell you 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.210
 I just watched the video 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.500
 Well, that impressed me because 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.390
 it's true that friendship between girls and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.369
 boys this is something that is 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.469
 just outstanding frankly I 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.180
 not you but if it's nothing 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.840
 better than having a fucking friendship 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.460
 with a girl 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.399
 it's a crazy thing I know 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.890
 I have a friend he has a friendship but of phew 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.990
 with a girl and it's really great 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.579
 but we must still recognize that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 it's pretty rare and I saw this 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.500
 video on youtube where actually the girl 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.320
 she was paying tribute to her best 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.960
 friend who is dead and well we see that they 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.359
 are super close and that's good we're going 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.799
 I do not have to hide it from you 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.179
 is racing on his back you see this 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.009
 the video to see in phew 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.539
 the busy is racing on his rate finally 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.400
 in short, that was just to mess with 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.100
 I reassure you because it has me 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.410
 really touched this video given 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.250
 that marveaux are really accomplices 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.660
 they are close 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.459
 she showed she was putting small 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 pictures of the little videos I do not have 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.319
 watched until the end because good 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 but here I looked 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.280
 a part is frankly it touched me 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.200
 and it's true I wanted to talk about that or 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.379
 passenger promised blocks his first 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.599
 dna good in two minutes the wave 2 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.510
 minutes not even finally brief 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.099
 and so is it for you 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.400
 possible friendship between girls and 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.230
 boys 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.540
 frankly I say clearly this is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.829
 possible proof is the proof the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.109
 video shows it 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.790
 I'm sure that even maybe you 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.769
 have a best friend me 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.849
 personally I tell you I do not have 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.980
 frankly I have no best friend 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.810
 I do not have a girl to whom I entrust all 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.870
 my secrets to be like that with who 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.639
 I have a complicity of phew all that g 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.489
 here are some friends with whom I am a little 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.819
 closer I like better than I like 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.769
 that's more than others but it's not 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.849
 here is a best friend you see 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 best friends is still some 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.510
 strong thing when you say best friend 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 it's not nothing you see even when you say 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.030
 a better friend know is that there is 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.040
 something you see and so here is 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.150
 is it possible for you? 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.590
 I think so so as I said 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.329
 clearly but after that it's true that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.799
 it is rare frankly it is rare 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.219
 not to hide good when you leave in 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.829
 vacation 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.419
 already we're going to tell you this thing we're going to 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.909
 say when can that happen 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.729
 see a best friend already there will me 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.449
 I tell you on vacation if it is too 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.069
 it's rare 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.930
 it will happen even I never think 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.000
 you already see basic when you come in 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.199
 vacation let 's take an example you'll 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.669
 at the campsite me this is where I go 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.379
 often on vacation this is where you 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.879
 encounters the world's most you see a 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.599
 stuff of phew not chicks guys 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.889
 the other I burst you and that's where 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.299
 we will take the example when you 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.549
 dating a girl you do not say I'm going 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.889
 to be best friend with her you see that 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.099
 already said it's your head is either you 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.750
 want to make you a little fun with or 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.769
 so you eventually want to be fair 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.870
 buddy do not you see what she can do 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.340
 to elect and be like that but it'll go 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.389
 no further do you see you say it's not going 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.280
 to be your best friend so already in 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.540
 more and more holidays in general the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.549
 vacation is never very long it lasts 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.349
 a week two weeks you go 1 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.909
 and then then you have kept yourself 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.109
 rarely contact except when you 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.729
 live the same life because it would 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.420
 con vacation when you meet 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.460
 people we live everywhere 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.890
 finally in different places so 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.120
 that we look at myself I was never 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.020
 kept in touch with people on vacation 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.730
 it's very very rare 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.380
 so frankly tell me in the 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.900
 comments guys if he confesses that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.970
 just happened to meet you there 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.070
 girl over time down a girl in 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.340
 vacation 1 it became your best 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.260
 friend 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.280
 I tell you I 've never seen that so 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.360
 frankly it would make me happy to see 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.720
 precisely of people to whom it is 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.610
 come 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.170
 must still and in my opinion for that 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.400
 happens the girl lives not too far from 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.740
 at home or because in general otherwise 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.670
 you never look at contact in me I 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.960
 you say it never happened to me 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.400
 keep in touch with who I met 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.890
 on holiday 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.350
 even guys a bit like this 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.340
 I did but it's 2 3 times and 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.880
 again these contacts 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.210
 a little hi time to time you see 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.680
 I think the best 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.970
 probability that's why it happens 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.620
 to have a best friend 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.950
 it's childhood friends ie 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.170
 when 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.060
 or you cantat was at his nurse's 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.630
 you were traveling was a girl calais your 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.980
 age with whom you laugh all that and with 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.440
 who you grew up somehow 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.650
 or so I know it's the example that 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.790
 I have and who for me has the best 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.710
 market somehow I have a little 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.060
 little trouble I bug it's actually 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.040
 simple these two parents who get 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.570
 knew the four actually 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.240
 really it's like a family choice 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.650
 and well the same four the six were 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.010
 and they all had 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.840
 children 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.550
 so they grew up together in the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.410
 even we were in kindergarten together 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.690
 finally France did not know too much 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.880
 very well but that's their parents getting 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.710
 knew very well and where it says 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.080
 three years they were in kindergarten 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.580
 together in primary school he 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.460
 lives next door in the same streets 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.110
 France therefore necessarily well here they are 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.850
 they do a lot of stuff together something 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.980
 crazy go skiing and frank 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.960
 frankly you have a sick friendship 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.090
 I see it between them 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.250
 impressive and so from inside they 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.560
 are two guys and a girl so that's it 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.050
 the fia a very strong link with one to one 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.820
 guys and I it impresses me that 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.850
 impresses me so I think that's it 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.020
 childhood friendship these scans better after 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.010
 there is also school it's true that 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.260
 school in general 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.090
 I know I was in private 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.320
 good for this pure college so for 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.520
 those who have been privately also 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.080
 I think you see a little bit of 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.000
 what I want to talk about and it's true that 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.050
 when you've been in private low when 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.390
 you spend your days 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.370
 if you do a class two classes three 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.680
 classes with the same person that's my 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.030
 instance a girl for example not 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.530
 necessarily it will create links because 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.420
 that in private you can not go out too much 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.250
 so you stay the day to eat not 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.570
 it is the recess together the courses so 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.630
 necessarily it creates something so 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.920
 for me here are the courses and the friendships 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.510
 of childhood and something just 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.820
 exceptional is where you necessarily 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.310
 can have links really very very 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.690
 strong with a girl and so here is so 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.860
 I'm done with my subject I hope 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.870

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.670
