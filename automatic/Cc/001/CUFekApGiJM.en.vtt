00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
okay it's been painted now I used a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.700 
okay it's been painted now I used a
system<00:00:06.450> three<00:00:06.980> polyurethane<00:00:07.980> paint<00:00:09.710> really

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
system three polyurethane paint really

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.299 
system three polyurethane paint really
nice<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.250> water-based<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.009> don't<00:00:14.219> have

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
nice it's water-based so you don't have

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.829 
nice it's water-based so you don't have
to<00:00:14.400> wear<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> mask<00:00:14.849> especially<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.719> you're

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
to wear a mask especially if you're

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.760 
to wear a mask especially if you're
outside<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:18.480> only<00:00:18.630> sand<00:00:19.050> thing<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> do

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
outside the only sand thing I had to do

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.730 
outside the only sand thing I had to do
was<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.310> rough<00:00:20.520> sand<00:00:20.820> between<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.740> resin

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
was just a rough sand between the resin

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.710 
was just a rough sand between the resin
and<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:24.060> coat<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> polyurethane<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:26.720> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and the first coat of polyurethane and I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.999 
and the first coat of polyurethane and I
did<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.199> coats<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.560> polyurethane<00:00:31.009> regular

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
did two coats of polyurethane regular

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.850 
did two coats of polyurethane regular
and<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.700> there's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.660> cross<00:00:33.960> linker<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and then there's a cross linker that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.110 
and then there's a cross linker that
goes<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> polyurethane<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:38.000> put<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
goes with the polyurethane and put the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.440 
goes with the polyurethane and put the
cross<00:00:39.360> link<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> last<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.550> coats<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
cross link in for the last two coats so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.000 
cross link in for the last two coats so
about<00:00:42.719> four<00:00:43.050> coats<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> polyurethane<00:00:44.719> and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
about four coats of the polyurethane and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.689 
about four coats of the polyurethane and
it's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> real<00:00:47.219> nice<00:00:47.460> paint<00:00:51.320> it's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> real

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
windows still not in there permanently

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.940 
windows still not in there permanently
but<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.310> work<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.850> somewhere<00:01:16.950> I'll

but got to work on that somewhere I'll
get<00:01:18.100> up<00:01:18.190> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.430> ladder<00:01:18.610> here<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.120> can<00:01:19.210> see

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
get up on the ladder here so you can see

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.800 
get up on the ladder here so you can see
the<00:01:19.450> roof<00:01:20.460> roof<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> same<00:01:21.940> way<00:01:22.150> put<00:01:22.570> four

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the roof roof is the same way put four

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:34.160 
the roof roof is the same way put four
coats<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:24.479> polyurethane<00:01:25.479> on<00:01:26.050> top

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.499 

I<00:01:34.290> haven't<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> fan-in<00:01:35.520> yet

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.450 

it's<00:01:40.960> going<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.259> two<00:01:41.619> strips<00:01:42.009> down<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
it's going to be two strips down the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's going to be two strips down the
side<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.450> roof<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:48.549> solar<00:01:48.820> panels<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
side of the roof for solar panels the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.859 
side of the roof for solar panels the
kind<00:01:51.700> that's<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.159> can<00:01:54.310> glue<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:57.869> there

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
kind that's that you can glue down there

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.130 
kind that's that you can glue down there
about<00:01:59.490> 16<00:02:00.490> inches<00:02:00.789> wide<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.330> about<00:02:01.390> nine<00:02:01.840> foot

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
about 16 inches wide and about nine foot

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.620 
about 16 inches wide and about nine foot
long<00:02:02.409> they're<00:02:02.979> meant<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.250> go<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:06.030> steel<00:02:07.030> roofs

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.750 

but<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:11.140> lot<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.410> people<00:02:11.709> use<00:02:11.860> them<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.130> rvs<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:12.730> I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
but a lot of people use them on rvs so I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.250 
but a lot of people use them on rvs so I
was<00:02:12.910> gonna<00:02:13.060> try<00:02:13.360> those<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.260> exterior

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
was gonna try those so all a exterior

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.620 
was gonna try those so all a exterior
painting<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:21.400> done<00:02:21.700> except<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.239> bottom

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
painting is done except for the bottom

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.759 
painting is done except for the bottom
part<00:02:22.739> I'm<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:23.799> going<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.100> use<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> cheaper

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
part I'm just going to use a cheaper

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.559 
part I'm just going to use a cheaper
oil-based<00:02:26.769> paint<00:02:27.069> for<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.569> this

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
oil-based paint for that this

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.400 
oil-based paint for that this
polyurethane<00:02:29.350> paint<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.739> expensive<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:31.410> 130

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
polyurethane paint is expensive it's 130

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.930 
polyurethane paint is expensive it's 130
140<00:02:33.010> dollars<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.489> gallon<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:35.430> well<00:02:36.430> worth<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.850> I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
140 dollars a gallon but well worth it I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.180 
140 dollars a gallon but well worth it I
think
