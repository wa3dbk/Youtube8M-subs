 he is only Sarthe 24 in the prime of age so for a ballet dancer and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.089
 Nevertheless, he will soon stop dancing 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.609
 because Terence Kohler has better things to do 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.009
 choreograph 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.889
 the young Australian is considered a great talent 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.980

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:22.589
 Birgit Keil and had brought him to her Academy of Dance in Mannheim

 For four years Polka fourth in their company danced at the Baden 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 Staatstheater Karlsruhe 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 he has already been celebrated for his negotiating partners, but now 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.680
 he tries on a smaller piece 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.540
 to the ballet evenings eternal problem agile Rome the morning has premiere 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.179
 Szczecin was not in the least Terence Kohler in Rome 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.010
 not us either 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.460
 as long as the result is correct 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 Nicolai Liachowitsch visited Terence Kohler during the last rehearsals 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.280
 Stone or not 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.160
 Cupid and psyche dance 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.880
 a marble statue falls out of the frame 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.280
 and Intel is in Lingen 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 Konstanz as the goal of Chancellor Werner Millions 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.930
 Köhler 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 if deep people Hans Kuhn as the youngest Cologna is much for his 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.429
 Company of the Karlsruhe Ballet 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.429
 by himself also dancing 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.980
 as choreographer David Hemmings Kohler with his 24 years still 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.240
 Consolation considered as a round child 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.380
 for fini to have counts for the potential 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.410
 they should have got that 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.310
 to meet the right people in the right place at the right time 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.900
 Producing under such circumstances is the passion of Birgit Keil 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.160
 Lucia for the benefit of Terence Kohler 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.030
 in the holding change from the dancer and a dancer to the Cologna 5 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 not difficult 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.790
 harbors traitors we understand ours great 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.879
 Colleagues have great respect for my work and I am very happy about that 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.200
 gratefully ideal, of course, a little dance with her will be happy 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.829
 Difficult and now if the talk then happy room game shares 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.950
 but we do not yet quantify it, especially since we have been there for a while now 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.659
 have been together here in Karlsruhe for five years and many have been to 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.199
 Academy of Dance poorer countries reject it is almost a quarter than go 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.199
 We grew up together around the ticket with green tea Ston 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.039
 grow up together 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.439
 that was not arm of highlights 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.620
 The biggest sensation was caused by Tanzkurs's first full-length ballet Anna 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:46.490
 Karenina 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 that he choreographed in Karlsruhe at the age of 21 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.969
 another big action ballet followed 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.439
 With anti-flag 1 Kohler is looking for a new direction 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.229
 a monitor demos and Hengersberg 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.339
 I wanted to do something more spontaneously, so what did I do for six couples? 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.199
 decided what in principle that always means in three people in the ballet room 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.849
 working for the particular couple and i hated seckendorff i wanted 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.779
 choreographically advancing leads to a man with 30 people 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.029
 works then one is sometimes trouble with the control of crowds 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:22.059
 Employed as a duck choreographer actually Prom I wanted everything 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.629
 Alcoa thus reduces the workload of people so that they should daily and one day 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.629
 are pretty very important Amberg with people 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.809
 you have to drive yourself out of the comfort zone 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.239
 to move forward, says Kohler 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.080
 Potash 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.890
 does he have with his new piece nobody will be able to say he is leaving 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.719
 get on Kölsch and come 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.559
 for the duty of peace intense form seek between classical 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.859
 movement repertoire 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.889
 and modern content 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.439
 the language of the dance does not have to be reinvented, "he said 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.439
 you just have to have something new to say 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:09.300
 I think TLZ one 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.059
 great imagination 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.669
 a big kink the must 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.549
 and can both tell stories 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.549
 as well as create abstract works 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.120
 and there is not very nice and extraordinary children and Brian 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.529
 I am in mine too 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:30.400
 Time with the Stuttgart Ballet which was especially creative 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.139
 the Arbon 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.909
 Having met with basket hit then went to all the world 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:37.419
 around 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.050
 He tests the project together with his young colleagues at the university 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.210
 in the Academy of Dance 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.319
 or here now in the Korso company previously common beside his 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.520
 peers 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.639
 he wants new elections 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.819
 how far Terence Kohler and his dancers have grown 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 the premiere morning the test shows 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.430
