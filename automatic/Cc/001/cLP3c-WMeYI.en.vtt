go<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.820> big<00:02:36.120> eye<00:02:39.019> relative<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> side

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
go with the big eye relative to the side

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.580 
go with the big eye relative to the side
of<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.769> head<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.690> bigger<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> eye<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
of the head so the bigger the eye the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.059 
of the head so the bigger the eye the
cure<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.440> animal<00:02:47.120> generally<00:02:48.120> will<00:02:48.299> be

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.339 

so<00:02:53.069> placement<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.879> eyes<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.510> important<00:02:55.019> on

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
so placement of the eyes is important on

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.460 
so placement of the eyes is important on
how<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.950> your<00:02:56.159> creature<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.970> look<00:02:57.120> like

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
how you want your creature to look like

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.059 
how you want your creature to look like
so<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.370> making<00:02:59.579> my<00:02:59.849> dragons<00:03:00.650> very<00:03:01.650> very

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
so I like making my dragons very very

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.179 
so I like making my dragons very very
sinister<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.470> mean-looking<00:03:04.470> when<00:03:04.980> there<00:03:05.129> are

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
sinister and mean-looking when there are

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.039 
sinister and mean-looking when there are
full-sized<00:03:05.640> adults<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> had<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:08.780> figure<00:03:09.780> out

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
full-sized adults so I had to figure out

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.380 
full-sized adults so I had to figure out
what<00:03:10.890> they<00:03:11.010> look<00:03:11.189> like<00:03:11.220> when<00:03:12.090> they're<00:03:12.209> babies

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
what they look like when they're babies

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.910 
what they look like when they're babies
and<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:15.180> course<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.689> wanted<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.019> make<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.500> cute

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and of course I wanted to make them cute

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.830 
and of course I wanted to make them cute
enough<00:03:17.129> so<00:03:17.489> they<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.849> interact<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.329> humans

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
enough so they can interact with humans

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.059 
enough so they can interact with humans
and<00:03:21.109> you<00:03:22.109> know<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.440> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.739> helps<00:03:22.980> to

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
and you know that kind of helps to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.149 
and you know that kind of helps to
develop<00:03:23.310> their<00:03:23.700> personalities<00:03:24.180> also<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> think

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.890 

when<00:03:32.159> I<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.430> lot<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.730> conflict<00:03:33.120> characters<00:03:33.599> I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
when I do a lot of conflict characters I

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.399 
when I do a lot of conflict characters I
do<00:03:34.049> tend<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.400> try<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.269> make<00:03:36.480> them<00:03:36.689> a<00:03:36.989> little

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
do tend to I try to make them a little

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.920 
do tend to I try to make them a little
bit<00:03:37.500> more<00:03:37.680> real<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.159> my<00:03:38.310> mind<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.689> try<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
bit more real in my mind and I try to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.399 
bit more real in my mind and I try to
roleplay<00:03:40.290> with<00:03:40.709> them<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.220> figure<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:42.409> what

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
roleplay with them and figure out what

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.449 
roleplay with them and figure out what
they<00:03:43.650> might<00:03:43.829> do<00:03:44.040> how<00:03:44.459> they<00:03:44.790> behave<00:03:45.590> because<00:03:46.590> if

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
they might do how they behave because if

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.699 
they might do how they behave because if
your<00:03:47.700> characters<00:03:48.120> ever<00:03:48.359> go<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:49.159> cartoon<00:03:50.900> or<00:03:51.900> TV

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
your characters ever go to cartoon or TV

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.689 
your characters ever go to cartoon or TV
or<00:03:52.739> film<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:54.769> if<00:03:55.769> you're<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.099> originator<00:03:56.609> of

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
or film and if you're the originator of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.670 
or film and if you're the originator of
that<00:03:57.090> character<00:03:57.629> you<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.169> want<00:03:58.349> to<00:03:58.440> be<00:03:58.560> able

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
that character you you want to be able

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.789 
that character you you want to be able
to<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> expert<00:03:59.639> person<00:04:00.569> on<00:04:01.019> how<00:04:01.560> that

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
to be the expert person on how that

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.610 
to be the expert person on how that
character<00:04:02.069> behaves

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
character behaves

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.830 
character behaves
it<00:04:05.610> also<00:04:05.760> makes<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.569> good

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
it also makes for really good

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.690 
it also makes for really good
storytelling<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:09.540> knowing<00:04:10.519> what<00:04:11.519> your

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
storytelling just knowing what your

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.189 
storytelling just knowing what your
characters<00:04:12.150> are<00:04:12.269> going<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.569> do<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.810> wing

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
characters are going to do so that wing

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.370 
characters are going to do so that wing
was<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:17.160> bit<00:04:17.250> too<00:04:17.430> large<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.959> erased

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
was a little bit too large so I erased

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:32.600 
was a little bit too large so I erased
it<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.829> I'm<00:04:20.400> rebuilding

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.080 

so<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> pretty<00:04:33.900> much<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:34.879> draw<00:04:35.879> everything

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so I pretty much just draw everything

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.170 
so I pretty much just draw everything
from<00:04:36.449> memory<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.310> when<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.370> draw<00:04:38.550> dragons<00:04:39.060> I

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
from memory and when I draw dragons I

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.140 
from memory and when I draw dragons I
try<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:40.039> reference<00:04:41.039> back<00:04:41.819> wings<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.659> lot<00:04:44.150> since

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
try to reference back wings a lot since

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.700 
try to reference back wings a lot since
they're<00:04:45.360> very<00:04:45.539> similar<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.169> would<00:04:46.349> reagan's

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
they're very similar to would reagan's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.600 
they're very similar to would reagan's
dragon<00:04:47.159> wings<00:04:47.340> might<00:04:47.610> look<00:04:47.789> like<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:49.610> their

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
dragon wings might look like and their

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.080 
dragon wings might look like and their
physical<00:04:50.819> structure<00:04:51.509> of<00:04:51.539> bat<00:04:52.050> wings<00:04:53.090> are

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
physical structure of bat wings are

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.550 
physical structure of bat wings are
course<00:04:54.810> proven<00:04:55.319> obviously<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:57.539> create<00:04:58.469> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
course proven obviously to create the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.119 
course proven obviously to create the
ability<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:59.099> fly<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.840> make<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:02.039> the

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
ability to fly so make that on the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.180 
ability to fly so make that on the
bigger<00:05:02.370> scale<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:03.680> dragon<00:05:04.680> wings<00:05:04.830> should<00:05:05.069> be

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
bigger scale and dragon wings should be

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.540 
bigger scale and dragon wings should be
pretty<00:05:05.430> similar<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:06.300> bat<00:05:06.780> wings

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.490 

and<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.210> course<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.660> double<00:05:13.020> dragon<00:05:13.379> that

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
and of course this double dragon that

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.170 
and of course this double dragon that
I'm<00:05:13.590> drawing<00:05:13.860> right<00:05:14.069> here<00:05:14.099> is<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.669> Western

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
I'm drawing right here is the Western

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.650 
I'm drawing right here is the Western
dragon<00:05:15.629> where<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.979> four<00:05:17.729> feet<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.330> two

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
dragon where you have four feet and two

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:33.870 
dragon where you have four feet and two
wings

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.909 

I'm<00:05:34.880> just<00:05:35.120> doing<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.510> little<00:05:35.660> bit<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:35.990> extra<00:05:36.380> a

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
I'm just doing a little bit of extra a

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.290 
I'm just doing a little bit of extra a
heavy<00:05:37.280> line<00:05:37.550> work<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:39.680> make<00:05:39.889> my<00:05:40.100> main<00:05:40.850> outline

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
heavy line work to make my main outline

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.890 
heavy line work to make my main outline
of<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.540> dragon<00:05:41.870> stand<00:05:42.139> out

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.500 

so<00:05:48.900> here<00:05:49.110> I'm<00:05:49.169> correcting<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.740> tale<00:05:50.510> again

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
so here I'm correcting the tale again

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.540 
so here I'm correcting the tale again
the<00:05:51.900> initial<00:05:52.200> sketch<00:05:52.710> lines<00:05:52.980> were<00:05:53.250> just<00:05:53.400> a

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
the initial sketch lines were just a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.500 
the initial sketch lines were just a
guide<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:54.720> where<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:54.930> wanted<00:05:55.500> tale<00:05:56.040> to<00:05:56.340> be<00:05:56.550> but

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
guide to where I wanted tale to be but

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.940 
guide to where I wanted tale to be but
I'm<00:05:57.690> adjusting<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.380> as<00:05:58.500> I<00:05:58.680> go<00:06:00.380> and<00:06:01.380> again<00:06:01.770> I'm

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
I'm adjusting it as I go and again I'm

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.710 
I'm adjusting it as I go and again I'm
not<00:06:01.980> too<00:06:02.220> worried<00:06:02.520> about<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.820> details<00:06:03.270> of

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
not too worried about the details of

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.350 
not too worried about the details of
machining<00:06:04.440> because<00:06:05.220> it's<00:06:05.430> just<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.730> sketch<00:06:06.060> and

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
machining because it's just a sketch and

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.230 
machining because it's just a sketch and
I'm<00:06:07.169> treating<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.830> as<00:06:08.040> a<00:06:08.070> sketch<00:06:08.520> and<00:06:09.320> later<00:06:10.320> on

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
I'm treating it as a sketch and later on

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.610 
I'm treating it as a sketch and later on
this<00:06:12.240> sketch<00:06:12.570> will<00:06:12.750> actually<00:06:13.020> turn<00:06:13.260> into<00:06:13.410> a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
this sketch will actually turn into a

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.409 
this sketch will actually turn into a
really<00:06:13.889> nice<00:06:14.130> drawing<00:06:14.639> where<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.120> shading

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
really nice drawing where the shading

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.730 
really nice drawing where the shading
will<00:06:15.720> be<00:06:16.850> done<00:06:17.850> a<00:06:17.880> lot<00:06:18.150> better<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:19.440> dragon

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
will be done a lot better the dragon

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.879 
will be done a lot better the dragon
won't<00:06:19.800> have<00:06:19.979> detail<00:06:21.229> wealthy<00:06:22.229> lighten<00:06:22.620> and

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
won't have detail wealthy lighten and

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.690 
won't have detail wealthy lighten and
dark<00:06:23.190> areas<00:06:23.870> drawing<00:06:24.870> and<00:06:25.800> I'll<00:06:26.460> create

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
dark areas drawing and I'll create

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.149 
dark areas drawing and I'll create
another<00:06:26.940> video<00:06:27.229> based<00:06:28.229> on<00:06:28.380> this<00:06:28.560> sketch

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.129 

and<00:06:33.159> again<00:06:33.460> some<00:06:33.849> more<00:06:33.960> hatching<00:06:34.960> and

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
and again some more hatching and

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.619 
and again some more hatching and
cross-hatching<00:06:35.169> technique<00:06:36.300> just<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.419> create

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:37.629 
cross-hatching technique just to create

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:43.790 
cross-hatching technique just to create
the<00:06:37.750> shadows<00:06:40.469> and<00:06:41.909> one<00:06:42.909> of<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.090> reasons<00:06:43.419> I

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
the shadows and one of the reasons I

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.980 
the shadows and one of the reasons I
really<00:06:44.800> advocate<00:06:45.430> using<00:06:46.270> hatching<00:06:46.840> technique

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
really advocate using hatching technique

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.070 
really advocate using hatching technique
is<00:06:47.469> because<00:06:47.949> it's<00:06:48.370> a<00:06:48.490> quick<00:06:48.789> method<00:06:49.000> at<00:06:49.840> least

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
is because it's a quick method at least

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.809 
is because it's a quick method at least
for<00:06:50.259> me<00:06:50.439> you<00:06:51.300> just<00:06:52.300> quickly<00:06:53.050> blade<00:06:53.469> down<00:06:53.819> areas

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
for me you just quickly blade down areas

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.260 
for me you just quickly blade down areas
of<00:06:54.969> shadow<00:06:55.180> or<00:06:55.870> fill<00:06:56.289> an<00:06:56.439> area<00:06:56.949> to<00:06:57.789> give<00:06:57.969> a<00:06:58.000> tone

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
of shadow or fill an area to give a tone

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.899 
of shadow or fill an area to give a tone
on<00:06:58.509> color<00:06:58.780> just<00:06:59.710> do<00:06:59.860> some<00:07:00.039> hatching<00:07:00.400> lines<00:07:00.520> and

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:00.909 
on color just do some hatching lines and

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.450 
on color just do some hatching lines and
then<00:07:01.330> you'll<00:07:01.509> be<00:07:01.539> done<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:02.830> you<00:07:02.889> can<00:07:03.069> continue

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
then you'll be done so you can continue

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.129 
then you'll be done so you can continue
on<00:07:03.610> with<00:07:03.639> the<00:07:03.940> sketch<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:04.539> flush<00:07:04.780> out<00:07:04.960> your

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
on with the sketch and flush out your

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:05.969 
on with the sketch and flush out your
idea

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
idea
