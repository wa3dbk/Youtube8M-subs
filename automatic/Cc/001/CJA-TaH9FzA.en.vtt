00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 to fill up on carbohydrates and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.970

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.610
 rosemary 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.320
 at first glance they might seem like gods 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 simple parini but already after the first one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 bite you will discover the true e 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 the potato is its delicacy 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.750
 protagonist ingredient of this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 recipe in addition to making a lot more 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 soft the bread will exalt the taste for 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 get some wonderful firsts 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.160
 rustic we discover dose together 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.730
 ingredients to prepare 4 balls per 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.930
 potatoes are required 250 g of flour 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 manitoba 13 grams of brewer's yeast 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.870
 an average potato about 130 grams 5 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 grams of granulated sugar 2 tbsp 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 of extra virgin olive oil then again 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 4 grams of salt up to a tablespoon of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 rosemary and then to finish clearly 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 enough water 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 we are about 140 mm now that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.539
 we have dissolved the yeast we can 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.229
 then proceed with the dough 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.960
 we crush the potatoes with ours 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.290
 close here it is the potatoes mi 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.250
 I recommend they must still be hot 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.600
 rather hot because in short 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 otherwise the potato will make lumps 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 very well and now add the salt then 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.259
 still the rosemary and a little we keep them 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.189
 aside because we will spread it over the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.049
 our loaves mix like this 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.119
 mix all the ingredients a little 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 ingredients we pour the water and the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.820
 yeast with sugar 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.820
 we mix and add the oil too 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.119
 I advise you to always keep by 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.610
 in short, some flour by chance 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.610
 we needed it now we knead 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.320
 here we got a nice one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.380
 dough ball and now let's move on 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.880
 one after the other with flour 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.580
 we also sport the knife with the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.330
 now we have four pieces of flour 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.140
 perfect 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:25.319
 in fact I am rather regular and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:29.489
 now every bit we make one 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.989
 so a simple and then the audience 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.190
 let's rise on the rope pitch 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.190
 clearly lined with wax paper 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.319
 we have placed our balls of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 well spaced dough on the cards e 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.800
 now we let them rise about 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.090
 an hour and an hour and a half until 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.650
 when they become beautiful chubby 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.170
 spent about an hour ours 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 loaves are already ready for it as 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.850
 do you have to take a little air out 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.510
 then we go gently with our hands 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:10.790
 to crush them slowly so we do 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.320
 the same operation in all perfect 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.769
 not too not so flattened and 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.480
 overly these my sandwiches 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.610
 require a double leavening 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.860
 so they are practically ready from 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.400
 cook in his own with a knife 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.359
 let's go to make some lines for 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 give the shape of a turtle 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:36.019
 then clearly you can have fun giving 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.019
 the shape you like best 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.090
 and now some rosemary over me 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.549
 I recommend you already turn the oven on at 190 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 degrees so that when you go to 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:52.500
 bake already knows how nice it is 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.790
 perfect then 190 degrees for about 15 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 minutes 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.079
 this rustic bread with hyper potatoes 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.329
 soft and ideal to surprise 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.220
 your guests in the middle of a dinner 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.470
 important maybe with meat or 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.540
 better still than the goulash or 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.129
 normal stew or these 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.510
 loaves are ideal to be 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.189
 stuffed 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.010
 of the raw and rocket or simply 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.060
 with grilled vegetables with tofu 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.060
 for a vegan dive
