00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
then you're just going to roll it into

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.179 
then you're just going to roll it into
kind<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.780> rose<00:03:06.109> shape<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:06.620> then<00:03:07.069> you're

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
kind of a rose shape and then you're

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.619 
kind of a rose shape and then you're
gonna<00:03:07.310> slice<00:03:07.840> half<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.799> like<00:03:10.069> that

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
gonna slice half of that so like that

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.330 
gonna slice half of that so like that
then<00:03:11.629> once<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.439> now<00:03:13.069> you're<00:03:13.189> going

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
then once you have that now you're going

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.129 
then once you have that now you're going
to<00:03:13.400> cut<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:13.849> on<00:03:14.060> piece<00:03:14.329> in<00:03:14.540> half<00:03:14.689> and<00:03:14.959> then

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
to cut the on piece in half and then

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.740 
to cut the on piece in half and then
you'll<00:03:15.290> have<00:03:15.439> two<00:03:15.709> roses<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.549> don't<00:03:17.269> worry<00:03:17.510> if

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
you'll have two roses and don't worry if

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.330 
you'll have two roses and don't worry if
it<00:03:17.870> looks<00:03:18.049> crappy<00:03:18.319> because<00:03:18.560> mine<00:03:18.859> does<00:03:19.099> and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
it looks crappy because mine does and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.119 
it looks crappy because mine does and
I'm<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:19.549> really<00:03:19.669> taking<00:03:19.909> my<00:03:20.060> time<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:21.129> yours

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
I'm not really taking my time but yours

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.170 
I'm not really taking my time but yours
would<00:03:22.280> probably<00:03:22.579> look<00:03:22.669> better<00:03:22.849> than<00:03:23.090> mine

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
would probably look better than mine

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.440 
would probably look better than mine
anyways<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:24.669> remember<00:03:25.669> this<00:03:25.909> is<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> be

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
anyways and remember this is going to be

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.869 
anyways and remember this is going to be
small<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:28.129> doesn't<00:03:28.370> have<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.579> look<00:03:28.609> perfect

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
small so it doesn't have to look perfect

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.399 
small so it doesn't have to look perfect
because<00:03:29.450> no<00:03:29.719> one's<00:03:29.870> really<00:03:30.049> going<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.319> take

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
because no one's really going to take

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.929 
because no one's really going to take
their<00:03:30.530> time<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.769> actually<00:03:31.159> see<00:03:31.669> if<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.879> a

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
their time to actually see if it's a

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.220 
their time to actually see if it's a
real<00:03:32.090> rose<00:03:32.269> then<00:03:32.750> you're<00:03:32.840> gonna<00:03:32.930> take<00:03:33.049> some

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
real rose then you're gonna take some

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.530 
real rose then you're gonna take some
dark<00:03:33.379> green<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.919> all<00:03:34.069> three<00:03:34.430> greens<00:03:34.909> and<00:03:35.359> then

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
dark green and all three greens and then

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.110 
dark green and all three greens and then
you're<00:03:35.689> just<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.229> mix<00:03:36.590> them<00:03:36.829> together

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
you're just going to mix them together

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.030 
you're just going to mix them together
like<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.720> don't<00:03:38.930> mix<00:03:39.079> them<00:03:39.290> fully<00:03:39.590> just

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
like so and don't mix them fully just

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.250 
like so and don't mix them fully just
mix<00:03:40.310> them<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.729> the<00:03:40.849> point<00:03:41.180> where<00:03:41.959> they're

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
mix them to the point where they're

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.430 
mix them to the point where they're
gonna<00:03:42.500> kind<00:03:42.889> of<00:03:42.949> look<00:03:43.840> British<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.079> that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
gonna kind of look British like that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.429 
gonna kind of look British like that
and<00:03:46.120> then<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.329> kind<00:03:47.479> of<00:03:47.599> see<00:03:47.750> swirls<00:03:48.139> inside

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
and then you kind of see swirls inside

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.390 
and then you kind of see swirls inside
and<00:03:48.590> then<00:03:48.680> you're<00:03:48.799> just<00:03:48.859> gonna<00:03:48.979> roll<00:03:49.189> it<00:03:49.280> into

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
and then you're just gonna roll it into

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.210 
and then you're just gonna roll it into
a<00:03:49.519> ball<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.030> now<00:03:50.599> it's<00:03:51.379> time<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:51.769> take<00:03:52.189> your

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
a ball and now it's time you take your

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.309 
a ball and now it's time you take your
glass<00:03:52.760> bottle<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.389> you're<00:03:53.750> gonna<00:03:53.870> place<00:03:54.139> the

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
glass bottle and you're gonna place the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.500 
glass bottle and you're gonna place the
green<00:03:54.769> inside<00:03:55.669> which<00:03:55.939> is<00:03:56.090> going<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.359> be<00:03:56.449> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
green inside which is going to be the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.750 
green inside which is going to be the
grass<00:03:56.689> and<00:03:56.959> roll<00:03:57.859> it<00:03:58.010> into<00:03:58.129> a<00:03:58.250> cylinder<00:03:58.459> and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
grass and roll it into a cylinder and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.300 
grass and roll it into a cylinder and
then<00:03:59.079> you're<00:04:00.079> gonna<00:04:00.169> take<00:04:00.409> some<00:04:00.439> tweezers<00:04:00.859> or

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
then you're gonna take some tweezers or

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.330 
then you're gonna take some tweezers or
something<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.509> press<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:02.959> down<00:04:03.340> until

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
something and just press it down until

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.819 
something and just press it down until
it<00:04:04.639> comes<00:04:04.879> flat<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.479> I<00:04:05.780> decide<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.169> use<00:04:06.530> like

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
it comes flat and I decide to use like

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.520 
it comes flat and I decide to use like
the<00:04:07.400> end<00:04:07.579> of<00:04:07.759> my<00:04:07.939> x-acto<00:04:08.389> knife<00:04:08.720> because<00:04:09.349> it's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
the end of my x-acto knife because it's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.280 
the end of my x-acto knife because it's
round<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.699> flatten<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.150> down<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.569> then

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
round so I just flatten it down and then

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.249 
round so I just flatten it down and then
once<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.560> flatten<00:04:12.859> down<00:04:12.979> the<00:04:13.250> grass<00:04:14.259> we're

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
once you flatten down the grass we're

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.159 
once you flatten down the grass we're
going<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.769> take<00:04:15.919> the<00:04:16.250> tweezers<00:04:16.659> and<00:04:17.659> we're

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
going to take the tweezers and we're

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.170 
going to take the tweezers and we're
going<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.380> pick<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.949> UM<00:04:19.190> rosebush<00:04:19.789> and

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
place it inside

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.500

make sure you press it down and I do not

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.540 
make sure you press it down and I do not
bake<00:04:25.810> my<00:04:26.080> clay<00:04:26.440> if<00:04:26.740> I'm<00:04:27.040> putting<00:04:27.400> them<00:04:27.490> in

of the glass and as you can see just put

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.930 
of the glass and as you can see just put
three<00:05:25.780> little<00:05:26.020> things<00:05:26.410> on<00:05:26.770> there<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.520> I

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
three little things on there and I

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.400 
three little things on there and I
didn't<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.360> take<00:05:28.510> my<00:05:28.630> time<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.260> looks

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
didn't really take my time and it looks

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.410 
didn't really take my time and it looks
terrible<00:05:29.590> but<00:05:29.860> it's<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.520> tutorial<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:31.150> I'm<00:05:31.300> not

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
terrible but it's a tutorial and I'm not

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.910 
terrible but it's a tutorial and I'm not
really<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.950> perfectionist<00:05:32.950> so<00:05:33.240> um<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.710> then<00:05:35.830> you

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
really a perfectionist so um so then you

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.480 
really a perfectionist so um so then you
can<00:05:36.070> put<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.250> top<00:05:36.430> on<00:05:36.640> and<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:39.070> can<00:05:39.220> glue<00:05:39.460> on

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
can put the top on and you can glue on
