many you put in you don't have to put
any<00:01:53.229> but<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:53.650> just<00:01:53.890> think<00:01:53.950> it's<00:01:54.160> really<00:01:54.250> fun<00:01:54.840> let

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
any but I just think it's really fun let

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.340 
any but I just think it's really fun let
me<00:01:55.960> get<00:01:56.140> those<00:01:56.290> blended

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.679 

it's<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.010> what<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> should<00:02:03.119> look<00:02:03.150> like<00:02:03.330> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it's about what it should look like you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.570 
it's about what it should look like you
know<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.430> too

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
know I think it's good to not put too

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.029 
know I think it's good to not put too
many<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.060> still<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.960> taste<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
many in so you still get the taste of

it's<00:02:21.270> great<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.720> consistent<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.470> don't

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's great for consistent so you don't

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.100 
it's great for consistent so you don't
have<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.069> have<00:02:23.100> one<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.520> these<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> can

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
have to have one of these now you can

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
have to have one of these now you can
also<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.819> take<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> by<00:02:27.209> hand<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.660> don't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
also just take it by hand if you don't

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.350 
also just take it by hand if you don't
have<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.200> scoopers<00:02:28.590> stick<00:02:29.209> grab<00:02:30.209> it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
have one of the scoopers stick grab it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.430 
have one of the scoopers stick grab it
roll<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.020> up<00:02:31.910> try<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:33.420> round<00:02:34.110> as

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
roll it up try to get it as round as

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.059 
roll it up try to get it as round as
possible<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.780> little<00:02:36.989> easier<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.350> dip<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
possible it's a little easier to dip and

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.890 
possible it's a little easier to dip and
they<00:02:38.489> look<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:38.850> better<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.600> these<00:02:39.720> are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
they look a little better now these are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.229 
they look a little better now these are
really<00:02:40.230> sticky<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.040> hard<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.459> work<00:02:41.670> with<00:02:41.880> so

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
really sticky and hard to work with so

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.270 
really sticky and hard to work with so
you<00:02:42.300> wouldn't<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:42.989> able<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.380> dip<00:02:43.680> these<00:02:44.040> in

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you wouldn't be able to dip these in

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.309 
you wouldn't be able to dip these in
