00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello how about friends of all the staff 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.890
 welcome to this your channel and in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.049
 this time we are going to do the revised 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.030
 of a game that went viral lately 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.030
 the flap and bert we started 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.390
 very well what this game is about 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 is simply what a bird is that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.939
 they're like 8-bit graphics but 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.550
 because the gameplay is good is a game 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.620
 pretty simple but at the beginning it 's a 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.410
 little stressful because of the gameplay and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.290
 it is becoming addictive as it goes 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.570
 completing or advancing in the game is 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.379
 simply of subtracting to be able to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 raise or leave so that our 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.960
 friend the goal is to go through how many 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.440
 tubes we can in this case I have passed 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 for one 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.080
 the combination of the sounds when 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.870
 we pass when we die can reach 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.820
 be a bit stressful and that is because 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 something you have to deal every 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.440
 Once you play flap and see 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.070
 surpass your record and that of your friends is 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.780
 your goal more than anything is that simple 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.230
 you just have to go forward not 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.350
 there is another thing, there are no trophies, there is nothing 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.330
 just measure your score when you start 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.760
 and it's a little complicated the truth is very 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.940
 difficult to advance from two but already with the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 time because you are improving and you go 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.330
 making higher scores because right now 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.330
 my score greater than 59 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.340
 and it's a bit difficult to record and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.920
 concentrate then well I will try 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.980
 of playing concentrating and I'm going to accelerate 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.980
 so that they do not get so annoying 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.130
 good 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.630
 this game to be a bit complicated is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.700
 something stressful 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 let's try it one more time and I think 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.760
 what is implied in what is 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.760
 try this game 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.270
 and forget here was what is the review 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.850
 of the berg flaps game 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.740
