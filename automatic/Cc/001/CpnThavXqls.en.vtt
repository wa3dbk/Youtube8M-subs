one<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> thought<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> absolute<00:00:24.269> base

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
one what I thought was the absolute base

one what I thought was the absolute base
liest<00:00:25.500> gun<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.730> gay<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.900> will

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
liest gun in the gay but I think it will

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630 
liest gun in the gay but I think it will
probably<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.740> enough<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
probably get enough because it is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
probably get enough because it is
extremely<00:00:30.300> strong<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.009> man<00:00:32.279> o

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
extremely strong and that is the man o

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.370 
extremely strong and that is the man o

weapon<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.059> thinking<00:00:39.360> uh<00:00:39.510> must<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.960> pretty

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
weapon I was thinking uh must be pretty

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
weapon I was thinking uh must be pretty
good<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.309> day<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> was

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
good and on the first day when I was

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
good and on the first day when I was
using<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.540> oh<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.050> okay<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
using it I was like oh it's okay but it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
using it I was like oh it's okay but it
shoots<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.219> little<00:00:44.489> slow<00:00:44.730> i<00:00:44.760> guess<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
shoots a little slow i guess that's the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.029 
shoots a little slow i guess that's the
main<00:00:45.510> complaint<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.739> does

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
shoot a little bit slow but if you play

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
shoot a little bit slow but if you play
with<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.399> defensive<00:00:51.180> assault<00:00:51.660> rifle<00:00:51.960> play

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
with a more defensive assault rifle play

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
with a more defensive assault rifle play
style<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.620> when<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:52.770> say<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.160> i<00:00:53.489> basically

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
style and when i say that i basically

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
style and when i say that i basically
mean<00:00:54.360> pre<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> me<00:00:55.079> everything<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> shame

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

mean pre a me everything it's a shame
that<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.940> such<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> strong<00:00:57.539> tactic<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> does

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that is such a strong tactic and it does

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
that is such a strong tactic and it does
mean<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> SMGs<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.850> very<00:01:00.300> hard<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> use

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
mean that the SMGs are very hard to use

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
mean that the SMGs are very hard to use
if<00:01:01.230> people<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.620> doing<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
if people are doing this but you need to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.600 
if people are doing this but you need to
Priam<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> anticipate<00:01:04.260> people<00:01:05.070> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
Priam you need to anticipate people you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.580 
Priam you need to anticipate people you
need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> positioning<00:01:06.540> yourself<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:07.229> well

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
need to be positioning yourself as well

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
need to be positioning yourself as well
as<00:01:07.740> possible<00:01:08.280> basically<00:01:08.820> AKA<00:01:09.240> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.930> hector

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
as possible basically AKA kind of hector

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
as possible basically AKA kind of hector
lynching<00:01:10.470> sometimes<00:01:10.920> sometimes<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> using<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
lynching sometimes sometimes and using a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.679 
lynching sometimes sometimes and using a
cover<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.799> advantage<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.450> can

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
cover to your advantage but if you can

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
cover to your advantage but if you can
do<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.369> stick

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
do that and then on this thing you stick

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
do that and then on this thing you stick
on<00:01:17.790> high<00:01:18.090> caliber<00:01:18.630> i<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.650> grip

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
on high caliber i like to put on grip

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
on high caliber i like to put on grip
and<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> red<00:01:20.640> dot<00:01:20.850> sight<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.720> as

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and a red dot sight here you can see as

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
and a red dot sight here you can see as
well<00:01:22.049> i<00:01:22.110> thought<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.439> find<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> grip<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
well i thought i find that the grip just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
well i thought i find that the grip just
makes<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.420> easier<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:24.960> other

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
makes it a little bit easier when other

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
makes it a little bit easier when other
people<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.619> head<00:01:26.070> glitching<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.850> got

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
people are head glitching and just got

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
people are head glitching and just got
the<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> their<00:01:28.080> head<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.560> top<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the little bit of their head the top of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
the little bit of their head the top of
their<00:01:28.950> head<00:01:29.100> showing<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.939> actually

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
their head showing that i can actually

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
their head showing that i can actually
just<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.810> full<00:01:31.140> auto<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.890> while<00:01:32.189> i'm

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just go full auto on them while i'm

just go full auto on them while i'm
using<00:01:32.729> grip<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.479> still<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:34.110> them

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
using grip and i can still get them

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
using grip and i can still get them
without<00:01:35.280> groups<00:01:35.610> sometimes<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.180> gun<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
without groups sometimes the gun just

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
without groups sometimes the gun just
bounces<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.380> too<00:01:37.590> high<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.040> those<00:01:38.310> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bounces that bit too high but those your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
bounces that bit too high but those your

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
rods playing a lot of csgo poverty over
the<00:01:44.700> last<00:01:44.909> six<00:01:45.180> months<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.350> used

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the last six months or so I was so used

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.840 
the last six months or so I was so used
to<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.890> head<00:01:47.100> shots<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to going for head shots a lot at the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.389 
to going for head shots a lot at the
time<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> aim<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> head<00:01:49.049> anyway<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
time I do aim for the head anyway so I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
time I do aim for the head anyway so I
found<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.509> edged<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.869> with

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
found that if you do get edged up with

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
found that if you do get edged up with
this<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> turns<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.130> shot<00:01:53.399> kill

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this it turns it into a two shot kill

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.630 
this it turns it into a two shot kill
absolutely<00:01:54.710> deadly<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.280> find<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
absolutely deadly and I find that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
absolutely deadly and I find that
sometimes<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.240> slow<00:01:57.509> shooting<00:01:58.020> assault

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
sometimes the slow shooting assault

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530 
sometimes the slow shooting assault
rifles<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.130> bit<00:01:59.219> easier<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.939> use<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> mean

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
rifles a little bit easier to use I mean

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
rifles a little bit easier to use I mean
you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.750> waste<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.350> many<00:02:01.530> shots<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you don't waste so many shots and you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.280 
you don't waste so many shots and you
kind<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.450> forgiving<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> my

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
kind of it's a bit more forgiving in my

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.020 
kind of it's a bit more forgiving in my
opinion<00:02:04.619> say<00:02:04.979> you're<00:02:05.130> off<00:02:05.340> target<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
opinion say you're off target with a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.999 
opinion say you're off target with a
couple<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> bullets<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.530> still<00:02:07.799> hit

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.440 
couple of the bullets you can still hit
them<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.399> rest<00:02:08.700> without<00:02:08.879> wasting<00:02:09.209> too

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
them with the rest without wasting too

relatively quickly now an interesting

relatively quickly now an interesting
thing<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.290> was<00:02:35.380> kind<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.650> going<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.070> a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
thing is I was kind of going for a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.880 
thing is I was kind of going for a
nuclear<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.760> game<00:02:36.940> play<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.390> got<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
nuclear in this game play I got so so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.560 
nuclear in this game play I got so so
close<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.550> getting<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> nuclear<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.270> think<00:02:40.480> I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
close to getting the nuclear I think I

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.110 
close to getting the nuclear I think I
went<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.080> 20<00:02:41.830> streak<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.880> one

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
went on like a 20 streak on this one

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.910 
went on like a 20 streak on this one
which<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.480> kind<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.810> crazy<00:02:44.020> but<00:02:44.410> then<00:02:44.590> we<00:02:44.770> were

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
which is kind of crazy but then we were

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.250 
which is kind of crazy but then we were
playing<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.850> full<00:02:46.090> team<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> lot<00:02:46.870> easy<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
playing in a full team is a lot easy and

playing in a full team is a lot easy and
a<00:02:47.290> full<00:02:47.440> team<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.830> didn't<00:02:48.160> really<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.610> near<00:02:48.970> a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
a full team I didn't really get near a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.510 
a full team I didn't really get near a
like<00:02:49.450> 20<00:02:49.690> or<00:02:50.080> 30<00:02:50.350> kill<00:02:50.650> streak<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> was

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
like 20 or 30 kill streak when I was

playing on solo my own I just found it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.870 
playing on solo my own I just found it

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920

sometimes<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:46.970> not<00:04:47.030> like<00:04:47.210> every<00:04:47.570> single

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930

sometimes it's not like every single
time<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.680> use<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:49.070> you're<00:04:49.130> gonna<00:04:49.250> pop

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
time that you use it you're gonna pop

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
back up and get the person and they know

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.170 
back up and get the person and they know
what's<00:04:51.950> going<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.190> happen<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.670> big<00:04:52.820> puff<00:04:53.030> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
what's going to happen a big puff of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.910 
what's going to happen a big puff of
smoke<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.720> there<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.140> they<00:04:54.260> wait<00:04:54.470> there<00:04:54.740> and

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
smoke is there so they wait there and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
smoke is there so they wait there and
then<00:04:55.010> they<00:04:55.130> kill<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.420> don't<00:04:56.600> think<00:04:56.810> it's
