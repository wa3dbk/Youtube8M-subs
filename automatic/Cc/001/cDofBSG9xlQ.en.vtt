as a power button on the side of the
volume<00:01:45.220> buttons<00:01:45.690> are<00:01:46.690> tiny<00:01:47.789> there's<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.850> bit<00:01:49.000> of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
volume buttons are tiny there's a bit of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.900 
volume buttons are tiny there's a bit of
plastic<00:01:49.270> there<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.800> hopefully<00:01:51.789> see

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
plastic there as you can hopefully see

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.889 
plastic there as you can hopefully see
if<00:01:54.910> we<00:01:55.090> get<00:01:55.270> some<00:01:55.810> focus<00:01:56.259> here<00:01:59.520> as<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:01.720> can<00:02:01.750> see

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
if we get some focus here as you can see

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.130 
if we get some focus here as you can see
that<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:05.080> covering<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.740> button<00:02:06.039> plastic<00:02:07.140> so

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that it's covering the button plastic so

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.650 
that it's covering the button plastic so
that's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.729> not<00:02:10.000> good<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.330> all<00:02:10.479> and

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
that's really not good at all and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.590 
that's really not good at all and
they're<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:11.620> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.920> hole<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.730> buttons

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
they're right in the hole the buttons

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.850 
they're right in the hole the buttons
are<00:02:13.750> riding<00:02:14.080> very<00:02:14.650> hard<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> push<00:02:15.660> same<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
are riding very hard to push same as the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.699 
are riding very hard to push same as the
vibrate<00:02:18.310> switch<00:02:18.459> there's<00:02:19.060> barely<00:02:19.360> any<00:02:19.709> extra

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
vibrate switch there's barely any extra

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.410 
vibrate switch there's barely any extra
cut<00:02:20.890> out<00:02:21.070> for<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.590> bottom<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.040> all<00:02:24.280> ok<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
cut out for so the bottom is all ok I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.410 
cut out for so the bottom is all ok I
suppose<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.590> exposed<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.640> can<00:02:27.970> dock<00:02:28.239> it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
suppose it's exposed so you can dock it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.410 
suppose it's exposed so you can dock it
and<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:30.190> microphone<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.200> speaker<00:02:33.420> exposed

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and your microphone and speaker exposed

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
and your microphone and speaker exposed
enough<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:36.100> back<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:38.290> does<00:02:38.530> overlap<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
enough the back it does overlap this the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.449 
enough the back it does overlap this the
iphone<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> fair<00:02:40.450> bit<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.920> back<00:02:42.070> end<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
iphone a fair bit on the back end on the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.240 
iphone a fair bit on the back end on the
front<00:02:42.790> which<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.519> original<00:02:45.519> bumper<00:02:46.180> doesn't

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
front which the original bumper doesn't

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.039 
front which the original bumper doesn't
so<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:48.820> one<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.510> don't<00:02:49.660> work<00:02:49.840> ever

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
so that's one thing I don't work ever

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.890 
so that's one thing I don't work ever
and<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:54.100> floppy<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.640> is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and as you can see have floppy that is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.930 
and as you can see have floppy that is
it's<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.200> barely<00:02:56.799> doing<00:02:57.040> anything<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.640> reckon

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's just barely doing anything I reckon

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150 
it's just barely doing anything I reckon
if<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.209> drop<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.630> phone<00:02:58.959> on<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.799> concrete

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
if you drop this phone on the concrete

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.430 
if you drop this phone on the concrete
