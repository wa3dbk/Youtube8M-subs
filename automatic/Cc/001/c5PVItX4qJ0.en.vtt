00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
go BAM you're doing the spin you wanna

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
go BAM you're doing the spin you wanna
you<00:00:43.829> wanna<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.850> your<00:00:44.879> weight<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:50.550> practice

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you wanna put your weight to practice

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
you wanna put your weight to practice
keeping<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> point<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
keeping on that point just kind of just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.920 
keeping on that point just kind of just
sit<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:56.120> got<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> yeah

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sit there on that point got that yeah

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
sit there on that point got that yeah
I'm<00:00:58.079> counterclockwise<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> roll<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.370> my

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I'm counterclockwise so I roll on my

won-moon milk he tucks boom notice that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.800 
won-moon milk he tucks boom notice that
he<00:01:10.590> gets<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.549> speed<00:01:11.939> from<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
he gets a little bit of speed from a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 
he gets a little bit of speed from a
back<00:01:12.960> spin<00:01:13.170> almost<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.280> about

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
back spin almost right like you're about

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
back spin almost right like you're about
to<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.700> into<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.119> spin<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.020> BAM<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to go into a back spin but then BAM you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.390 
to go into a back spin but then BAM you
switch<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.520> us<00:01:17.909> decide<00:01:19.130> go<00:01:20.130> again

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
switch it off into us decide go again

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.719 
switch it off into us decide go again
he's<00:01:20.549> gonna<00:01:20.670> show<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> doing<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> windmill

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
he's gonna show you doing a windmill

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.429 
he's gonna show you doing a windmill
momentum<00:01:23.729> aside<00:01:24.530> stop<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:26.220> stops<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:27.240> there

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
momentum aside stop he stops right there

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
momentum aside stop he stops right there
you<00:01:28.439> notice<00:01:28.890> after<00:01:29.700> he's<00:01:29.850> finished<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you notice after he's finished with that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.700 
you notice after he's finished with that
little<00:01:30.600> size<00:01:30.840> man<00:01:31.049> he's<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> his<00:01:31.530> back

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
little size man he's going to his back

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.710 
little size man he's going to his back
spin<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.490> running<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> momentum<00:01:33.390> his

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
spin he's running out of momentum his

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.890 
spin he's running out of momentum his
spin<00:01:34.380> starting<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> slow<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.630> way<00:01:36.780> he

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
spin starting to slow down so the way he

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.120 
spin starting to slow down so the way he
gets<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.320> momentum<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.729> leg<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.890> whip

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
gets more momentum is this leg the whip

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
gets more momentum is this leg the whip
so<00:01:41.700> Nick's<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.060> show<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> combo<00:01:42.930> one

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so Nick's gonna show you the combo one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
so Nick's gonna show you the combo one
more<00:01:43.259> time<00:01:43.470> watch<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.460> he<00:01:44.579> loses<00:01:44.700> momentum

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
more time watch when he loses momentum

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.990 
more time watch when he loses momentum
he<00:01:45.780> kicks<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> left<00:01:46.560> leg<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.640> lead<00:01:47.820> into

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
he kicks that left leg up to lead into

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.130 
he kicks that left leg up to lead into
the<00:01:48.240> belly<00:01:48.869> swipe<00:01:49.909> BAM<00:01:50.990> losing<00:01:51.990> momentum

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the belly swipe BAM losing momentum

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.300 
the belly swipe BAM losing momentum
losing<00:01:52.770> momentum

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
losing momentum

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.730 
losing momentum
BAM<00:01:54.170> he's<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.350> use<00:01:55.590> his<00:01:55.829> left<00:01:56.310> leg<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.270> kick

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
BAM he's gonna use his left leg to kick

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.200 
BAM he's gonna use his left leg to kick
to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.860> his<00:01:58.979> momentum<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.520> push<00:01:59.759> his<00:01:59.969> whole

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to get his momentum to push his whole

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.560 
to get his momentum to push his whole
body<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.950> he's<00:02:01.950> gonna<00:02:02.250> use<00:02:02.460> his<00:02:02.640> other<00:02:03.329> leg

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
body back he's gonna use his other leg

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.959 
body back he's gonna use his other leg
to<00:02:03.719> boom<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.070> what's<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to boom just like that and what's that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
to boom just like that and what's that
last<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.799> boom

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
last one boom

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.270 
last one boom
so<00:02:08.520> almost<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> 1<00:02:09.300> 2<00:02:09.569> 3<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so almost like a 1 2 3 now let's do it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.150 
so almost like a 1 2 3 now let's do it
kind<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> quick<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.180> looks<00:02:12.360> like
