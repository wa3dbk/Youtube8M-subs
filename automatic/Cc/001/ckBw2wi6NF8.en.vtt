00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.939
 and how are you all welcome to a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.090
 new tutorial then in this video the 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.130
 weekend we will learn to validate 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.520
 text boxes to accept only 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.280
 numbers and only letters because everything is going 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.390
 to perform in Caesar then we go to 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.390
 give him a new project 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.199
 and it will be a windows force application 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.199
 by name validations 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.940
 and we are going to accept it so that it 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.460
 believe us 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.300
 well what we need would be two boxes 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.969
 of texts one for the numbers and others 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 for the letters then let's go to 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.920
 each toolbox and we're going to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.190
 look for the text books then we go to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.190
 add 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.500
 and now we are looking for a lay bowl and what 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.900
 we add 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.600
 and here we are going to need two 'label 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.379
 then here we have them and of equal 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 form two xbox 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.509
 so now this bold law we are going to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.219
 give right click properties and in your 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.810
 text property let's write to you 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.810
 example here letters 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.860
 to these numbers 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.080
 and here in this house I hate fashion 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.100
 right click 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.920
 and in the name property 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.920
 we are going to write txt lyrics 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.780
 and to the other txt numbers 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.880
 ok then now what are we going to do 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.770
 is to go to the solutions explorer and 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.130
 in our project we are going to click 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 right to add and we will add a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 class which will contain the methods 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.100
 to validate letters and numbers 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 then we are going to call this class 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.440
 validate 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.260
 and we are going to create it 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.960
 and here enters the key we are going to type the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.030
 code to which I already have created it and 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.950
 I'm just going to copy it 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.840
 and you can not worry because 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.390
 I will leave the project on my blog 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.250
 so they can download it then 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.680
 are two methods one that serves to 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.540
 validate the numbers here is the method 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.020
 it's called just numbers and others just 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.770
 letters and here marks us an error because 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:45.319
 we must import the library using 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:48.620
 system point windows dot forms for 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.470
 be able to use them 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.310
 events 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.980
 then now here in the box 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.260
 text let's give it right click and we're going 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 to work with the key press event or 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.810
 when selected, press a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.810
 key 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 each key press element we will give 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.680
 Double click 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.239
 and here we are going to call the class that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.099
 call validate here is point and like this 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.380
 this x of letters then we want that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.140
 only letters to car we pass only letters 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.440
 we visit the one that is equivalent to 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.280
 event there are 3 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.250
 and we close parentheses and semicolons and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.810
 that would be everything and likewise here in 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.950
 number we are going to give right click to 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.410
 properties and we're going to select the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.950
 event there are three since of equal 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.160
 way validate point here would be only 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.290
 numbers and we always spent the e that 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 It would be like I already told you the key event 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.720
 press then now let's debug 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.240
 and here for example if we want 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.920
 typing numbers is blocked because 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.240
 is working with elements when it 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.830
 press the key then it is not 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.080
 necessary to show a message but 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 it's just being blocked but if 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.970
 we visit lyrics all the same here if 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.830
 I try to type letters you can not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.840
 here I am pressing and he does not accept me 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.200
 none but when we need numbers 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.520
 all right then 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.440
 in this way you can do it 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.940
 can add another text box for 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.370
 example here 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.840
 we are going to give you the properties and we are 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.450
 to believe that for example always also 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.340
 are the numbers and just call a class 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.340
 validate points or numbers 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.270
 it's here 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.180
 and we're going to debug it so they can see that 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.180
 it works 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.750
 so for example to this also you 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.310
 I try to type letters and they can not 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.169
 then it 's so easy 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.810
 using the programming oriented to 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.930
 objects 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.000
 save us code and be able to reuse 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.220
 all this code and not just typing in 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.870
 each event because unlike no 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.280
 create the class we should be 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.800
 typing here where we call the method 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.470
 only numbers we would have to type everything 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.050
 this code all this code we would have 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.620
 to edit there then I hope that they 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.440
 serve the tutorial and subscribe to my 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300
 channel if they are not subscribed 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.610
 leave your comments with 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.030
 suggestions and with things that can 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.310
 improve so I hope it helps them 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.580
 the tutorial and see you in a next 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.580
 video of next weekend if it is 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.090
 what a happy weekend for all and 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.090
 goodbye
