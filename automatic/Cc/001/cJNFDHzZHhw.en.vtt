00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.980
 remove stain from our clothes 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.210
 children as you know they have many times 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.480
 small children playing with 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.150
 the soil or it is stained with chocolate or 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.180
 with food and sometimes it is very difficult 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.010
 get them out like we're going to do what 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.970
 we are going to need is a brush 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.970
 baking soda 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.240
 and what nothing 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 but oxidize peroxide water 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.760
 a dishwashing soap that what 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.929
 let's do 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.929
 Lets put 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in the clothes 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 in this way 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.150
 they can combine everything in a boat but 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.750
 I personally like to do it 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:21.430
 directly on the clothes we are going to put 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's spread some bicarbonate 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 about clothes 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.390
 where are the spots 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.270
 and as you can see it is a shirt of my 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:44.659
 girl and the pink then 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.119
 it would be very difficult to remove the spots 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.009
 many times the little ones grab and 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.610
 they are eating and cleaning their hands 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.760
 with clothes 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.580
 and being clear is very difficult to remove 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.400
 stains 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.060
 and we are going to put 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.060
 soap 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.830
 to you kitchen 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.710
 and we proceed 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.450
 to brush 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.390
 and finally we take it to the wash 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.390
 regular we leave about 5 minutes to 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.560
 Soak this up to make action on 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.530
 blocking we just put that is the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.170
 hydrogen and bicarbonate with soap 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.260
 about five minutes and then they pay what 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.569
 we can wash regularly I hope that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.569
 serve them and carry it out
