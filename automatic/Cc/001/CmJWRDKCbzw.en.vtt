HELLO PEOPLE FROM THE NEW GENERATION!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.900
This time, we will show you how to remove the front panel from a stereo in a Sentra

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.160
you do need to be very careful specifically with this piece that we´re going to remove

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.140
please don´t do it with the screwdriver

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.100
as you can see, this panel doesn´t have any scratch

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.560
and it should end like this after we worked on it

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.660
so, let´s start working from the top pushing the piece with a plastic paddle

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.040
let´s pull it from this part and upwards

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:48.180
let´s insert the paddle litle by little until it pops out...and ready

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.600
once it is out, we have in here two philips screws; let´s unscrew them

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.660
after we unscrew them , we´ll remove the panel were we have the speed lever

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.680
and it should come out as a complete piece

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.420
let´s do the same, let´s insert the paddle in the edge

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.720
and pop it out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.960
after we´ve removed this piece, now we´ll need a screwdriver

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.520
we will push it from the bottom and towards you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.200
we will have now removed the air conditioner panel; unplug the harness

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.180
after we´ve removed that piece, we´ll find some other two screws; philips screws as well

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.080
after you unscrew them; pull the front panel from the stereo towards

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.700
it has no staples so let´s just unplug the stereo

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.620
and in this way we will have removed the front panel

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.500
in case you want to remove the stereo

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.940
it´s going to have a metal piece here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.880
we need to remove all of the screws we can see from both sides

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.480
to be able to remove it

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.380
but for now we have removed the front panel

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.600
Well, that´s it. I hope we´ve helped you

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.580
and you know that if you have any doubt or question you may leave it in the comments below

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.360

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.120
change the spotlights on your boards

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.600
to be honest, I´ve not had the time to do it and show you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.140
but I´ll try to do it later and help you
