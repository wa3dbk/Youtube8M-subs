angles of the roof and you understand

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.339 
angles of the roof and you understand
why<00:00:07.529> it's<00:00:07.710> also<00:00:07.859> known<00:00:08.189> as<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.370> doghouse

why it's also known as a doghouse
dormer<00:00:10.349> from<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> inside<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.460> see<00:00:11.519> how

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
dormer from the inside you can see how

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.339 
dormer from the inside you can see how
it's<00:00:12.000> been<00:00:12.179> framed<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.570> receive<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> window

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it's been framed to receive a window

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169 
it's been framed to receive a window
right<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> opening<00:00:14.400> that's<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.940> header

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
right in this opening that's the header

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.849 
right in this opening that's the header
and<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> jacks<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> sides<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and here are the jacks on the sides and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.710 
and here are the jacks on the sides and
then<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.460> look<00:00:17.580> at<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.850> roof<00:00:18.090> line<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
then if you look at the roof line it's a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.490 
then if you look at the roof line it's a
912<00:00:19.410> pitch<00:00:19.770> which<00:00:20.310> means<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.029> every<00:00:21.500> 12

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
912 pitch which means that for every 12

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810 
912 pitch which means that for every 12
inches<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> we're<00:00:23.220> traveling<00:00:23.670> horizontally

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
inches that we're traveling horizontally

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
inches that we're traveling horizontally
from<00:00:24.449> Willie<00:00:24.689> outside<00:00:25.140> towards<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> center

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
from Willie outside towards the center

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.029 
from Willie outside towards the center
we're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.300> nine<00:00:27.720> inches<00:00:28.230> that's<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
we're going up nine inches that's the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.660 
we're going up nine inches that's the
easy<00:00:29.220> part

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
easy part

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
easy part
the<00:00:30.029> hard<00:00:30.300> part<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.689> figuring<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the hard part is figuring out how to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
the hard part is figuring out how to
roof<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.360> parts

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
roof all of this because on the parts

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
roof all of this because on the parts
it's<00:00:33.809> not<00:00:33.989> dormer<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.100> roof

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it's not dormer do you see how the roof

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's not dormer do you see how the roof
rafters<00:00:35.850> simply<00:00:36.239> travel<00:00:36.719> from<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
rafters simply travel from the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
rafters simply travel from the
doubled-up<00:00:37.860> plate<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> sidewall<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.120> to

doubled-up plate at the sidewall up to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
doubled-up plate at the sidewall up to
the<00:00:39.450> ridge<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.020> high<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.340> empty<00:00:41.579> space

toenail it right in yeah notice how the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.550 
toenail it right in yeah notice how the
whole<00:02:07.640> frame<00:02:07.939> shakes<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.630> little<00:02:08.840> bit<00:02:08.989> that's

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
whole frame shakes a little bit that's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.350 
whole frame shakes a little bit that's
what<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.799> flag<00:02:10.039> will<00:02:10.399> take<00:02:10.610> care<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.880> once<00:02:11.180> we

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
what the flag will take care of once we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:23.930 
what the flag will take care of once we
have<00:02:11.510> all<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> sheeting<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.230> place

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.440 

okay<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.860> last<00:02:26.070> rafter<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
okay this is the last rafter there it is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.230 
okay this is the last rafter there it is
butting<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:27.960> against<00:02:28.320> our<00:02:28.470> Ridge<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.940> of

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
butting up against our Ridge and of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.360 
butting up against our Ridge and of
course<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.660> other<00:02:30.780> end<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> resting<00:02:32.190> on

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
course the other end of it resting on

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.040 
course the other end of it resting on
the<00:02:32.910> new<00:02:33.060> header<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.510> we've<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.020> in

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the new header that we've just put in

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:45.380 
the new header that we've just put in
place<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:35.270> toenail<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:43.880> okay<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> next<00:02:45.270> step

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
place and toenail it okay the next step

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
place and toenail it okay the next step
involves<00:02:45.960> building<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.830> side<00:02:47.100> walls<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
involves building the side walls of the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.940 
involves building the side walls of the
dormer<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.510> call<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> cheek<00:02:49.050> walls<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
dormer which we call the cheek walls and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.860 
dormer which we call the cheek walls and
Riley<00:02:50.670> why<00:02:50.850> are<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.030> starting<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.480> this

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
Riley why are you starting with this

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.650 
Riley why are you starting with this
piece<00:02:52.140> with<00:02:52.350> bottom<00:02:52.800> plate<00:02:52.980> well<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.390> is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
piece with bottom plate well this is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.750 
piece with bottom plate well this is
going<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.440> give<00:02:55.530> us<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> nice<00:02:55.920> clean<00:02:56.160> look<00:02:56.310> will

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
going to give us a nice clean look will

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
going to give us a nice clean look will
we<00:02:56.880> go<00:02:57.300> into<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> header<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.140> could<00:02:58.320> put<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
we go into the header we could put the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.260 
we go into the header we could put the
top<00:02:58.800> plate<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.460> us<00:02:59.580> but<00:02:59.820> we'd<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.150> looking

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
top plate in for us but we'd be looking

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.530 
top plate in for us but we'd be looking
at<00:03:00.540> these<00:03:01.110> buttons<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.510> s<00:03:03.510> this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
at these buttons and this is a s this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.390 
at these buttons and this is a s this
looks<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.660> lot<00:03:06.810> neater<00:03:07.050> yeah<00:03:07.530> even<00:03:08.160> though<00:03:08.250> it's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
looks a lot neater yeah even though it's

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.960 
looks a lot neater yeah even though it's
a<00:03:08.460> rough<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.060> want<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.450> look<00:03:18.710> good

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
a rough way if you want it to look good

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.760 
a rough way if you want it to look good
now<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.540> pieces<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.200> are<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.470> actual

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
now the pieces that are the actual

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.800 
now the pieces that are the actual
vertical<00:03:23.370> studs<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:23.910> all<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.360> involve<00:03:24.660> an

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
vertical studs here all to involve an

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.930 
vertical studs here all to involve an
angle<00:03:25.110> how<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.440> get<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.790> well<00:03:26.790> I'm<00:03:26.880> just

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
angle how do you get that well I'm just

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930 
angle how do you get that well I'm just
gonna<00:03:27.090> take<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> scrap<00:03:27.750> bob<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.430> put<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.550> where

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
gonna take a scrap bob and put it where

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.150 
gonna take a scrap bob and put it where
its<00:03:30.090> laid<00:03:30.330> out<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.380> use<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> framing

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
its laid out and I use the framing

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.590 
its laid out and I use the framing
square<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:33.510> transfer<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:35.370> angle<00:03:35.910> onto<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
square to transfer this angle onto the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.280 
square to transfer this angle onto the
stud<00:03:36.900> all<00:03:37.260> right

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
stud all right

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.780 
stud all right
and<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.440> what<00:03:40.650> now<00:03:40.860> I'll<00:03:41.060> take<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:43.790> we

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
and now what now I'll take it and we

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.270 
and now what now I'll take it and we
know<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.120> by<00:03:45.540> looking<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.470> roughly

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
know that by looking at it it's roughly

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.100 
know that by looking at it it's roughly
around<00:03:47.460> 30<00:03:47.850> degrees<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.600> I'm<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.930> gonna

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
around 30 degrees so I'm just gonna

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.160 
around 30 degrees so I'm just gonna
about<00:03:49.800> an<00:03:49.920> inch<00:03:50.100> off<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.000> mock<00:03:51.240> kind<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
about an inch off of that mock kind of

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.199 
about an inch off of that mock kind of
it<00:03:52.290> 30<00:03:52.590> degrees<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:53.610> use<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.820> speed

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it 30 degrees you could use a speed

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.630 
it 30 degrees you could use a speed
square<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:55.440> could<00:03:55.620> use<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.920> speed<00:03:56.130> square<00:03:56.459> but

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
square we could use the speed square but

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.430 
square we could use the speed square but
a<00:03:56.670> lot<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.820> people<00:03:57.000> don't<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.390> them<00:03:57.750> which<00:03:58.260> I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
a lot of people don't have them which I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.880 
a lot of people don't have them which I
don't<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.800> my<00:03:58.830> pocket<00:03:59.280> right<00:03:59.430> now

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.120 

and<00:04:06.400> I'd<00:04:06.910> say<00:04:07.240> that's<00:04:07.450> gonna<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.320> 32<00:04:08.800> degrees

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
and I'd say that's gonna be 32 degrees

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:25.879 
and I'd say that's gonna be 32 degrees
we'll<00:04:09.310> do<00:04:09.460> it

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:42.510 

hey<00:04:26.889> actually<00:04:27.130> looks<00:04:27.520> like<00:04:27.639> 33

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.790 

and<00:04:42.940> now<00:04:43.150> we'll<00:04:43.300> cut<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.720> okay<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.530> four<00:04:44.740> or

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
and now we'll cut the okay the four or

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.440 
and now we'll cut the okay the four or
five<00:04:44.950> arias<00:04:45.340> like<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.640> know<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:46.060> four<00:04:46.330> all

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
five arias like I know I have four all

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.840 
five arias like I know I have four all
right<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:46.840> I'll<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.080> cut<00:04:47.260> them<00:04:47.410> off<00:04:47.850> okay

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
right so I'll just cut them off okay

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.430 
right so I'll just cut them off okay
with<00:04:49.000> all<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.240> plywood<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.870> place<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.320> the

with all the plywood in place on the
main<00:04:50.620> roof<00:04:51.010> we're<00:04:51.310> ready<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.730> put<00:04:52.300> up<00:04:52.330> our

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
main roof we're ready to put up our

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.270 
main roof we're ready to put up our
little<00:04:52.780> Ridge<00:04:53.310> for<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.700> dormer<00:04:55.690> itself<00:04:56.280> there

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
little Ridge for the dormer itself there

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.210 
little Ridge for the dormer itself there
you<00:04:57.400> go

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
you go

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.190 
you go

where this valley is gonna be we're
gonna<00:06:12.860> do<00:06:13.129> that<00:06:13.279> by<00:06:13.519> getting<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.629> plane<00:06:14.959> of

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
gonna do that by getting the plane of

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.040 
gonna do that by getting the plane of
these<00:06:15.589> rafters<00:06:16.129> locked<00:06:16.999> onto<00:06:17.329> the<00:06:17.509> plywood

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
and we'll snap a line from the ridge

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:25.689 
and we'll snap a line from the ridge
down<00:06:20.119> to<00:06:20.989> there<00:06:24.099> okay<00:06:25.099> now<00:06:25.129> this<00:06:25.369> is<00:06:25.429> our

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
down to there okay now this is our

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:26.169 
down to there okay now this is our
Valley

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:26.179 
Valley

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:29.709 
Valley
now<00:06:26.749> we'll<00:06:26.929> carry<00:06:27.229> out<00:06:27.379> layouts<00:06:27.969> at<00:06:28.969> 16<00:06:29.509> inches

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
now we'll carry out layouts at 16 inches

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:32.229 
now we'll carry out layouts at 16 inches
on<00:06:29.959> center<00:06:30.019> and<00:06:30.649> cut<00:06:31.129> our<00:06:31.279> jack<00:06:31.579> rafters<00:06:31.999> and

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:32.239 
on center and cut our jack rafters and

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.209 
on center and cut our jack rafters and
we'll<00:06:32.389> cut<00:06:32.569> we'll<00:06:32.809> measure<00:06:33.019> down<00:06:33.259> and<00:06:33.589> cut<00:06:34.099> our

jack rafters all right now this is

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.049 
jack rafters all right now this is
probably<00:06:38.989> the<00:06:39.169> most<00:06:39.259> complicated<00:06:39.849> stick<00:06:40.849> in

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:41.059 
probably the most complicated stick in

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.179 
probably the most complicated stick in
the<00:06:41.149> whole<00:06:41.329> little<00:06:41.869> dormer<00:06:42.289> frame<00:06:42.559> how<00:06:43.039> did

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
the whole little dormer frame how did

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.159 
the whole little dormer frame how did
you<00:06:43.309> get<00:06:43.459> this<00:06:43.639> angle<00:06:43.939> up<00:06:44.089> here<00:06:44.119> well<00:06:44.779> the<00:06:44.959> top

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
you get this angle up here well the top

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.619 
you get this angle up here well the top
is<00:06:45.439> our<00:06:45.649> 9<00:06:46.189> 12<00:06:46.519> pitch<00:06:46.819> which<00:06:47.149> is<00:06:47.300> our<00:06:47.449> roof

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
is our 9 12 pitch which is our roof

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.439 
is our 9 12 pitch which is our roof
pitch<00:06:47.869> vertically<00:06:48.529> right<00:06:48.889> and<00:06:49.429> down<00:06:50.149> here<00:06:50.360> at

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
pitch vertically right and down here at

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.119 
pitch vertically right and down here at
the<00:06:50.539> valley<00:06:50.749> we've<00:06:51.229> cut<00:06:51.529> the<00:06:51.649> 912

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
the valley we've cut the 912

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.879 
the valley we've cut the 912
horizontally<00:06:53.119> exactly<00:06:53.929> and<00:06:54.110> then<00:06:54.259> we've<00:06:54.679> cut

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
horizontally exactly and then we've cut

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.189 
horizontally exactly and then we've cut
it<00:06:55.009> into<00:06:55.129> the<00:06:55.339> roof<00:06:55.519> at<00:06:55.759> a<00:06:55.819> 33<00:06:56.449> degree<00:06:56.479> angle

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
it into the roof at a 33 degree angle

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.049 
it into the roof at a 33 degree angle
and<00:06:57.349> that<00:06:57.829> relates<00:06:58.129> to<00:06:58.399> the<00:06:58.610> cheek<00:06:58.819> wall

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059 
and that relates to the cheek wall

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:01.899 
and that relates to the cheek wall
that's<00:06:59.329> right<00:06:59.539> great<00:07:00.469> so<00:07:00.739> it's<00:07:01.129> all<00:07:01.279> set<00:07:01.459> to<00:07:01.610> go

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
that's right great so it's all set to go

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.419 
that's right great so it's all set to go
I'll<00:07:01.969> set<00:07:02.209> just<00:07:02.569> right<00:07:03.409> in<00:07:03.589> am<00:07:03.769> I<00:07:03.949> on<00:07:03.979> there

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:04.429 
I'll set just right in am I on there

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.700 

okay<00:07:19.550> and<00:07:19.730> this<00:07:19.790> one<00:07:20.000> is<00:07:20.150> same<00:07:20.750> exact<00:07:21.200> angle

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
okay and this one is same exact angle

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.660 
okay and this one is same exact angle
now<00:07:22.310> a<00:07:22.370> just<00:07:22.820> a<00:07:23.000> shorter<00:07:23.480> distance
