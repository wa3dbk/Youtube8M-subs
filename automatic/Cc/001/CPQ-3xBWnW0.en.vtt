is different the record button is

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.460 
is different the record button is
different<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:09.740> it's<00:05:09.890> pretty<00:05:10.220> neat<00:05:11.080> its<00:05:12.080> splash

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
so now I'm going to take the case off so

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.770 
so now I'm going to take the case off so
when<00:05:31.700> you're<00:05:31.850> opening<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.240> up<00:05:32.360> just<00:05:32.660> be

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
when you're opening it up just be

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.660 
when you're opening it up just be
careful<00:05:33.230> make<00:05:33.410> sure<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> hold<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.890> camera<00:05:34.400> so

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
careful make sure you hold the camera so

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.340 
careful make sure you hold the camera so
that<00:05:34.820> way<00:05:34.970> you<00:05:35.030> don't<00:05:35.120> drop<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:35.870> when<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.050> open

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
that way you don't drop it when you open

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.250 
that way you don't drop it when you open
it<00:05:36.380> up<00:05:36.590> I'm<00:05:37.310> not<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> fan<00:05:38.030> of<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.600> way<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:38.810> any

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
it up I'm not a fan of the way so any

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.620 
it up I'm not a fan of the way so any
packages<00:05:39.890> this<00:05:40.100> with<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.670> the<00:05:40.940> screws<00:05:41.360> on

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
packages this with the on the screws on

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.410 
packages this with the on the screws on
the<00:05:41.720> bottom<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:42.290> have<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:42.530> take<00:05:42.710> off<00:05:42.920> I<00:05:43.420> like

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
the bottom and I have to take off I like

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.730 
the bottom and I have to take off I like
the<00:05:44.600> way<00:05:44.750> go<00:05:44.990> for<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.230> does<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.410> little<00:05:45.650> bit

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
the way go for it does a little bit

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.460 
the way go for it does a little bit
better<00:05:46.450> but<00:05:47.450> that<00:05:47.810> has<00:05:47.930> nothing<00:05:48.110> to<00:05:48.260> do<00:05:48.440> with

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
better but that has nothing to do with

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.310 
better but that has nothing to do with
the<00:05:48.830> performance<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.490> camera<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.660> here's

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
the performance of the camera so here's

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.490 
the performance of the camera so here's
the<00:05:51.530> case<00:05:52.570> definitely<00:05:53.570> a<00:05:53.750> lot<00:05:53.960> different<00:05:54.380> than

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
the case definitely a lot different than

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.900 
the case definitely a lot different than
the<00:05:54.620> other<00:05:54.770> cases<00:05:55.660> as<00:05:56.660> you<00:05:56.780> can<00:05:56.900> see<00:05:57.140> I<00:05:57.910> really

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
the other cases as you can see I really

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.370 
the other cases as you can see I really
like<00:05:59.450> this<00:06:00.040> so<00:06:01.040> far<00:06:01.340> so<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.390> does<00:06:02.630> come<00:06:02.900> off<00:06:02.930> in

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
like this so far so it does come off in

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.540 
like this so far so it does come off in
the<00:06:03.740> same<00:06:03.950> fashion<00:06:04.280> as<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:05.300> other<00:06:06.550> sunni

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
the same fashion as the other sunni

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.760 
the same fashion as the other sunni
camera<00:06:08.180> as<00:06:08.240> well<00:06:08.450> it's<00:06:08.990> a<00:06:09.110> little<00:06:09.590> bit

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
camera as well it's a little bit

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.330 
camera as well it's a little bit
different<00:06:09.980> when<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:10.400> pop<00:06:10.640> it<00:06:10.670> off<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:12.340> little

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
different when you pop it off a little

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.160 
different when you pop it off a little
bit<00:06:13.460> more<00:06:13.700> sturdy<00:06:13.970> I<00:06:14.180> think<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.650> like<00:06:16.100> that

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
bit more sturdy I think so I like that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.990 
bit more sturdy I think so I like that
the<00:06:18.170> button<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:18.800> on<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:18.980> top<00:06:19.070> down<00:06:19.670> instead<00:06:19.940> of

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
the button is on the top down instead of

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.100 
the button is on the top down instead of
in<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.270> back<00:06:20.540> which<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:20.930> like<00:06:21.080> as<00:06:21.230> well

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
in the back which I like as well

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.159 
in the back which I like as well
so<00:06:22.740> far<00:06:23.069> I'm<00:06:23.280> real<00:06:23.520> happy<00:06:23.699> with<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.960> look

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
so far I'm real happy with the the look

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.460
