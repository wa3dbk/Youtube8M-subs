00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
on and slowly integrate them onto the

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.050 
on and slowly integrate them onto the

thoughts because these pellets with all

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.650 
thoughts because these pellets with all

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
these treat bits and seats really aren't

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.050
