00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.739
 unlike the other two Casio did not show in this is 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.429
 small program are now presenting their authenticity for free that means they 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.429
 can download without having to pay for it from the App Store 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.380
 Lime is nothing but a kind of calculator 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.390
 For the ORF last year a lot of different calculation violated 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 the various percent calculation helpers are clearly arranged 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950
 Subjects arranged 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 So I can because they get in the field of anesthesia, for example 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.160
 then things like the body measurement index or body surface look us 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.080
 Just let it work on how 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 the body mass index weight easily on the touch screen 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.110
 larger one 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.670
 and the weight 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.650
 and then get my BMI calculated immediately 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.350
 I can also call more via the info point as well as these values 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.420
 and what clinical benefit they are and how they are 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.020
 Of course you might have liked to arrange this here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.860
 sea 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 the program is equal share but BMI pathological or not and me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.810
 Armani must first work on the info but Armani has to work the whole thing but that means 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.290
 this is 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.020
 the same is 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.190
 Kapoor area calculation also here I can by input 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.730
 Haina size 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.570
 and my weight 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 Danny Ecker promise that this is the way to go 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.500
 different calculation formula so Bolt on Hey Kock and Moss counter 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 Neher body surface to let ads 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.240
 yes percent the whole applies not only to computers but of course synonymous 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.860
 For 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.010
 Things that go a little bit into the bavaria area of ​​clinical medicine 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.510
 little 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.780
 Schoo values 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.090
 the chance is the subject area gastrointestinal 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.900
 For example, if Cisco services assessment history of its acute 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.210
 pancreatitis 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.900
 Use Barenberg 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.250
 I'll just dig in the appropriate clinical parameters and say okay 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.199
 The age of the patient is like Stada Coke's game when they're around 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.989
 what are the liver enzymes? 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.379
 and pitchers there then 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.790
 by corresponding indication of clinical parameters 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.109
 we the 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.620
 theoretical mortality of patients he calculates using Tesco Systems 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.439
 but that's not all. "We also have three percent left 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.269
 some 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.039
 very nice features in here that are very little practical 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.209
 for example 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.649
 for the KEC Peskow 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.559
 At Merck the corps must be safe in the Corvette on one after 85 minutes 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.589
 measure and to make it easier for me 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:52.579
 the program has a stopwatch here so i can start back up too 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.879
 then 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.099
 The seconds counter starts to work then can majority based here 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.949
 the different from the criteria 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.319
 the Bibi media speak values 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.579
 then enter accordingly 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.729
 Although you can fast here 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.559
 and Beister Hanna h after a further five minutes score score 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.389
 May take off again 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.649
 can serve then also stop 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.619
 better judge in this case 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:24.679
 here also Gezer the info both of course further information 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.989
 to the mix others to SAP Guest big and what meaning 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.280
 Overall, a Precht is cold at the loud program that fell like Son 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.689
 Areas of expertise 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.689
 simply available as a very good little helper 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.679
 the program for free to so many cases recommendable to download 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.400
 then one has to be for one or the other forms 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.440
 Doctors surely use it once
