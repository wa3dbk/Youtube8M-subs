00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello good afternoon friends today I bring you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.630
 an iphone 5 boxing 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.940
 as you can see this is exclusive to 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.710
 movistar open it this already had 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.770
 open to put the micro 100 for not 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.779
 be struggling right now with the smoke and 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.900
 all this good look how can you see 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.390
 It is 4 inches diagonally 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.450
 this is the white one brings a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 camera 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.850
 front and a camera after the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.850
 8-megapixel rear 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.960
 the front is 1.3 that records 720 p the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.260
 Rear record in 1080p 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.120
 you can see it's a very parent design 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.309
 we acquire this in white 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 because apparently black 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.359
 he developed a lot from the back 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.039
 that's why there are covers and 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.190
 all that we're going to see that he has in the 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.190
 box 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.530
 If the manual polka dots of iphones 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.659
 Manzana 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.380
 the key by audio by the micro 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.689
 follow 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.750
 sorry for the musician since this team 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 has more without the manuals as they 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.930
 I say the stickers 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.550
 that more our 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.080
 are the hearing aids are the new ones 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.980
 hearing aids that he released 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.440
 ap 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.100
 we are father this design as the father 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.940
 very elegant let's see the charger 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.030
 wall and the usb cable with the new 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.610
 connector 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490
 small than normal 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 is the one that brings the team here the most 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.100
 that on the one hand 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.100
 i 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 that this side has the entrance to 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.730
 the nano without a fence will distinguish 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.730
 although there is a little bit better than 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.580
 up has the button depends on off 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.220
 this side to block sound but 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.930
 we have uploaded the volume down in the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.930
 bottom part has two speakers 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:16.010
 with 3.5 mm hector 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.830
 and the load connector 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.740
 surprise him see how it works 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.770
 and the proximity sensor in the part of 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.700
 up and you see the headset 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.700
 to see how it looks 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.319
 this one that has a processor 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.370
 m 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.819
 to 6 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.799
 which supposedly promises double in 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.510
 regarding productivity of what is the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.780
 Iphone 4 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.000
 sorry the 4s 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.000
 and apparently this supports lt 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.629
 for the 4g network 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.630
 you can see this 3g of the movistar because 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.480
 here in san luis potosí 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.870
 there is no 4g network unfortunately not for 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.330
 show them the equipment itself is now 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.340
 very father runs games a lot better 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.880
 the applications open much more 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.880
 Quick 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.549
 Well, I'm going to burn, I can show you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.770
 the photos do not have to configure what 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.310
 to lose 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.660
 without the camera 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.660
 how about the resolution 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.740
 as you can see be very father 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.939
 the quality is very, very, very good 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.840
 stability I also imagine that life 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.840
 It will also go very well 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.550
 and what else can I tell you about this 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.250
 team 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.920
 this team is one of the most delegates 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 has seven points six millimeters of 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.150
 thickness of thickness 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.640
 despite this 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.980
 112 grams which makes it very light 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.550
 feels the truth very, very, very light in 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.840
 the hand a very good team among all 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.430
 the things d 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.430
 as you know it among what is to go 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.340
 Once ready 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.800
 we'll see 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.050
 that love to víctor 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.479
 but you know if he grabs it 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.199
 that apparently if it takes a bit with 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.199
 the depression 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.060
 with víctor 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.560
 unfortunately here where I am is a 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.230
 building then here you battle a lot 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.210
 with the signal that is fixed does not hold well 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.210
 the signal only has a hairline 2 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.410
 the truth is that very father this put you 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.160
 back of the room say in what more 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.940
 We can use here to see for 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.139
 the settings 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.020
 let's see look 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.139
 training 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.409
 a total of 16 GB that the actual capacity 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.889
 is 13 gigabytes 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.869
 since as you know they are always discounted 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:57.159
 the operators for the things that they 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:59.160
 they put less then the capacity that is 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.440
 the real one they always say 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.440
 after version 6.1 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.650
 with the movistar 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.330
 and well, good friends, I hope you have 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.680
 liked this little guy in boxing 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.680
