00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
unit panel up there so i've got those

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.770 
unit panel up there so i've got those
three<00:00:40.440> panels<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:41.129> 128th<00:00:41.969> lots<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.510> peace

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
three panels their 128th lots of peace

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
three panels their 128th lots of peace
and<00:00:43.190> then<00:00:44.190> i've<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:45.649> 154<00:00:46.649> watt<00:00:46.950> panel

and then i've got one 154 watt panel

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.299 
and then i've got one 154 watt panel
that's<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:48.090> by<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> rear<00:00:49.320> air<00:00:49.559> conditioner

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that's going by the rear air conditioner

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
that's going by the rear air conditioner
so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.570> complete<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.710> up

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so that will complete that but it's up

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.610 
so that will complete that but it's up
and<00:00:53.070> running<00:00:53.239> here's<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> MPPT<00:00:55.379> charge

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and running here's the MPPT charge

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.729 
and running here's the MPPT charge
controller<00:00:57.379> right<00:00:58.379> here<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.559> it's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
controller right here and when it's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
controller right here and when it's
blinking<00:01:02.190> they're<00:01:02.399> showing<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> batteries

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
blinking they're showing the batteries

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.250 
blinking they're showing the batteries
are<00:01:03.600> fully<00:01:03.840> charged<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> here's<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
are fully charged and here's kind of a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.880 
are fully charged and here's kind of a
control<00:01:08.220> panel<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:09.320> it's<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> hard<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
control panel here it's kind of hard to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
control panel here it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.400> there's<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.180> light<00:01:12.540> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
see because there's so much light but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.969 
see because there's so much light but
that<00:01:13.049> shows<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> hundred

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that shows that there are a hundred

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.410 
that shows that there are a hundred
percent<00:01:14.280> charged<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> i'll<00:01:18.360> show

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
percent charged right now and i'll show

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
percent charged right now and i'll show
you<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:18.960> video<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> process<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
and you'll see those all hooked up in

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.220 
and you'll see those all hooked up in
the<00:02:10.929> battery<00:02:11.620> bay<00:02:11.890> i<00:02:12.300> had<00:02:13.300> some<00:02:13.540> custom<00:02:13.959> wiring

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the battery bay i had some custom wiring

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.790 
the battery bay i had some custom wiring
done<00:02:14.650> i<00:02:14.680> used<00:02:15.330> welding<00:02:16.330> wire<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> had<00:02:17.769> a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
done i used welding wire and had a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.949 
done i used welding wire and had a
batter<00:02:18.099> at<00:02:18.310> local<00:02:18.670> battery<00:02:18.970> shop<00:02:19.300> make<00:02:19.630> me<00:02:19.840> up

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
batter at local battery shop make me up

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.420 
batter at local battery shop make me up
all<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.349> cables<00:02:20.800> on<00:02:22.050> toaht<00:02:23.050> cables<00:02:23.739> with

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
all the cables on toaht cables with

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.370 
all the cables on toaht cables with
battery<00:02:25.239> wire<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.959> guess<00:02:29.019> that's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
battery wire and that's I guess that's

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.259 
battery wire and that's I guess that's
one<00:02:29.590> recommendation<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.489> can<00:02:30.730> give<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.120> to

one recommendation I can give you is to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.320 
one recommendation I can give you is to
to<00:02:32.230> use<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.769> best<00:02:33.100> quality<00:02:34.980> copper<00:02:35.980> wire<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
to use the best quality copper wire and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.039 
to use the best quality copper wire and
welding<00:02:37.330> wire<00:02:37.510> as<00:02:37.900> possible<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:40.780> just

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
welding wire as possible and that's just

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.780 
welding wire as possible and that's just
for<00:02:41.260> me<00:02:41.440> watching<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:42.130> these<00:02:42.280> YouTube<00:02:42.760> videos

just<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.100> was<00:02:51.370> running<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.620> or<00:02:53.620> no<00:02:53.769> I

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
just you know I was running to or no I

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.289 
just you know I was running to or no I
see<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> had<00:02:54.400> three<00:02:56.640> regular<00:02:57.640> 12-volt

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
see I had three regular 12-volt

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.250 
see I had three regular 12-volt
batteries<00:02:58.810> before<00:02:59.019> and<00:03:00.870> they<00:03:01.870> would<00:03:02.049> never

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
batteries before and they would never

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.860 
batteries before and they would never
let<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.340> would<00:03:03.670> never<00:03:03.970> last<00:03:04.239> anything

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
let it would never last anything

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.050 
let it would never last anything
compared<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.590> I've<00:03:05.739> got<00:03:05.769> going<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.400> so

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
compared to what I've got going now so
