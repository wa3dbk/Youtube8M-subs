could<00:04:30.740> really<00:04:30.920> find<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.420> bit

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
could really find is that it is a bit

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.720 
could really find is that it is a bit
flimsy<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:34.040> shouldn't<00:04:34.460> worry<00:04:34.550> about

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
flimsy but you shouldn't worry about

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.060 
flimsy but you shouldn't worry about
that<00:04:34.910> because<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:36.290> really<00:04:36.590> not<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.770> toy

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
that because it it's really not a toy
