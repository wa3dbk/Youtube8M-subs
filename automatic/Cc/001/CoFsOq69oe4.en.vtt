realistically now this may seem like a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.000 
realistically now this may seem like a
small<00:01:30.330> perhaps<00:01:30.600> even<00:01:30.960> inconsequential<00:01:31.350> thing

small perhaps even inconsequential thing

but<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.150> the

but if you think about the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

perspective<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.250> means<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:36.120> more

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
perspective it means you have much more

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.900

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
structure is more realistic then you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
structure is more realistic then you
might<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.800> twice<00:01:41.190> before<00:01:41.400> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
might just think twice before you

with<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.360> where<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:51.870> shoot<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.170> lights<00:01:52.320> out

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
with it where you shoot the lights out

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
with it where you shoot the lights out
and<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.770> usually<00:01:53.220> break<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:53.580> set<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.630> all

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and they usually break as a set but all

now what persistent damage has been

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
now what persistent damage has been
confirmed<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.719> extent<00:03:04.079> at<00:03:04.200> which<00:03:04.379> it's

but<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.439> still<00:03:19.680> remains<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.159> be<00:03:20.189> seen<00:03:20.780> seeing

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
but that still remains to be seen seeing

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.119 
but that still remains to be seen seeing

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
as the game takes place in a setting

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.500 
as the game takes place in a setting
where<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> United<00:03:23.819> States<00:03:24.000> has<00:03:24.150> been<00:03:24.209> put<00:03:24.419> to

its<00:03:24.629> knees<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.290> does<00:03:25.560> seem<00:03:25.769> plausible<00:03:26.010> that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
its knees it does seem plausible that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.190 
its knees it does seem plausible that
the<00:03:26.519> damage<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:26.970> remain<00:03:27.239> throughout<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.079> as

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the damage will remain throughout but as

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.990 
the damage will remain throughout but as
I<00:03:28.290> said<00:03:28.439> that<00:03:28.799> does<00:03:29.010> still<00:03:29.219> remain<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.609> seen

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
I said that does still remain to be seen

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.190 
I said that does still remain to be seen
