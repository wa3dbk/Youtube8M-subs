 marathoner 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.939
 a few weeks before the beginning of the days of Beijing following the departure of the marathon 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.539
 protein win the Swiss go to Chinese cities for 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.169
 take your bearings 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.390
 this last world championship it was like that because the japon they say that 

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.740
 Mon 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.250
 medals all these games he says 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 we say right away that his first impressions of evidence 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860
 to achieve the novella carrots false start of the race I will be 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.539
 certainly 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.679
 man u like a horse in his box and starting just waiting for one thing 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.699
 that the door opens perfectly contrary I will be very nervous but 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.909
 also very focused on this race which for Thursday's race 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 but you know when one hears raising one's elbow and starting it's a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.090
 everything is freedom and fishing I will finally be able to do what I 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.089
 prefer to run 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230
 everything was granted not to listen but it is important to be 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.010
 very well physically before taking the start because with the stress and 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.770
 the sometimes wacky excitement we feel a lot of two small pains a 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.810
 little bit everywhere we sell our body 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.170
 supposed to possess once the race is started for the issuance of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.270
 several mails 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 the ladies is the depressed 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.880
 if the first part of this wall by covers the city wanted rather 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.020
 affordable 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 it should not cause too much damage among all participants 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.220
 the oklahoma devon jobs in france by August 5 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.060
 for half of the course with them this first loop of 10 km 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.660
 and then very long straight lines 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.290
 so if at this waypoint m 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.640
 are not in a very good day is indeed not even the most 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.050
 to think of an Olympic medal 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.250
 because there is really no very complicated scratch on the course in 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.089
 this first part 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:16.939
 I just have to keep up the pace so far 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.939
 the hardest is yet to come 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.239
 it is a dream 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.209
 loaned by caen we are here at km 35 x where truly begins king 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.119
 assumes points in the majority of marathons 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.479
 it is absolutely necessary to stay in the leading group and even to a mutism will 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.969
 to make some efforts that it might not have been expected that he has 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:54.519
 conducted 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.629
 taye taiwo got ten years after 35 kilometers and despite all the 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.159
 drives that the referendum our body is already in the red and so 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.689
 from this kilometer 35 hp it's our brain that must take over 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.539
 it's from here that the tactics today the tables in his role 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.569
 and that's the most difficult element to master in a marathon me 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 I hope I'll do a smart race here in Beijing 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.219
 Either the arms fighter very well here we are right in front of the stadium 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.319
 Olympic so-called bird's nest 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.029
 and it is here that it will be necessary tomorrow perhaps on August 24th it is a knee 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.909
 returned to this stage will be really a very emotional moment 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.829
 maybe unless you're a bit of the first rain to beat him 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.099
 with others for for a medal 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.769
 I'm really looking forward to this moment by the military you 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.939
 can be the richest man on the planet but nothing will get you 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.429
 as much emotion as treading the track of the Olympic stadium which has under 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:01.159
 cheers thousands of supporters who will be present for the last 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.529
 day of the giro 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.529
 it's worth all the gold in the world 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.909
