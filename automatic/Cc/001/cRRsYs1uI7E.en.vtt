coming-of-age<00:00:29.419> reluctant<00:00:30.419> hero<00:00:30.630> types<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
coming-of-age reluctant hero types and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.020 
coming-of-age reluctant hero types and
and<00:00:32.490> how<00:00:32.820> Jordans<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:34.710> military<00:00:35.430> man<00:00:35.790> he's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and how Jordans like a military man he's

and how Jordans like a military man he's
got<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.240> jaw<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.840> he<00:00:37.489> thinks<00:00:38.489> super<00:00:39.210> super<00:00:39.329> fast

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
got a jaw and he thinks super super fast

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.980 
got a jaw and he thinks super super fast
and<00:00:40.820> that's<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:42.630> he<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.780> it's

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
and that's that's just how he is it's

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.420 
and that's that's just how he is it's
very<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.470> my<00:00:43.680> own<00:00:43.710> personality

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and it's very different from a lot of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.890 
and it's very different from a lot of
the<00:00:45.660> world's<00:00:45.900> I<00:00:45.960> play<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.850> add<00:00:48.480> to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.530 
everywhere and so you're really going to
get<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.160> see<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.340> lot<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.610> lot<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.180> things<00:01:58.300> it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
get to see a lot a lot of things it's

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.900 
get to see a lot a lot of things it's
not<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.170> focus<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.619> much<00:01:59.800> on<00:02:00.010> on<00:02:00.490> what

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
not going to focus so much on on what

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.020 
not going to focus so much on on what
happens<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.479> earth<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.369> really<00:02:03.880> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
happens here on earth and so really the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.790 
happens here on earth and so really the
I'd<00:02:04.660> say<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.930> sky<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> limit<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:05.650> it's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
I'd say the sky is the limit but it's

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.160 
I'd say the sky is the limit but it's
