all that stuff in there and whatever was
in<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.080> previous<00:02:27.260> backpack<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.970> this

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
in the previous backpack is in this

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.699 
in the previous backpack is in this
backpack<00:02:29.480> basically<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
backpack basically it's like a

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.710 
backpack basically it's like a
connection<00:02:31.220> through<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> telephone<00:02:32.150> and

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
connection through a telephone and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.920 
connection through a telephone and
you're<00:02:33.620> connected<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.310> other<00:02:34.459> part<00:02:35.030> so

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
you're connected to the other part so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.590 
you're connected to the other part so
that's<00:02:36.080> I'm<00:02:36.290> dying<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> nether<00:02:37.190> right

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
that's I'm dying in the nether right

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.710 
that's I'm dying in the nether right
let's<00:02:38.600> say<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.200> die<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.480> respawn<00:02:41.480> and

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
let's say on I die here I respawn and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.240 
let's say on I die here I respawn and
all<00:02:42.650> now<00:02:43.070> all<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.640> stuff<00:02:43.970> stayed<00:02:44.330> back<00:02:44.780> there

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
all now all my stuff stayed back there

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.300 
all now all my stuff stayed back there
so<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:47.200> means<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.620> die<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> nether

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
so that means if you die in the nether

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.370 
so that means if you die in the nether
you<00:02:49.550> lose<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.030> stuff<00:02:50.450> however<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:51.200> with

you lose all your stuff however not with
this<00:02:51.500> backpack<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.400> let's<00:02:52.640> go<00:02:52.820> run<00:02:53.060> over<00:02:53.090> to
