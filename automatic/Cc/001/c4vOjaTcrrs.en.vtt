00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
this is the second of a two-part

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.919 
this is the second of a two-part
tutorial<00:00:01.760> looking<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:02.850> drawing<00:00:03.149> isometric

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
tutorial looking at drawing isometric

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.280 
tutorial looking at drawing isometric
cylinders<00:00:11.179> so<00:00:12.179> because<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> draw<00:00:13.139> any

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
cylinders so because I have to draw any

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.640 
cylinders so because I have to draw any
lines<00:00:13.469> aren't<00:00:13.679> really<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.160> compass<00:00:15.650> place

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
lines aren't really get my compass place

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.269 
lines aren't really get my compass place
on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.600> bottom<00:00:18.600> corner<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:18.990> box<00:00:19.230> here

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:36.680 

check<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> out<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:27.650> side<00:00:30.380> mitches<00:00:35.420> top<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
check it out to side mitches top of it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:54.190 
check it out to side mitches top of it
nicely<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:41.790> top<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.270> their<00:00:42.390> box

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.480 

so<00:00:55.200> you<00:00:55.290> can<00:00:55.380> see<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.650> my<00:00:55.770> inside<00:00:56.130> circle

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
so you can see that my inside circle

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.020 
so you can see that my inside circle
starting<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.910> take<00:00:57.060> form<00:00:58.400> now<00:00:59.400> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.880> going

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
starting to take form now this is going

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.600 
starting to take form now this is going
to<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> start<00:01:00.720> reliance<00:01:01.290> game<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:02.489> my

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
to have to start reliance game find my

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.820 
to have to start reliance game find my
center<00:01:02.910> point<00:01:03.060> where<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.500> smaller<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> those

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
center point where the smaller of those

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.860 
center point where the smaller of those
arcs<00:01:05.250> remember<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.030> draw<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> line<00:01:06.390> from<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
arcs remember we draw a line from the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.740 
arcs remember we draw a line from the
top<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> box<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> bottom<00:01:08.580> corner<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.330 

from<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> bottom<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> box<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> top

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
from the bottom of the box to the top

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.719 
from the bottom of the box to the top
corner<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.729> where<00:01:23.729> those<00:01:23.850> lines<00:01:24.090> across<00:01:24.390> our

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
corner and where those lines across our

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
corner and where those lines across our
longest<00:01:26.729> bagging<00:01:27.479> line<00:01:27.660> that's<00:01:28.470> where<00:01:28.649> our

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
longest bagging line that's where our

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.460 
longest bagging line that's where our
center<00:01:28.920> point<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.160> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.399> so<00:01:29.670> easier

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
center point is going to be so easier

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
center point is going to be so easier
and<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:40.220> let's<00:01:41.220> get<00:01:41.369> adjusting<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.850> compass

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and there let's get adjusting my compass

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
and there let's get adjusting my compass
and<00:01:42.330> chicken<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> heads<00:01:43.100> both<00:01:44.100> those

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and chicken to the heads both those

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.440 
and chicken to the heads both those
eight<00:01:44.520> points<00:01:44.910> which<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:47.450> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
eight points which it does I can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.520 
eight points which it does I can
describe<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> smaller<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.560> arcs<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
describe it the smaller the arcs and the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.820 
describe it the smaller the arcs and the
same<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.009> honor<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:54.530> chicken

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
same for this honor as one chicken

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.580 
same for this honor as one chicken
it<00:01:56.160> doesn't<00:01:56.430> quite<00:01:56.540> match<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.570> move<00:01:58.470> your

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it doesn't quite match up move your

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
it doesn't quite match up move your
point<00:01:58.799> around<00:01:58.979> slightly<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:06.690> know<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.320> we

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
point around slightly you know so now we

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.940 
point around slightly you know so now we
have<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> circle<00:02:08.310> inside<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.299> circle<00:02:09.860> set<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
have a circle inside a circle set to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.740 
have a circle inside a circle set to
medium<00:02:11.100> one<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> front<00:02:12.209> faces<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
medium one of the front faces of a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
medium one of the front faces of a
cylinder<00:02:13.049> and<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.739> rest<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.980> our<00:02:14.070> cylinder<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
cylinder and the rest of our cylinder is

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.259 
cylinder and the rest of our cylinder is
going<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.610> come<00:02:14.760> back<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.120> way<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.820> I

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
going to come back this way so I

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.220 
going to come back this way so I
mentioned<00:02:19.049> crates<00:02:19.470> before<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.100> crate<00:02:20.459> is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
mentioned crates before a crate is

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.780 
mentioned crates before a crate is
essentially<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> box<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:23.370> fits<00:02:23.549> exactly

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
essentially a box that fits exactly

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.229 
essentially a box that fits exactly
around<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:25.290> shape<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.560> you're<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.239> be

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
around the shape that you're going to be

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.630 
around the shape that you're going to be
drawing<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.900> creates<00:02:28.590> useful<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.280> having<00:02:29.489> us

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
drawing and creates useful for having us

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.030 
drawing and creates useful for having us
to<00:02:29.790> figure<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.120> whereabouts<00:02:30.600> things<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:31.650> on

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to figure out whereabouts things go on

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.259 
to figure out whereabouts things go on
the<00:02:32.549> page<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.870> our<00:02:34.260> solders<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.920> fit

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
the page and so our solders going to fit

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.910 
the page and so our solders going to fit
exactly<00:02:36.500> into<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:39.049> until<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.110> add<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.530> crate

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
exactly into the until I add a crate

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.370 
exactly into the until I add a crate
that's<00:02:41.040> made<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:42.170> larger<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.230> these<00:02:43.320> two

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that's made of the larger of these two

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
that's made of the larger of these two
squares<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:44.070> isometric<00:02:44.519> squeeze<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.910> are

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
squares these isometric squeeze that are

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.990 
squares these isometric squeeze that are
drawn<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.709> extended<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.610> far<00:02:47.820> as

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
drawn here and extended back as far as

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.569 
drawn here and extended back as far as
its<00:02:48.150> cylinders<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> go<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.489> going

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
its cylinders going to go so I'm going

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.039 
its cylinders going to go so I'm going
to<00:02:50.670> make<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> cylinder<00:02:52.340> 120<00:02:53.340> millimeters<00:02:53.730> on

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
to make the cylinder 120 millimeters on

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.720 
to make the cylinder 120 millimeters on
so<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.079> first<00:02:55.440> need<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.070> draw<00:02:56.310> some<00:02:56.519> lines

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
so I first need to do is draw some lines

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.699 
so I first need to do is draw some lines
it's<00:02:56.970> 80<00:02:57.120> degrees<00:02:57.209> back<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:58.410> each<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it's 80 degrees back for each of the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:14.730 
it's 80 degrees back for each of the
corners<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.139> squared

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.980 

and<00:03:15.740> I'm<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> measure<00:03:16.750> 120<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:17.900> each

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
and I'm going to measure 120 for each

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:36.090 
and I'm going to measure 120 for each
one<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.410> make<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.710> small<00:03:18.980> mark

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.910 

and<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:36.820> you've<00:03:36.970> done<00:03:37.120> separately<00:03:37.710> so<00:03:38.710> is<00:03:38.830> too

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
and if you've done separately so is too

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.010 
and if you've done separately so is too
much<00:03:39.100> should<00:03:39.400> be<00:03:39.520> exactly<00:03:39.760> vertical<00:03:40.300> and

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
much should be exactly vertical and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.630 
much should be exactly vertical and
those<00:03:41.170> too<00:03:41.440> much<00:03:41.620> should<00:03:41.860> be<00:03:41.950> at<00:03:42.100> 30<00:03:42.310> degrees

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
those too much should be at 30 degrees

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.330 
those too much should be at 30 degrees
from<00:03:42.730> each<00:03:42.880> other<00:03:43.860> let's<00:03:44.860> see<00:03:45.010> how<00:03:45.100> well<00:03:45.250> I've

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
from each other let's see how well I've

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:59.570 
from each other let's see how well I've
done<00:03:48.030> looks<00:03:49.030> pretty<00:03:49.420> good<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.720> me

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.150 

so<00:04:00.580> let's<00:04:00.760> create<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.270> I've<00:04:01.360> drawn<00:04:01.600> out<00:04:02.160> just

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
so let's create that I've drawn out just

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.330 
so let's create that I've drawn out just
shape<00:04:03.400> here<00:04:03.610> this<00:04:03.820> kind<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.780> box<00:04:05.350> that's<00:04:06.070> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
shape here this kind of box that's the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.980 
shape here this kind of box that's the
the<00:04:06.760> box<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.300> Sun<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.660> going<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.810> fit

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
the box that the Sun is going to fit

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.980 
the box that the Sun is going to fit
inside<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> I'm<00:04:09.850> just<00:04:09.940> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.120> need<00:04:10.240> to<00:04:10.300> draw

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
inside so I'm just going to need to draw

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.230 
inside so I'm just going to need to draw
a<00:04:11.320> circle<00:04:11.890> for<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.220> back<00:04:12.460> edge<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.180> the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
a circle for the back edge of the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.900 
a circle for the back edge of the
cylinder<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:15.190> way<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.460> do<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.730> is

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
cylinder and the way that I do that is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.870 
cylinder and the way that I do that is
by<00:04:16.380> turning<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.440> back<00:04:17.650> edge<00:04:17.860> into<00:04:18.610> an

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
by turning this back edge into an

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.080 
by turning this back edge into an
isometric<00:04:19.480> squared<00:04:20.550> so<00:04:21.550> I<00:04:21.580> can<00:04:21.730> do<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.940> just

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
isometric squared so I can do that just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.300 
isometric squared so I can do that just
using<00:04:22.390> my<00:04:23.520> 3066<00:04:24.520> screw<00:04:25.830> draw<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> line<00:04:26.980> 50

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
using my 3066 screw draw a line 50

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.170 
using my 3066 screw draw a line 50
degrees<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.640> way<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:30.400> draw<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.910> vertical

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
degrees that way and draw a vertical

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.840 
degrees that way and draw a vertical
line<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.860> swear<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.400> I've<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.670> created

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
line and swear that I've just created

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.450 
line and swear that I've just created
here<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:38.980> square<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
here it's going to be the square of the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.330 
here it's going to be the square of the
circle<00:04:39.820> sets<00:04:40.000> inside<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:42.010> I'll<00:04:42.100> go<00:04:42.190> through

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
circle sets inside so I'll go through

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.950 
circle sets inside so I'll go through
exactly<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.730> same<00:04:42.790> process<00:04:43.180> as<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.690> did<00:04:43.840> for

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
exactly the same process as I did for

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.990 
exactly the same process as I did for
the<00:04:44.020> front<00:04:44.140> circles<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:45.640> find<00:04:46.240> my<00:04:47.820> points<00:04:48.820> for

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
the front circles to find my points for

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:16.000 
the front circles to find my points for
my<00:04:49.150> arcs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.890 

right<00:05:17.010> now<00:05:17.280> because<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:18.660> gonna<00:05:18.810> be<00:05:18.870> a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
right now because this is gonna be a

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.510 
right now because this is gonna be a
solid<00:05:19.320> shade<00:05:19.530> it's<00:05:19.890> going<00:05:20.010> to<00:05:20.070> be<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.190> solid

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
solid shade it's going to be a solid

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.610 
solid shade it's going to be a solid
cylinder<00:05:20.930> you're<00:05:21.930> going<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.140> be<00:05:22.230> some<00:05:22.410> lines

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
cylinder you're going to be some lines

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.840 
cylinder you're going to be some lines
on<00:05:22.830> here<00:05:22.950> that<00:05:23.010> we're<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.340> going<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.640> see

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
on here that we're not going to see

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.030 
on here that we're not going to see
we're<00:05:24.540> not<00:05:24.630> going<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.840> see<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.200> underside<00:05:25.770> of

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
we're not going to see the underside of

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.010 
we're not going to see the underside of
the<00:05:26.370> curve<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.540> will<00:05:27.630> be<00:05:27.690> hidden<00:05:27.870> by

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
the curve because it will be hidden by

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.780 
the curve because it will be hidden by
the<00:05:28.080> riskier<00:05:28.410> object<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.400> we<00:05:29.490> don't<00:05:29.640> actually

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
the riskier object so we don't actually

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.220 
the riskier object so we don't actually
really<00:05:30.090> need<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.420> worry<00:05:30.600> about<00:05:30.720> drawing<00:05:31.020> that

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
really need to worry about drawing that

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.370 
really need to worry about drawing that
on<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.820> draw<00:05:33.000> this<00:05:33.180> top<00:05:33.450> top<00:05:34.110> side<00:05:34.320> of

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
on so I can draw this top top side of

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.440 
on so I can draw this top top side of
the<00:05:34.440> curve<00:05:34.620> here<00:05:34.910> but<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.000> needn't<00:05:36.240> worry

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
the curve here but it needn't worry

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.270 
the curve here but it needn't worry
about<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.690> underside<00:05:37.260> so<00:05:37.950> I'm<00:05:38.010> just<00:05:38.130> going<00:05:38.250> to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
about the underside so I'm just going to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:57.160 
about the underside so I'm just going to
draw<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.550> top<00:05:38.730> side<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:39.440> this<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.530> my<00:05:40.620> compass

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.370 

and<00:05:58.160> then<00:05:58.310> I'm<00:05:58.400> going<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.640> find<00:05:59.080> they<00:06:00.080> seem<00:06:00.290> to

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
and then I'm going to find they seem to

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:23.309 
and then I'm going to find they seem to
point<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.620> my<00:06:00.800> smaller<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.730> the<00:06:01.850> arcs

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.229 

and<00:06:24.429> I<00:06:25.429> can<00:06:25.579> draw<00:06:26.049> this<00:06:27.049> more<00:06:27.379> of<00:06:27.529> the<00:06:27.619> axe<00:06:27.769> and

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:28.239 
and I can draw this more of the axe and

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:44.750 
and I can draw this more of the axe and
it's<00:06:29.239> my<00:06:29.389> compass

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.620 

remember<00:06:45.760> I<00:06:45.820> don't<00:06:46.000> need<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.180> go<00:06:46.270> all<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.510> way

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
remember I don't need to go all the way

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.660 
remember I don't need to go all the way
around<00:06:46.810> because<00:06:47.410> some<00:06:47.920> of<00:06:47.950> these<00:06:48.070> lines<00:06:48.340> going

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
around because some of these lines going

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.360 
around because some of these lines going
to<00:06:48.760> be<00:06:48.820> headed<00:06:52.170> so<00:06:53.170> there's<00:06:53.380> the<00:06:53.860> back<00:06:54.040> curve

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
to be headed so there's the back curve

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.510 
to be headed so there's the back curve
for<00:06:54.910> my<00:06:55.120> sander<00:06:56.110> now<00:06:56.740> all<00:06:56.890> I<00:06:56.920> need<00:06:57.130> to<00:06:57.220> do<00:06:57.370> now

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
for my sander now all I need to do now

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.980 
for my sander now all I need to do now
has<00:06:57.820> drawn<00:06:58.030> the<00:06:58.150> back<00:06:58.270> piece<00:06:58.450> up<00:06:58.630> to<00:06:58.720> the<00:06:58.810> front

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
has drawn the back piece up to the front

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.780 
has drawn the back piece up to the front
piece<00:06:59.170> that's<00:07:00.100> probably<00:07:00.370> the<00:07:00.460> most<00:07:00.580> simple

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
piece that's probably the most simple

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.570 
piece that's probably the most simple
part<00:07:01.120> of<00:07:01.210> the<00:07:01.270> whole<00:07:01.390> process<00:07:02.220> all<00:07:03.220> we<00:07:03.400> need<00:07:03.550> to
