00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.439 
thing that I want to reiterate is that I
wasn't<00:03:42.780> pinching<00:03:43.680> my<00:03:43.829> skin<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.730> come<00:03:45.000> up<00:03:45.180> from

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
wasn't pinching my skin you come up from

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.839 
wasn't pinching my skin you come up from
the<00:03:45.569> sides<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.799> come<00:03:47.069> down<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.639> then<00:03:47.730> you

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
the sides and you come down and then you

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.759 
the sides and you come down and then you
roll<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.180> back<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.780> forth<00:03:49.199> so<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.650> go

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
roll it back and forth so you just go

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.800 
roll it back and forth so you just go
like<00:03:50.040> left<00:03:50.340> right<00:03:50.609> left<00:03:50.639> right<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.629> come

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like left right left right and you come

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.050 
like left right left right and you come
under<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.440> up<00:03:52.680> okay<00:03:53.099> that's<00:03:53.310> very<00:03:53.430> important

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
under and up okay that's very important

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.210 
under and up okay that's very important
because<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.720> come<00:03:55.019> too<00:03:55.260> close<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.099> and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
because if you come too close to it and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.250 
because if you come too close to it and
start<00:03:56.459> squeezing<00:03:56.849> it's<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.660> possibility<00:03:58.230> that

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
start squeezing it's a possibility that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.140 
start squeezing it's a possibility that
you're<00:03:58.440> gonna<00:03:58.530> push<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.980> content<00:03:59.459> back<00:03:59.790> down

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
you're gonna push the content back down

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.750 
you're gonna push the content back down
into<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.720> skin<00:04:00.959> as<00:04:01.169> opposed<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.010> out<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.730> the

into the skin as opposed to out of the
skin<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.389> right<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.780> very<00:04:03.959> important

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
skin all right it's a very important

the college pore it will turn back into

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.590 
the college pore it will turn back into
another<00:05:10.040> way<00:05:10.250> ahead<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:10.700> hopefully<00:05:11.150> with

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
another way ahead but hopefully with

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.510 
another way ahead but hopefully with
this<00:05:11.720> technique<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.320> coming<00:05:12.740> from<00:05:12.919> underneath

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
this technique of coming from underneath

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.260 
this technique of coming from underneath
and<00:05:13.940> going<00:05:14.270> out<00:05:14.419> you<00:05:15.350> will<00:05:16.000> see<00:05:17.000> better

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
and going out you will see better

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.290 
and going out you will see better
results<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.900> less<00:05:18.860> scarring<00:05:19.640> which<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.120> one

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
results and less scarring which is one

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.610
