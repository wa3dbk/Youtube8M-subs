00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.569
 small accessories application of Windows 7 show 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.240
 I know that I also works on Windows XP or Vista 

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.179
 prayer 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:24.609
 Amon though this is the little Zuger application short note and 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.609
 Although with the application you can have a little 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.730
 Tidy up Steffel that notes upkeep or take notes and yes 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.719
 I'll explain a little bit about that and Reich but the short note 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.780
 Percent you can find the application by placing on state 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.990
 on all programs and then on accessories 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.910
 and there you will find "short" here as well. MultiTerm gets it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.940
 it 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.950
 and then it opens on that one there 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.090
 to the plan a note 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.380
 rich enough with this where he could write something 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.230
 Here I just finish painting 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 l'oreal 3 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.220
 Heermann 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.040
 in front of them 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.960
 Gyllenhaal go 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.770
 so that's my mom for example now 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.409
 that when i tutorial 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.950
 on the canal Clemens Fritz above the 8 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.960
 how can you still go to the edge of the member third here and here the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.980
 Sticky note Heil zoom in or out or broaden or what 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.870
 always 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.900
 and yes then with two symbols around once for this one so this one 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.140
 Conclude and one of this acheson around this x is there for the note 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 Clear 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530
 and dense plus is there for it 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.390
 Although I can create a new note one can also control the end back 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840
 for a new note or hold control goes to clear 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.259
 I'm just here on new note and you see it opens 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.660
 a second note 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.950
 to submit projects to our title will not be automatic here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.169
 deleted there are directly in this black 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.609
 was deleted by years and just click on it will disappear 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.619
 and yes I find the application no light very cool 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.710
 since the service of that a Christian also the color is so good 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.109
 actually okay 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 as that glaring whiteness or whatever you say 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.599
 percent 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.779
 Years Internet finds or so for example is the keynote or as well 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.299
 always the tool is called 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.069
 because that is enough on the operating system installed I think so 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.519
 helpful and good 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.919
 around 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.800
 yes you can also make a right click on 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.830
 then you can cut out here copy insert delete or everything 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.949
 to mark 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:55.089
 Environmentalists to the terms here explain themselves and you see 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:59.979
 yes still few drive like blue green pink purple white and yellow 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.909
 If I just now believe in times you can see here that the note 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.849
 Blue is inherited 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.939
 and yes 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.379
 that's just yellow now because the notes are mostly yellow 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.320
 but we have to deal with more of what color underwater 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.499
 you want to have 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.659

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.829
