up<00:05:00.759> there<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:02.110> hit<00:05:02.409> a<00:05:02.440> button<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.889> certain

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
up there you hit a button a certain

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.529 
up there you hit a button a certain
amount<00:05:03.219> of<00:05:03.310> times<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.849> then<00:05:03.969> you<00:05:04.360> get

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
amount of times and then you get

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.779 
amount of times and then you get
strength<00:05:04.990> one<00:05:05.409> for<00:05:06.039> as<00:05:06.129> long<00:05:06.250> as<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.639> hold

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789

it and there's chest up there I think

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.600 
it and there's chest up there I think
this<00:05:09.039> is<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.219> custom<00:05:09.639> plugin<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:11.610> Willa
