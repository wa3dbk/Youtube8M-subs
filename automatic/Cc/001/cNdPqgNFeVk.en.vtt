in<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.870> video<00:00:07.200> we'll<00:00:07.710> talk<00:00:07.920> more<00:00:08.160> about

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
in this video we'll talk more about

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.700 
in this video we'll talk more about
updating<00:00:08.970> variables<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.780> loops<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.440> how<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
updating variables in loops and how we

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.830 
updating variables in loops and how we
can<00:00:11.010> use<00:00:11.190> loops<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.910> model<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> motion<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
can use loops to model the motion of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.920 
can use loops to model the motion of
objects<00:00:13.520> we've<00:00:14.520> gone<00:00:14.730> over<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:15.390> we<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.750> make

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
objects we've gone over how we can make

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.990 
objects we've gone over how we can make
a<00:00:15.960> simple<00:00:16.379> loop<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:17.010> changes<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> value<00:00:17.970> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
a simple loop that changes the value of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210 
a simple loop that changes the value of
a<00:00:18.300> variable<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.930> we've<00:00:19.829> mentioned<00:00:20.039> before

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a variable as we've mentioned before

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.819 
a variable as we've mentioned before
we're<00:00:21.089> not<00:00:21.269> limited<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.929> what<00:00:22.079> variables

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
we're not limited as to what variables

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.909 
we're not limited as to what variables
we<00:00:23.099> can<00:00:23.249> manipulate<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> loop<00:00:24.800> here<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
we can manipulate in the loop here is a

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.550 
we can manipulate in the loop here is a
program<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:27.029> creates<00:00:27.210> two<00:00:27.689> spheres<00:00:27.989> and<00:00:28.320> an

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
program that creates two spheres and an

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.249 
program that creates two spheres and an
arrow<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.789> also<00:00:29.970> uses<00:00:30.419> a<00:00:30.720> loop<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
arrow and that also uses a loop to

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.310 
arrow and that also uses a loop to
calculate<00:00:31.769> new<00:00:32.070> values<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> vector<00:00:33.329> R<00:00:33.600> by

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
calculate new values for a vector R by

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.260 
calculate new values for a vector R by
adding<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.860> constant<00:00:35.130> amount<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> X

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
adding a constant amount to the X

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.470 
adding a constant amount to the X
component<00:00:36.840> each<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.700> let's<00:00:38.700> add<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.150> print

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
component each time let's add a print

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
component each time let's add a print
statement<00:00:39.540> into<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.590> loop<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.610> sure

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
statement into the loop and to make sure

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.820 
statement into the loop and to make sure
that<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.510> vector<00:00:42.780> R<00:00:42.990> is<00:00:43.260> being<00:00:43.620> updated

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
that the vector R is being updated

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.890 
that the vector R is being updated
properly<00:00:46.040> run<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.160> program<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.900> everything

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
properly run the program and everything

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.520 
properly run the program and everything
looks<00:00:49.140> good<00:00:50.180> what<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.510> wanted<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.290> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
looks good what if we wanted to use this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
looks good what if we wanted to use this
vector<00:00:52.980> R<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.670> change<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> location<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
vector R to change the location of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.280 
vector R to change the location of the
second<00:00:55.500> sian<00:00:55.950> sphere<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:57.570> we'd<00:00:57.720> like<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> see

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
second sian sphere what we'd like to see

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.800 
second sian sphere what we'd like to see
is<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.530> science<00:00:59.430> fair<00:00:59.700> moving<00:01:00.300> across<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
is the science fair moving across the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.200 
is the science fair moving across the
screen<00:01:01.200> every<00:01:01.829> time<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.400> it<00:01:02.550> gets<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.970> new

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
screen every time that it gets a new

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
screen every time that it gets a new
position<00:01:03.769> what<00:01:04.769> should<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.070> add<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
position what should we add to the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.870 
position what should we add to the
program<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> where<00:01:06.509> should<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.930> add<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.880> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
program and where should we add it so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.720 
program and where should we add it so
let's<00:01:09.090> add<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.630> command<00:01:10.020> inside<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.800> loop<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
let's add a command inside the loop that

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.120 
let's add a command inside the loop that
creates<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.300> new<00:01:12.540> sphere<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.230> has<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.500> position

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
creates a new sphere that has a position

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.719 
creates a new sphere that has a position
vector<00:01:14.310> R

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.270 

will<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.659> change<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.409> location<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
will this change the location of the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.700 
will this change the location of the
cyan<00:01:23.640> sphere<00:01:24.060> making<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.289> it<00:01:25.439> moves

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
cyan sphere making it look like it moves

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
cyan sphere making it look like it moves
across<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> screen<00:01:26.659> let's<00:01:27.659> run<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> program

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
across the screen let's run the program

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
across the screen let's run the program
and<00:01:28.649> see<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> flash<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.429> activity

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and see so we see a flash of activity

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.929 
and see so we see a flash of activity
that<00:01:33.360> ends<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> line<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.500> cyan<00:01:35.159> spheres<00:01:35.610> if

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that ends with a line of cyan spheres if

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.529 
that ends with a line of cyan spheres if
we<00:01:36.869> add<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.259> rate<00:01:37.530> statement<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.670> loop<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
we add a rate statement into the loop it

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.510 
we add a rate statement into the loop it
will<00:01:39.600> slow<00:01:40.049> down<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.500> speed<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.069> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
will slow down the speed at which the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.840 
will slow down the speed at which the
computer<00:01:41.909> runs<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.450> loop<00:01:42.659> calculations

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
computer runs the loop calculations

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.999 
computer runs the loop calculations
writing<00:01:44.850> rate<00:01:45.119> 10<00:01:45.659> means<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> computer

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
writing rate 10 means that the computer

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
writing rate 10 means that the computer
will<00:01:47.369> only<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.939> ten<00:01:48.299> calculations<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.319> one

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
will only do ten calculations in one

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.029 
will only do ten calculations in one
second<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:51.630> looks<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> brand<00:01:52.560> new<00:01:52.649> sphere

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
second it looks like a brand new sphere

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.190 
second it looks like a brand new sphere
was<00:01:53.310> created<00:01:53.819> every<00:01:54.179> time<00:01:54.420> through<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> loop

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
was created every time through the loop

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.559 
was created every time through the loop
this<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:56.369> makes<00:01:56.610> sense<00:01:56.759> since<00:01:57.299> each

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
this actually makes sense since each

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.870 
this actually makes sense since each
time<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.080> go<00:01:58.349> through<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.860> loop<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.849> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
time I go through the loop there is a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.630 
time I go through the loop there is a
new<00:02:00.149> R<00:02:00.420> vector<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.110> each<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> sphere

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
new R vector and each of the sphere

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.789 
new R vector and each of the sphere
statements<00:02:03.240> basically<00:02:03.509> makes<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.200> new<00:02:04.470> sphere

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
statements basically makes a new sphere

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.589 
statements basically makes a new sphere
from<00:02:05.159> scratch<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.849> that<00:02:06.149> new<00:02:06.390> position

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
from scratch at that new position

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.699 
from scratch at that new position
without<00:02:07.079> deleting<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.099> previous<00:02:08.549> sphere<00:02:09.709> we

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
without deleting the previous sphere we

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.830 
without deleting the previous sphere we
wanted<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.280> display<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.420> single

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
wanted the display to have one single

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.530 
wanted the display to have one single
sphere<00:02:12.959> moving<00:02:13.560> across<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.890> screen<00:02:14.540> let's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
sphere moving across the screen let's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.569 
sphere moving across the screen let's
think<00:02:15.720> about<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.769> changing<00:02:17.370> for

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
think about what would be changing for

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.390 
think about what would be changing for
that<00:02:17.790> sphere<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:19.110> spheres<00:02:19.410> color<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.040> radius

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that sphere the spheres color and radius

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
that sphere the spheres color and radius
would<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.120> any<00:02:21.360> different<00:02:21.840> each<00:02:21.989> time

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
would not be any different each time

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.319 
would not be any different each time
through<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.799> loop<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.120> need<00:02:24.269> to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
through the loop so they don't need to

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.220 
through the loop so they don't need to
be<00:02:24.630> updated

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
be updated

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.099 
be updated
the<00:02:25.950> spheres<00:02:26.250> position<00:02:26.850> however<00:02:27.090> does<00:02:27.780> need

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
the spheres position however does need

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.990 
the spheres position however does need
to<00:02:28.139> change<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.799> that's<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.579> really<00:02:29.609> need

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
to change and that's all we really need

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.170 
to change and that's all we really need
to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.329> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.810> loop<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.430> let's<00:02:32.639> try<00:02:32.910> only

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
to do in the loop so let's try only

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.770 
to do in the loop so let's try only
updating<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.230> spheres<00:02:34.560> position<00:02:35.220> attribute

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
updating the spheres position attribute

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.840 
updating the spheres position attribute
since<00:02:36.780> we've<00:02:36.959> already<00:02:37.200> named<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:38.010> sphere<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
since we've already named the sphere we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.020 
since we've already named the sphere we
can<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.329> reassign<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.470> new<00:02:40.650> R<00:02:40.920> vector<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
can just reassign the new R vector to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.559 
can just reassign the new R vector to
the<00:02:42.150> position<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.630> ball<00:02:43.079> 2<00:02:43.319> by<00:02:43.829> typing<00:02:44.280> ball<00:02:45.239> to

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
the position of ball 2 by typing ball to

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.840 
the position of ball 2 by typing ball to

object<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.900> sphere<00:02:52.200> named<00:02:52.500> ball<00:02:52.889> 2<00:02:53.160> and

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
object the sphere named ball 2 and

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.379 
object the sphere named ball 2 and
changes<00:02:54.569> its<00:02:54.780> position<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> vector<00:02:56.040> R

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
changes its position to the vector R

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.940 
changes its position to the vector R
since<00:02:57.389> R<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> vector<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> we're

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
since R is the vector that we're

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.309 
since R is the vector that we're
changing<00:02:58.980> each<00:02:59.670> time<00:03:00.060> through<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.480> loop<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
changing each time through the loop the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.520 
changing each time through the loop the
spheres<00:03:01.590> position<00:03:02.100> will<00:03:02.280> change<00:03:02.579> accordingly

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
spheres position will change accordingly

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.589 
spheres position will change accordingly
running<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> program<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.849> see<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.420> is

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
running the program we see that this is

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.330 
running the program we see that this is
