00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello I am the jasmine from the store 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 and today I just want to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.510
 the differences between these 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.510
 beautiful we clearly instruments 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.510
 demonstrate 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 [Applause] 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 [Music] 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.850
 Ok, let's start with the synthesizers 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 the northern league 1 and the north invites four 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 the northern league 1 opposite the northern lights 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 four are the differences 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.440
 following the nordea 1 offers me 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.260
 26 votes during the Northern Song 420 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.720
 voices offer the spd concept 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.640
 the user interface is in operation 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.580
 northern league one slightly simpler 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 is very suitable for the stage 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 while I load four on the north 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.970
 really can go into more detail so 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.800
 Listen, all the soundtellers become ortlieb 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:30.880
 much better suited 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:33.950
 [Music] 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.549
 If you come to the not viano 2 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.000
 The north piano 2 has a base 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.770
 took 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.710
 the same structure as the stage 2 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.229
 the piano is exactly the same 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 Differences are here I have one 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.970
 sampling action with 120 28 mb around 50 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 agree with the north piano itself 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:21.880
 I create a teacher or a script 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:24.290
 [Music] 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.560
 due to many customer's wishes has clear 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.510
 we finally the north electro also 1 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.640
 viewpoint means we can 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.209
 now here two and at the same time 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.740
 available 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.319
 on the left, either the organ 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.560
 combine with the sampler or the 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.160
 pianos action with the sampler too 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.300
 Teacher is possible the organ in the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.270
 the north electric 5d is generation 3 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.320
 just like the northridge pot 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.440
 instrument the possibilities the organ 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.250
 by the way is full polyphonic sampling 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.730
 action offers me 256 megabytes here 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.310
 this disposal and the 15 votes 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.700
 pianos action is opposite to all 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.700
 let others the biggest with 1 gb 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.930
 Here we have the whole big flag of janus 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:31.520
 invite 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:31.520
 [Music] 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.290
 at northridge 2 we have the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.570
 possibility to learn to speak 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.370
 I can even choose two points here 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.620
 so compared to me three also that of 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.140
 to announce everything to the action 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.270
 The organ is taken in the basics 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.020
 same as we in the north electro 5 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.650
 The pianos action offers us 500 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.750
 mb and gives us 40 to 60 votes each 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.270
 after whether stereo pianos or mono 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.510
 pianos are the special feature we have 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.250
 here that is basically a 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:22.370
 stripped lothar 1 or nord invites 4 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:27.070
 we have 18 votes, the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.070
 classic waveforms sawtooth pulse 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.980
 fmf gables so among other things is located 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.740
 here in the sampler the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.540
 but then 380 mb is also big 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.450
 So much bigger than the others 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.130
 products as well as we can as well 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.410
 Include sexy clip 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.090
 for example, control sound module or 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.330
 with the computer, we combine have 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.310
 here again the external 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.530
 we do not take all that enough 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.350
 have slot a and b here 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.970
 local court that is I have quasi the 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.250
 organ twice available 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.200
 I have the piano available twice 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.600
 and twice as sexy in it too 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.030
 disposal can use these individually or 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.390
 Also as a teacher so that is at maximum 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.070
 six sounds at the same time come now 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.390
 of course, the question arises what is 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.030
 the right instrument for me 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.090
 Of course , I would like to have everyone for you 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.930
 The pianist, of course, offers himself in 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.669
 first line of the new yano 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.010
 excellent pianos and not the same 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.960
 In spite of that, I have his own even if now 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.880
 surface or nice string with it 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 So for most piano jobs or 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.120
 The north piano ranges from small club gigs 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.370
 to be the live musician for the heights 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.060
 setup for a second device for example 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.320
 I would like to expand the word 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.990
 tilt the electric 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.419
 I have here to the south horny organ piano 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.720
 piano sounds and come in the 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.810
 enjoy the samples and space for all 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.030
 those of you pure 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.460
 synthesizer sounds or simply searched 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.250
 a great solo or for her 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.090
 Production at home are the fat 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.950
 sounds that the northern league is the heart 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.890
 placed 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.140
 the flagship of the north sea I is two 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.820
 primarily for the live musician 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:23.200
 thought of simply top sound in one 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.840
 device requires the organ january piano 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:30.110
 Synthesizer and the whole can be 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.580
 Save combine sets so call 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.500
 that I give one or the other 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.210
 also deny with an instrument 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.830
 can 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.919
 Of course we are on the products 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.450
 now so short for one 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.070
 detailed advice or more 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.600
 of course I always ask questions 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.600
 gladly available 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.710
