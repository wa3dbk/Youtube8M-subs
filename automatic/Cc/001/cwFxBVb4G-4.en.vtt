00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
in our daily life we cannot avoid the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.040 
in our daily life we cannot avoid the
radiation<00:00:06.960> hum<00:00:07.230> which<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.220> bought<00:00:08.580> by

radiation hum which is bought by

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.620 
radiation hum which is bought by
household<00:00:10.050> appliances<00:00:11.330> such<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.410> cell<00:00:13.410> phone

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
household appliances such as cell phone

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:28.750 
household appliances such as cell phone
you<00:00:15.630> see<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> number<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.760> over<00:00:17.960> 700<00:00:21.560> 800<00:00:22.560> now

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.970 

and<00:00:28.880> printer

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.729 

it's<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:32.940> 1000<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.110> number<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.440> still

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it's over 1000 and the number is still

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.920 
it's over 1000 and the number is still
increasing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.360 

and<00:00:47.020> computer<00:00:47.860> Prince<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.120> most<00:00:49.360> radiation

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and computer Prince the most radiation

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.490 
and computer Prince the most radiation
is<00:00:51.370> over<00:00:51.910> 2,000

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.910 

therefore<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:01.180> produced<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.290> anti<00:01:02.680> radiation

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
therefore we produced the anti radiation

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.450 
therefore we produced the anti radiation
sticker<00:01:03.700> in<00:01:04.480> order<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:05.080> reduce<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.890> hump<00:01:06.130> to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
sticker in order to reduce the hump to

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.180 
sticker in order to reduce the hump to
human<00:01:06.970> body<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:10.260> let's<00:01:11.260> do<00:01:11.500> some<00:01:11.530> anti

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
human body now let's do some anti

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.070 
human body now let's do some anti
radiation<00:01:12.400> tests<00:01:13.150> on<00:01:13.300> those<00:01:14.290> appliances

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.109 

first<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.229> all<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:21.280> take<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.550> look<00:01:21.760> at<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
first of all we take a look at the

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.710 
first of all we take a look at the
radiation<00:01:22.660> tester<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:24.479> anti<00:01:25.479> radiation

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
radiation tester and anti radiation

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.190 
radiation tester and anti radiation
stickers<00:01:26.560> which<00:01:27.430> are<00:01:27.670> made<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> best<00:01:28.540> anti

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
stickers which are made of the best anti

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.700 
stickers which are made of the best anti
radiation<00:01:29.470> material<00:01:32.190> we<00:01:33.190> turn<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> tester

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
radiation material we turn on the tester

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.650 
radiation material we turn on the tester
the<00:01:35.710> number<00:01:36.070> shows<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.670> world<00:01:36.910> in<00:01:37.119> normal

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
the number shows the world in normal

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.219 
the number shows the world in normal
condition<00:01:38.550> use<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.790> cell<00:01:40.030> phone<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.869> start

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
condition use the cell phone to start

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.999 
condition use the cell phone to start
calling<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.880> number<00:01:42.910> goes<00:01:43.479> up<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.830> light

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
calling the number goes up the light

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.900 
calling the number goes up the light
gets<00:01:48.190> red<00:01:48.520> when<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.350> number<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.710> over<00:01:51.190> 2,000

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
gets red when the number is over 2,000

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.060 
gets red when the number is over 2,000
it<00:01:52.390> shows<00:01:52.690> one<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:55.750> we<00:01:55.810> use<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.320> sticker<00:01:56.770> to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
it shows one now we use the sticker to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.330 
it shows one now we use the sticker to
cover<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.640> test<00:01:57.910> area<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:59.470> number<00:01:59.770> goes<00:01:59.979> down

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
cover the test area the number goes down

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.419 
cover the test area the number goes down
immediately

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.899 

and<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.179> move<00:02:09.450> away<00:02:09.659> the<00:02:10.079> sticker<00:02:10.549> the<00:02:11.549> number

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
and we move away the sticker the number

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.910 
and we move away the sticker the number
goes<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.329> again

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.510 

next<00:02:16.670> let's<00:02:17.599> see<00:02:17.750> how<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.260> works<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
next let's see how it works to the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.729 
next let's see how it works to the
computer<00:02:20.000> screen<00:02:22.390> put<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.569> tester<00:02:24.050> near<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
computer screen put the tester near the

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.710 
computer screen put the tester near the
screen<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:26.030> number<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.569> increasing<00:02:26.810> rapidly

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
screen the number is increasing rapidly

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.979 
screen the number is increasing rapidly
now<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:30.530> use<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.980> sticker<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:32.360> cover<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
now we use the sticker to cover the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.180 
now we use the sticker to cover the
radiation<00:02:33.590> area<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:35.000> go<00:02:35.239> down<00:02:35.450> immediately

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.440 

okay<00:02:40.660> once<00:02:41.660> again

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:03:05.750 

you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.540 

then<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:07.420> try<00:03:07.720> once<00:03:08.080> more<00:03:08.200> on<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.980> printer

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:42.470 

same<00:03:12.550> effects<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.570> will<00:03:13.750> see

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.440 

okay<00:03:43.480> tests<00:03:44.110> completed<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.450> radiation

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
okay tests completed and the radiation

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.370 
okay tests completed and the radiation
function<00:03:47.170> works<00:03:51.690> remember<00:03:52.690> our<00:03:52.840> sticker

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
function works remember our sticker

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.680
