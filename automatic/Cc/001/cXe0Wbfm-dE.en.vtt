00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 today for those as we played 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 on the pokemon you chose during 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.290
 last votes and you've read magic 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 to magic the debt a pokemon who has 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.889
 always been moderately playing he has 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 long been part of the bunkers yesterday in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 rally or in india and laughing but with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 the arrival of Easter mistake x and the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 holidays it went down in digital for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 me a logical explanations to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.670
 this drop of third and the boost that has 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 received the act i sabotage in sixth 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 generation now sabotage in addition 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 to remove the object it 's very big 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.489
 damages 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 and the problem is that magic dreams he 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.880
 is extremely sensitive to this attack 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.590
 a lot of poutine who could not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 the kill the lover can now the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.309
 kill very easily with its beauty 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 I think that explains why he is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 become less and less play and that's 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.399
 even more blatant when he lingers 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.809
 on the magic statistics work on 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 see right away that he has very 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.250
 bad pv is a very bad defense 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.250
 well that's really going to mean he's going 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 to be very fragile on the physical plane 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 but in return we also note 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.199
 that he has a very good special attack 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.100
 a very good defense e special and a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.439
 very good speed 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 we can also note that magic dreams to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 a unique type rather by her the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 suspect has few weaknesses he has a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 immunity to attacks of the normal type and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 in addition to that since xy attacks the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 spectrum type will also hit the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 pokemon ah if that's pretty good 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 but the real magic advantage is that it looks 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 is going to be his mold ie the list 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.130
 attacks he can learn since 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.490
 dream magic will learn a lot of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.320
 things 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 there are two ways to play it they 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.579
 will come back very often 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.979
 offensive you'll have understood from the view of 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.750
 his defensive dream magic statistics in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.640
 any case on the physical plane it's not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 a very good idea 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 the first set you will see is 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.250
 something quite scalable 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.620
 we will benefit from the fact that he is learning 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.690
 a lot of attack we will play it with 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.940
 balloon to have an attack of his 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.400
 type a stab attack and we will use 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.710
 then very often magical shine that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.810
 allows to touch pokemon tm and 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 pokemon-type fighting very often in 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.990
 third player attack 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 choose ecosphere or thunder that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.710
 allows to have a very good coverage 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.390
 of type in last attack there are some 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.119
 very different choices that are possible 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.800
 and it will depend on your object what 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.540
 I personally prefer it's the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.610
 play with the glasses choice or the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.430
 handkerchief choice for attack booster 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.010
 special or speed and use the tax 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.510
 magic trick so eventually of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.850
 block installer a heritage 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.260
 defensive opponent but he is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.420
 also quite possible to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.709
 play with the computer and in this case there in 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.600
 last attack we will choose 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.100
 usually ray I like or still 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.560
 balance to regain a little bit 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.209
 slip sometimes we'll see it too with the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 jacket fight even if I do not like it too much 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.080
 this way of playing it and in this case 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.670
 there we last attack or choose radius 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.150
 charged who can increase his attack 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.250
 special 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.840
 as you see we have three ways of 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.560
 play my g rev that are noticeably 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.030
 different 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 when in the end they have the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 same attacks and room advantage it's 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
 that it will allow you to choose in 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 depending on your style of play and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.290
 your team 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.700
 it's good that's it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.320
 makes it easier for me 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.420
 times no matter how you 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.970
 play the breakdown of v will be pretty much 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.340
 always the same we will maximize the tax 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.350
 special and the speed there is only on 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.940
 the set with the combat jacket can be 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 possibly put a little bit 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.049
 had to get worse and defending this special 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.600
 to be more resistant to nature 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.640
 I advise you 6000 even if modest 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.950
 is possible if we come now 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.959
 on the second rather common way of 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.540
 play it a technique that will rest 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.220
 on a boost that must be based on 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.440
 machination machination it increases 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.450
 a lot the special pack of our magic 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.160
 dream and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.680
 good speed that can be all to 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.810
 is generally dangerous with this 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.400
 boost one will choose to use low shadow 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.560
 and magical shine as on the first 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.930
 set without really the best to touch 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.310
 the most kind of possible opponents to 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.200
 level of the last attack 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.360
 In my opinion, there are two possible choices in 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.209
 function of if you play simulator 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.550
 if you're on simulator consoles 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.349
 we will use cloning the purpose of this 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.360
 attack if to place it at the right time 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.549
 to be able to booster quietly 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.840
 being protected it also allows us 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.760
 a dream magic 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.370
 and as we have seen yet very fragile 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.620
 so here an opponents attack and of 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.060
 to be able to fight back once 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.799
 console so often a lot more 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.079
 complicated to place a clown as the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.269
 adversaries often very offensive too 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.130
 offensive so I advise you rather 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.320
 to choose a last attack at the bottom 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.060
 target as ecosphere or thunder of which 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.160
 we spoke earlier and play 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.290
 dream magic with the belt force that 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.400
 will work a lot on consoles seen 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.169
 that the rock traps are almost 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.790
 nonexistent in any case we meet 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.710
 random for others and that's 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.660
 exactly like the first set it takes 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.789
 maximize special attacks and speed 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.010
 for nature on the other hand shy 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.990
 only modest here it will not be 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.060
 really viable the purpose of these two 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.010
 methods will therefore be to place magic 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.750
 dream at the right time if possible in 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.580
 taking advantage of one of his units 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.650
 to note that there are some other options 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.080
 quite interesting I think by 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.760
 example provoc willow wolf oullins of 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.440
 care that can easily be added 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.200
 out of the seven that I presented to you 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.940
 be careful especially the seven except on this 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.450
 with the objects choice there is not 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.860
 possible 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.419
 but it's attacks can be 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.520
 quite practical in some cases 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.960
 you can quite consider it 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.880
 There are also other ways to 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 play my jld way a little bit more 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.750
 rare that they will use for example cage 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.389
 is clear that the request is a requiem 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.710
 or else crazy round but watch out these 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.129
 attacks there we can not transplant 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.679
 on the 2.7 that I hate you 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.089
 presented or with difficulty what 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.889
 I advise you so it's 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.389
 consult the strategic sheet that I 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.919
 put you in the details of the video 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.889
 where you will have all the explanations 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.139
 6-1 6-7 a different type interests you 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.300
 to accompany him if you are on 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.860
 simulator so we came I you 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.050
 advise to leave often pokemon 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.849
 normal with a good defense like that 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.289
 at the level of the balance of 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.610
 statistics one is not bad of the 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.559
 all there are several who 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.989
 match the profile there I think 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.089
 for example to and creamy or tongue or 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.439
 even regis gasse if you are on 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.689
 console and you do not necessarily have 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.309
 want to respect the thirds you can 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.080
 also leave on pokemon like 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.059
 nathalie what she prey or 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.129
 score sheets I will end this video 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.529
 with a little digression towards what we 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.419
 can say in poké science supernumerate it 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.249
 there is a theory that magic 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.080
 dream would be the undervaluation of dark 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.279
 reign in you the rope said like that 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.779
 it's a little far- fetched 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.249
 but there are really a lot of arguments 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.169
 for just as there are also some 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.459
 arguments against and even if I believe in it 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.659
 not necessarily I push to always 

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.399
 interesting to debate 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.050
 especially do not hesitate if you have a 

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.039
 opinion on this theory to share it 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.869
 in the comments 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.099
 and I on my side I hope you 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:23.029
 will have enjoyed what my game but I 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.749
 tell you very soon 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.749
 from video
