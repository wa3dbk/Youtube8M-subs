00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it and I like that goal because he

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.930 
it and I like that goal because he
doesn't<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.810> such<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> good<00:02:59.560> power<00:03:00.310> he

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
doesn't have such a good power he

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.599 
doesn't have such a good power he
doesn't<00:03:01.209> have<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.359> good<00:03:01.599> power<00:03:01.780> shot<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:03.129> this

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
doesn't have a good power shot so this

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.490 
doesn't have a good power shot so this
