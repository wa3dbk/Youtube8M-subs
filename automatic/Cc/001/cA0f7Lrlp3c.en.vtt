00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello hello and cordially 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.000
 Welcome to a little info video 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.099
 Regarding the new program updates it 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 a lot has happened on the market and 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 Although the tanks are now more recently 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
 or, more recently, not only of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.180
 wheels but also of reasonable 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 be driven chains 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 which makes me really happy because with 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 you finally find time for it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.720
 actually what you with armor as 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.420
 First outfitter, at least I would 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.740
 do in a petty world and we 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 are good, the whole runs from t3 to 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.520
 tcf with me until now just because I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 I do not even know if the child is fast 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 I did not even pick it up, I can not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.690
 i do not know no i can not because 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 I can not do it at all 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 not at all, because I am at all 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 no class and the things are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.219
 heavily armored and hold so 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
 Accordingly, weigh and weigh so much 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.620
 so much and the things are natural 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 totally slow what did not really me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.739
 wondering that these were not the only ones 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 Renewals the second larger a few 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 more but the second bigger one is quasi 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.380
 a new weapon category that turns out to be 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.030
 secondary weapon means that means one 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 can you with each other you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 wants to combine and is quasi passive 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.659
 that's the tablet over in stage d 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.450
 1800 etc etc not every time somehow 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 a riddle which word must speak 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 and is almost meant to frame like 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 many medium access programs almost with 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.780
 the thing in front of his mother then 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.250
 some other opponent and mast in the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.509
 massively harm 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 and that as I before ever 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.009
 looked exactly the double of akon 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 is actually only for 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.280
 one-time use thought or 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.079
 course in the next two stages 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.750
 for twice and three times in use 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.220
 so wise to use but otherwise have 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.869
 I'm a pretty fat thing because of me 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 believe that things are not that expensive 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.460
 but will stop accordingly 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 if you get close to it so much harm 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 then just rammed once or briefly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 again just here with the short 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 should be postponed to the plasma 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 big gaps in the opponent 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.590
 defense is the only disadvantage 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.130
 is a shot on it and the thing is 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.560
 also brought away 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.280
 so be careful then there is still 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.610
 two new robots will do a t3 tracks 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 Here a three robots with the chain 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.050
 path locomotive here and a t 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.819
 7 tesla blade just right 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.380
 designed is a hammer of the things 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.390
 turn it on to the others 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.950
 I do not know if I scratch now 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:39.250
 just draufkommen robo shop are they 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:42.870
 Almost as close as zoe how cool 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.910
 the thing out of here, why the thing has yes 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.099
 Well, that's not what I think 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.959
 have searched 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.299
 right here the tea 7 that's the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.019
 tesla the time just let's see if the thing 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.700
 works pretty well 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.430
 the thing should work and here 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.940
 we have just the appropriate with 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.959
 then his chains and down her 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.730
 See who are relatively large the parts 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.160
 because of that too much and so archaic 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.190
 These are also cool the fair at the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.810
 I do not believe that we do 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.100
 somehow I knocked over 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.739
 faith will always stick to the floor 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.540
 how else has I liked everyone 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.549
 both of them are pretty much no 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.230
 pretty good and I would say there 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 I also enough for the little one 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 there are a few new ones so one 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.690
 a bit if it's in things so 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.880
 probably now is the weird 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 What's the name of it? 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.859
 quite as op i just know it 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.310
 not anymore so i just know 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.959
 no more 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 Oh, I know, I do not know what to do next 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.560
 plasma landscape but no matter on everyone 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.450
 Do not balance in things and a 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 it was a little something to the config dat 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.850
 actually already more was now 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.079
 do not leave me that's why I say 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.900
 a certain already see you 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.700
 possibly first robocop park or im 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.829
 next announcement video to what also 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.609
 always easy looking around until denne 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.609
 trust
