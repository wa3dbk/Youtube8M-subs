00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 

what<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.200> wanted<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> say<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.790> been

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
what I wanted to say was I've been

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
what I wanted to say was I've been
thinking<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.570> lot<00:00:57.600> about<00:00:58.020> you<00:01:01.309> think<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.400> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
thinking a lot about you think about you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.980 
thinking a lot about you think about you
too

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.790 

our<00:01:08.530> group<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.310> small<00:01:09.579> you're<00:01:10.570> slow

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.300 

you're<00:01:16.400> convicted<00:01:16.970> killer<00:01:17.210> Carly<00:01:17.930> Jesus<00:01:18.770> and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you're convicted killer Carly Jesus and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.730 
you're convicted killer Carly Jesus and
I<00:01:19.490> think<00:01:19.730> people<00:01:19.940> should<00:01:20.120> know<00:01:20.570> not<00:01:21.410> because

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
I think people should know not because

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.590 
I think people should know not because
they<00:01:21.920> deserves<00:01:22.370> you<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.880> not<00:01:23.030> because<00:01:23.390> you're

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
they deserves you and not because you're

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.410 
they deserves you and not because you're
a<00:01:23.660> bad<00:01:23.930> man<00:01:24.230> I<00:01:24.610> think<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.760> opposite<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.240> those

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
a bad man I think the opposite of those

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.340 
a bad man I think the opposite of those
two<00:01:26.630> things<00:01:28.570> people<00:01:29.570> need<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:29.930> know<00:01:30.080> because

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
two things people need to know because

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.110 
two things people need to know because
we're<00:01:30.620> hanging<00:01:30.950> by<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> thread<00:01:31.250> here<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:31.970> I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
we're hanging by a thread here and I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.970 
we're hanging by a thread here and I
can't<00:01:32.510> see<00:01:32.720> Lily<00:01:32.990> talk<00:01:33.320> about<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.710> without

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
can't see Lily talk about you without

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.530 
can't see Lily talk about you without
thinking<00:01:34.220> it's<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.670> next<00:01:35.000> thing<00:01:35.210> she's<00:01:35.420> going

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
thinking it's the next thing she's going

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.780 
thinking it's the next thing she's going
to<00:01:35.750> say<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.950> don't<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.310> tell<00:01:37.490> everyone

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
to say you don't have to tell everyone

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.330 
to say you don't have to tell everyone
but<00:01:38.540> think<00:01:38.990> about<00:01:39.080> who<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.530> trust<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.130> take

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
but think about who you trust and take

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.020 
but think about who you trust and take
the<00:01:40.490> opportunity<00:01:41.180> while<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.510> have<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:43.030> you're

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
the opportunity while you have it you're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.150 
the opportunity while you have it you're
probably<00:01:44.360> right<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:45.470> course<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:45.950> probably

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
probably right of course I'm probably

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.720 
probably right of course I'm probably
right<00:01:47.110> people<00:01:48.110> might<00:01:48.320> be<00:01:48.470> pissed<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.040> telling

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
right people might be pissed and telling

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.070 
right people might be pissed and telling
them<00:01:49.850> might<00:01:50.030> cause<00:01:50.240> some<00:01:50.270> trouble<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:50.960> it

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
them might cause some trouble but it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.600 
them might cause some trouble but it
will<00:01:51.200> be<00:01:51.230> a<00:01:51.320> far<00:01:51.560> cry<00:01:51.800> from<00:01:51.890> what<00:01:52.100> will<00:01:52.280> happen

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
will be a far cry from what will happen

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.160 
will be a far cry from what will happen
if<00:01:52.700> they<00:01:52.790> don't<00:01:52.970> hear<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.210> from<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.540> yeah<00:01:56.170> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
never going to be a good time but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
never going to be a good time but
they're<00:02:49.010> going<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> lot<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.670> bad<00:02:50.030> ones

they're going to be a lot of bad ones

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.720 
they're going to be a lot of bad ones
right<00:02:50.600> now<00:02:51.530> doesn't<00:02:51.770> seem<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.280> one<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.520> them

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
right now doesn't seem like one of them

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.480 
right now doesn't seem like one of them
but<00:02:53.450> everyone's<00:02:53.990> different<00:02:54.230> who<00:02:54.980> knows<00:02:55.220> how

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
but everyone's different who knows how

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.520 
but everyone's different who knows how
each<00:02:55.670> person<00:02:56.030> would<00:02:56.180> take<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.570> know<00:02:56.720> maybe

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
each person would take it you know maybe

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.870 
each person would take it you know maybe
it's<00:02:57.650> worth<00:02:57.830> thinking<00:02:57.890> about<00:02:58.280> who<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.670> want

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880
