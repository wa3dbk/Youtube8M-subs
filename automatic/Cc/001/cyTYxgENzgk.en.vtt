00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.609
 so actually here is the bumper almost 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.300
 assembled 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.200
 that part is delivered the honor delivered 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:19.150
 the bumper itself is already separate itself 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.630
 Funny nuts 88 year too old 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:28.000
 still holding a little bitten banker 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:32.859
 it was already but life will be fine here 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.190
 it remains only to fasten what were 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:40.329
 small problem is obtained in 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.579
 In principle, the fig is not visible nonsense of these 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.659
 here are the side screens that responsibly 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.780
 governors 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.339
 the clouds I had one side broken off 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.440
 there are plastic parts 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.039
 mounts these plastic mounts 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.899
 rolled a hair dryer that is, there are two 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.179
 chips render illustration of an old bumper 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.069
 on laptop from bumper 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.469
 I'm from these two who are there when they pony 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.079
 the values ​​were few and here on this 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.299
 the concrete is also broken in the bar 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:10.479
 2 who are not soldered here, and they apparently 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:16.060
 repair were factory and now on them I 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:22.390
 planted this side rail already 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:26.380
 finished hair about the bumper itself 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:33.149
 still there is mounted on such here we are not 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.149
 screws and rivets, rivet here costs 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.299
 bolt and plastic bead with these things 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.290
 they get you snuggle up 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.940
 pad is pressed against the bumper 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.800
 well, since this is a very bad idea 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.890
 therefore, due to it, it is kept very 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.730
 firmly it does not go with the pad does not 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.690
 walks the oil side as i stood 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.980
 Hunter just does not get out of anything 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.610
 I can’t touch them either 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.460
 gave out with a hammer now I think replace 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.160
 them on the bolt and most likely therefore 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.800
 craftsman will change the bumper look here 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.880
 such a kit of either these rivets or 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.250
 take the bolts and no longer fasten 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.610
 back bumper cover all so far on 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.610
 that's all
