00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
going to show you how to make panels on

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to show you how to make panels on
offense<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.079> just<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:50.800> fence<00:00:51.010> line<00:00:51.220> so<00:00:51.940> this<00:00:52.120> is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
offense and just a fence line so this is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.020 
offense and just a fence line so this is
13<00:00:53.260> bosco<00:00:53.590> six<00:00:53.829> are<00:00:54.070> going<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.310> be<00:00:54.399> making<00:00:54.550> a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
13 bosco six are going to be making a

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.510 
13 bosco six are going to be making a
hole<00:00:55.780> for<00:00:56.739> panel<00:00:57.840> line<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.649> that<00:00:59.950> is<00:01:00.160> what<00:01:00.489> i

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
hole for panel line so that is what i

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.569 
hole for panel line so that is what i
normally<00:01:00.640> do<00:01:01.059> for<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.420> larger<00:01:01.780> vs<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.860> let's<00:01:03.460> go

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
normally do for a larger vs so let's go

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.530 
normally do for a larger vs so let's go
ahead<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.730> it's<00:01:03.880> right<00:01:04.170> ok<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.409> for<00:01:05.619> each<00:01:06.540> pan

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
ahead and it's right ok so for each pan

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.850 
ahead and it's right ok so for each pan
or<00:01:07.719> you're<00:01:07.840> going<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.990> need<00:01:08.140> for<00:01:08.409> popsicle

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
so you're going to just pick some glue

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.899 
so you're going to just pick some glue
on<00:01:37.180> each<00:01:37.630> end<00:01:37.840> your<00:01:38.170> popsicle<00:01:38.680> stick<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
on each end your popsicle stick like

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.800 
on each end your popsicle stick like
that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.310 

and<00:01:46.810> then<00:01:47.170> flip<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:47.830> over<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.960> glue<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:49.990> down

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.930 

like<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.979> we're<00:01:54.310> going<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.490> try<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.670> get<00:01:54.820> it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
like that we're going to try to get it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.770 
like that we're going to try to get it
nice<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.450> straight<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:58.570> pretty

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
nice and straight so that's pretty

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.140 
nice and straight so that's pretty
stupid<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:02.050> there's<00:02:02.259> our<00:02:02.500> bottom<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.580> like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
stupid so there's our bottom one like

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.150 
stupid so there's our bottom one like
yet<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:08.500> you're<00:02:08.649> just<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.009> take

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
yet and now you're just going to take

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.790 
yet and now you're just going to take
the<00:02:09.399> top<00:02:09.580> piece<00:02:09.850> put<00:02:10.450> some<00:02:10.660> glue<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:11.260> each<00:02:11.560> end

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the top piece put some glue on each end

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.160 
the top piece put some glue on each end
of<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:14.670> glue<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:15.850> as<00:02:16.060> well<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:17.110> just

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
of it and glue it down as well you just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
of it and glue it down as well you just
going<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.410> glue<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.560> towards<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> top<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to glue it towards the top and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.229 
going to glue it towards the top and
they<00:02:22.840> work<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.110> out<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.700> careful<00:02:25.060> thought

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
they work it out the careful thought

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.030 
they work it out the careful thought
they've<00:02:25.420> been<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:26.260> careful<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.769> hot<00:02:26.890> glue

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
they've been be careful with a hot glue

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.500 
they've been be careful with a hot glue
and<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.400> hurts<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.370> there's<00:02:30.519> one<00:02:30.850> panel<00:02:31.330> of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
and it hurts so there's one panel of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.930 
and it hurts so there's one panel of
your<00:02:31.780> fencing<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.650> about<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
your fencing and it is about this is a

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.620 
your fencing and it is about this is a
large<00:02:34.300> large<00:02:34.959> classic<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.769> it's<00:02:35.920> about<00:02:36.190> there

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
large large classic and it's about there

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.360 
large large classic and it's about there
right<00:02:37.630> at<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.840> shoulder<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.220> pretty

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
right at the shoulder so that's pretty

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.320 
right at the shoulder so that's pretty

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.580 
one you're going to be putting it
underneath<00:05:18.340> so<00:05:19.720> put<00:05:20.720> your<00:05:20.900> glue<00:05:21.080> top<00:05:21.380> and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
underneath so put your glue top and

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.020 
underneath so put your glue top and
bottom<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.690> pull<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.750> down<00:05:23.870> right<00:05:24.020> there

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
bottom and pull it down right there

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.980 
bottom and pull it down right there
hopefully<00:05:26.030> my<00:05:26.060> face<00:05:26.330> isn't<00:05:26.600> getting<00:05:26.780> in<00:05:26.930> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
hopefully my face isn't getting in the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.090 
hopefully my face isn't getting in the
way<00:05:27.080> i<00:05:27.110> noticed<00:05:27.500> that<00:05:27.560> while<00:05:27.740> i<00:05:27.800> was<00:05:27.890> doing<00:05:28.010> my

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
way i noticed that while i was doing my

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.980 
way i noticed that while i was doing my
halter<00:05:28.520> i'll<00:05:29.030> probably<00:05:29.270> end<00:05:29.390> up<00:05:29.510> redoing<00:05:29.840> my

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
halter i'll probably end up redoing my

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.710 
halter i'll probably end up redoing my
halter<00:05:30.380> once<00:05:30.590> because<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:31.040> sucked<00:05:31.370> but<00:05:32.030> yeah
