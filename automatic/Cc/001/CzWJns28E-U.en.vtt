00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.710 

course<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.410> crashes<00:00:01.890> are<00:00:02.129> just<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.669> lot<00:00:03.659> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
course the crashes are just a lot of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.599 
course the crashes are just a lot of
different<00:00:04.040> crashes<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.160> then<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.370> course

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
different crashes and then of course

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.070 
different crashes and then of course
you've<00:00:05.970> got<00:00:06.440> some<00:00:07.440> great<00:00:08.570> little<00:00:09.570> choices

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
you've got some great little choices

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.980 
you've got some great little choices
here<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.759> if<00:00:11.759> i<00:00:11.910> go<00:00:11.940> into<00:00:12.440> crashes<00:00:17.900> there's<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
here so if i go into crashes there's a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.010 
here so if i go into crashes there's a
nice<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.289> right<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.460> I've<00:00:20.609> got<00:00:20.820> my

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
nice one right there so I've got my

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.779 
nice one right there so I've got my
reverb<00:00:22.020> decay<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.769> got<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.449> reverb<00:00:24.449> amount

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
reverb decay I've got my reverb amount

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:35.740 
reverb decay I've got my reverb amount
no<00:00:26.789> reverb<00:00:27.590> lots<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.830> reverb<00:00:32.870> short<00:00:33.870> decay

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
no reverb lots of reverb short decay

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
no reverb lots of reverb short decay
long<00:00:36.750> decay<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.020> transpose<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:53.000> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
long decay and we can transpose it and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
long decay and we can transpose it and
we've<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:54.840> decay<00:00:55.140> time<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:05.729> pan

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
we've got some decay time you could pan

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.480 
we've got some decay time you could pan
it<00:01:06.299> into<00:01:06.600> whatever<00:01:06.960> stereo<00:01:07.799> field<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.280> want

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it into whatever stereo field you want

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.030 
it into whatever stereo field you want
and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:11.060> will<00:01:12.060> make<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.360> sample

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
and then this here will make the sample

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:23.149 
and then this here will make the sample
more<00:01:14.040> stereo<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> middle<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:21.890> that's<00:01:22.890> for

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
more stereo in the middle and that's for

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
more stereo in the middle and that's for
every<00:01:23.460> crash<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.170> gives<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
every crash on here so that gives you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
every crash on here so that gives you
tons<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.890> choices<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> same<00:01:29.970> goes<00:01:30.000> here

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
tons of choices and the same goes here

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
tons of choices and the same goes here
for<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> synth<00:01:32.549> crashes<00:01:33.060> only<00:01:33.329> you've<00:01:33.450> got

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
for the synth crashes only you've got

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
for the synth crashes only you've got
some<00:01:34.229> different<00:01:34.590> options<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.100> things<00:01:35.310> like

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
some different options and things like

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149 
some different options and things like
that<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.850> still<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.890> reverbs<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that but you still have reverbs and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:53.440 
that but you still have reverbs and
decays<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> different<00:01:39.150> things<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.789 

we<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.600> quite<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> bit<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> reverb<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.590> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
we got quite a bit of reverb there we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.300 
we got quite a bit of reverb there we
could<00:01:55.950> turn<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.189> reverb<00:01:56.460> off<00:02:04.009> add<00:02:05.009> some

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
could turn the reverb off add some

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:19.069 
could turn the reverb off add some
resonated<00:02:09.410> reverb<00:02:15.769> fun<00:02:16.769> stuff
