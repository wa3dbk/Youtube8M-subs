from<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.549> deck<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> top<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> deck<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
from your deck to the top of the deck so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
from your deck to the top of the deck so
it's<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.509> good<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:40.619> 1,800

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it's pretty good actually got 1,800

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's pretty good actually got 1,800
attack<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.960> hard<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.350> over

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
attack so it's a little hard to get over

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
attack so it's a little hard to get over
which<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.369> why<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> only<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.240> running<00:01:45.540> too

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
which is why I only like running too

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
which is why I only like running too
though<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.799> has<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> searchability

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
though because it has the searchability

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.399 
though because it has the searchability
but<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> doesn't<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.299> pop<00:01:48.600> anything<00:01:48.960> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but it doesn't really pop anything so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
but it doesn't really pop anything so
you<00:01:49.439> can't<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.009> too<00:01:50.220> many<00:01:50.399> plays<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you can't get too many plays off with it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
you can't get too many plays off with it
you<00:01:51.270> can't<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.810> search<00:01:52.490> I'm<00:01:53.490> also

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you can't really get search I'm also

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
you can't really get search I'm also

face-up you excavate the top five cards
your<00:02:53.970> deck<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.630> really<00:02:54.930> sets<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> lot

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
your deck so that really sets up a lot

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.860

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.280

most<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.010> monsters<00:04:58.430> in<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.760> deck<00:04:59.030> our

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
most of the monsters in this deck our

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.690 
most of the monsters in this deck our
plant<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.110> miracle<00:05:00.650> fertilizers<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.310> lot<00:05:01.550> more

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700

consistent<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.630> also<00:05:02.750> like<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.230> because<00:05:03.260> if

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
consistent and I also like it because if

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.640 
consistent and I also like it because if
miracle<00:05:04.370> fertilizer<00:05:04.820> is<00:05:05.240> destroyed<00:05:05.810> unlike

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
away pretty much when the monster leaves

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.340

miracle<00:05:11.000> fertilizer<00:05:11.420> goes<00:05:11.750> away<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.080> you

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
your monster in the process so I really

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.430

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
like that play plus I run 1141 pretty

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.930 
like that play plus I run 1141 pretty
much<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.770> could<00:05:21.920> search<00:05:22.100> copy<00:05:22.400> plant<00:05:22.700> or

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
much you could search copy plant or

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.580 
much you could search copy plant or
peacekeeper<00:05:23.480> with<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:23.750> card<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.290> get<00:05:24.410> off

peacekeepers<00:05:25.130> effect<00:05:25.430> if<00:05:25.580> possible<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.270> I

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
peacekeepers effect if possible and I

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.320 
peacekeepers effect if possible and I
also<00:05:27.050> run<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.920> reasoning<00:05:28.460> they<00:05:28.820> change<00:05:29.090> the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
also run to reasoning they change the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.910 
also run to reasoning they change the
car<00:05:29.510> text<00:05:29.870> for<00:05:29.990> this<00:05:30.080> card<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.500> now<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.740> does

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
car text for this card so now it does

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.650 
car text for this card so now it does
say<00:05:31.130> activate<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.150> makes<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.450> deck<00:05:32.630> a

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
say activate it just makes the deck a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.450 
say activate it just makes the deck a
lot<00:05:33.050> more<00:05:33.230> pliable<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.890> pretty<00:05:34.100> much<00:05:34.280> your

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
lot more pliable and pretty much your

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.210 
lot more pliable and pretty much your
opponent<00:05:34.910> has<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.330> really<00:05:36.080> guess<00:05:36.530> because<00:05:36.920> all

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
opponent has to really guess because all

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.920 
opponent has to really guess because all
the<00:05:37.430> Sylvan<00:05:37.790> monsters<00:05:38.210> have<00:05:38.390> different

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
the Sylvan monsters have different

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.660 
the Sylvan monsters have different
levels<00:05:39.260> there's<00:05:39.470> almost<00:05:39.710> pretty<00:05:40.130> much<00:05:40.340> one

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
levels there's almost pretty much one

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.120 
levels there's almost pretty much one
for<00:05:40.910> every<00:05:41.210> if<00:05:41.390> not<00:05:41.690> I<00:05:42.110> think<00:05:42.800> there's<00:05:43.010> just

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
for every if not I think there's just

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.250 
for every if not I think there's just
not<00:05:43.310> like<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.580> level<00:05:43.910> five<00:05:44.120> six<00:05:44.600> or<00:05:44.720> seven<00:05:45.050> but

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
not like a level five six or seven but

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.930 
not like a level five six or seven but
pretty<00:05:45.680> much<00:05:45.740> your<00:05:46.160> opponent<00:05:46.520> has<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.700> be

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
pretty much your opponent has to be

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.280 
pretty much your opponent has to be
afraid<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.240> any<00:05:47.450> other<00:05:47.660> card<00:05:47.870> plus<00:05:48.170> the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
afraid of any other card plus the

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.580 
afraid of any other card plus the
dragons<00:05:48.770> are<00:05:48.890> level<00:05:49.220> 7<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:50.050> there's<00:05:51.050> really<00:05:51.230> no

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
dragons are level 7 so there's really no

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.500 
dragons are level 7 so there's really no
easy<00:05:51.620> choice<00:05:52.340> for<00:05:52.370> them<00:05:52.670> to<00:05:52.790> pick<00:05:52.970> they<00:05:53.330> gotta

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
easy choice for them to pick they gotta

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.270 
easy choice for them to pick they gotta
be<00:05:53.630> careful<00:05:53.780> with<00:05:54.110> those<00:05:54.230> players<00:05:54.500> plus<00:05:54.830> if

be careful with those players plus if

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
they do get it wrong all those cards
