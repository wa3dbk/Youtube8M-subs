desire for their their children I
certainly<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.720> children<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
certainly have it for my children and I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
certainly have it for my children and I
want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.340> sure<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
want to make sure that they have the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.929 
want to make sure that they have the
same<00:01:55.049> opportunities<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.759> maybe

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
same opportunities that I had or maybe

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.870 
same opportunities that I had or maybe
even<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.229> easier<00:01:58.850> given<00:01:59.850> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
even have a little bit easier given that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.819 
even have a little bit easier given that
I<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.899> farther<00:02:01.170> along<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
I got a little little farther along it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
I got a little little farther along it
becomes<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.000> yourself<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.750> your

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
becomes not just you yourself it's your

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
becomes not just you yourself it's your
whole<00:02:03.990> family<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.490> stuck<00:02:05.729> with

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
whole family now I think that stuck with

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.819 
whole family now I think that stuck with
my<00:02:06.030> sister<00:02:06.390> how<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> inspire<00:02:07.110> her<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.619> back

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
my sister how to inspire her to go back

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.309 
my sister how to inspire her to go back
later<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.259> very

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
later and do that so I think it's very

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.650 
later and do that so I think it's very
much<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> family

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
much a family

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.170 
much a family
a<00:02:11.810> family<00:02:12.650> achievement<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.730> an

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
a family achievement it's not just an

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.770 
a family achievement it's not just an
individual<00:02:14.750> getting<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.620> diploma
