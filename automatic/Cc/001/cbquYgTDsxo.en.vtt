every bit of detail I can you know and
again<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> suppose<00:00:21.060> growing<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.960> very

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
again I suppose growing up I was very

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
again I suppose growing up I was very
much<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> technical<00:00:22.980> person<00:00:23.519> terms

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
much a bit of a technical person terms

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.370 
much a bit of a technical person terms
of<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.210> batting<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.720> wanted<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> look

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
of my batting I wanted it to look

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.279 
of my batting I wanted it to look
perfect<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:28.050> into

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
perfect and I think actually going into

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
perfect and I think actually going into
it<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> realize<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.310> more<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.699> play<00:00:30.170> again<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
it you realize the more you play again I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
it you realize the more you play again I
said<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.859> looks<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.279> really

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
said it's not what it looks like really

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.600 
said it's not what it looks like really
it's<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.850> how<00:00:33.300> many<00:00:33.510> runs<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it's about how many runs and you know I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's about how many runs and you know I
think<00:00:35.700> gradually<00:00:36.390> over<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> time<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> my

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
think gradually over the time in my

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
think gradually over the time in my
career<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.559> I've<00:00:37.770> tried<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.399> away<00:00:38.520> from

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
career that I've tried to go away from

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
career that I've tried to go away from
just<00:00:39.239> worrying<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.629> technique<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
just worrying about technique and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.720 
just worrying about technique and
looking<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> looks<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.430> obviously

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
looking what it looks like obviously

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
looking what it looks like obviously
technique<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.450> important<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
technique is really important and to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.840 
technique is really important and to
play<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> highest<00:00:44.129> level<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
play at the highest level you have to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.990 
play at the highest level you have to
have<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> good<00:00:45.120> technique<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> also<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have a good technique and and also you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.799 
have a good technique and and also you
learn<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.570> lots<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> different

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
learn that there's lots of different

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.080 
learn that there's lots of different
ways<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> big<00:00:50.039> successful<00:00:50.460> there's<00:00:50.760> no<00:00:50.850> right

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
ways to big successful there's no right

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.750 
ways to big successful there's no right
right<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.629> wrong<00:00:51.840> way<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.430> but<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.520> focus

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
right or wrong way and but my focus

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459 
right or wrong way and but my focus
really<00:00:54.149> came<00:00:54.420> away<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> obviously<00:00:55.379> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
really came away from that obviously I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.319 
really came away from that obviously I
still<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.059> you're
