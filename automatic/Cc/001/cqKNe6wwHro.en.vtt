00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
but you can also build up experience

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
things to develop new skill sets but the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
things to develop new skill sets but the
problem<00:01:05.489> i<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:06.600> faces

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
problem i think a lot of people faces

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
problem i think a lot of people faces
the<00:01:07.170> skill<00:01:07.439> sets<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.860> feel<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.220> you're

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the skill sets don't feel like you're

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
the skill sets don't feel like you're
doing<00:01:09.299> new<00:01:09.540> button<00:01:10.049> moves<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.740> basically<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
doing new button moves so basically you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
doing new button moves so basically you
still<00:01:11.729> tap<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.210> buttons<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> get

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
still tap the same buttons to get

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
still tap the same buttons to get
different<00:01:13.110> set<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> skill<00:01:13.979> sets<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
different set of skill sets so just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
different set of skill sets so just
looking<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> expanse<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.290> see

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

each<00:03:52.090> different<00:03:52.359> part<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.380> that's<00:03:53.590> something

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
each different part so that's something

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.220

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
that I think it's a nice feature in the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.690 
that I think it's a nice feature in the
feature<00:03:56.560> set<00:03:56.769> in<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:56.980> game<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.340> they've<00:03:57.430> done

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
feature set in the game and they've done

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.199 
feature set in the game and they've done
very<00:03:57.760> very<00:03:58.180> well<00:03:58.390> now<00:03:59.109> this<00:03:59.739> is<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.209> regular

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
that slow motion sequence and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.600 
that slow motion sequence and
graphically<00:04:09.250> looks<00:04:09.489> great<00:04:09.760> as<00:04:09.879> it<00:04:10.060> zoom

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
graphically looks great as it zoom

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.030 
graphically looks great as it zoom
into<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.270> aspect<00:04:11.480> now<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.410> game<00:04:12.590> has<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.770> lot

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
into that aspect now the game has a lot

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.130 
into that aspect now the game has a lot
of<00:04:13.070> different<00:04:13.240> worlds<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.270> arenas<00:04:14.720> one<00:04:14.960> thing

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
of different worlds and arenas one thing

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.370 
of different worlds and arenas one thing
I<00:04:15.260> will<00:04:15.440> mention<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.980> game<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.400> kind<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.850> short

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
I will mention the game is kind of short

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.050 
I will mention the game is kind of short
so<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.650> something<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.400> already<00:04:19.880> had

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
so that is something that I already had

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.150 
so that is something that I already had
to<00:04:20.239> reach<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.959> third<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.470> game<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.829> about

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to reach the third of the game in about

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880 
to reach the third of the game in about
an<00:04:22.310> hour<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.440> two-thirds<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> gate<00:04:24.860> I

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
an hour so and two-thirds of the gate I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.560 
an hour so and two-thirds of the gate I
mean<00:04:25.130> about<00:04:25.250> almost<00:04:25.700> halfway<00:04:25.910> through<00:04:26.090> in

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
mean about almost halfway through in

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.450 
mean about almost halfway through in
about<00:04:26.690> about<00:04:27.500> two<00:04:27.710> hours<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> think<00:04:28.190> games

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
about about two hours so I think games

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.240 
about about two hours so I think games
about<00:04:28.700> four<00:04:29.000> hours<00:04:29.060> long<00:04:29.450> in<00:04:29.840> total<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
about four hours long in total and and

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.040 
about four hours long in total and and
that's<00:04:31.820> something<00:04:32.000> that's<00:04:32.240> quite<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> bummer

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that's something that's quite a bummer

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.170 
that's something that's quite a bummer
but<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.830> do<00:04:33.950> have<00:04:34.070> different<00:04:34.250> locales<00:04:34.820> and

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
but you do have different locales and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.470 
but you do have different locales and
scenery<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.550> know<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.790> effects<00:04:38.090> again<00:04:38.360> like

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
scenery and know the effects again like

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.420 
scenery and know the effects again like
I<00:04:38.540> said<00:04:38.570> they<00:04:38.870> vary<00:04:39.200> from<00:04:39.410> time<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.800> time<00:04:39.830> and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
I said they vary from time to time and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.160 
I said they vary from time to time and
we<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.640> see<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.910> grassy<00:04:41.210> area<00:04:41.600> looks<00:04:41.810> so

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
we can see that grassy area looks so

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.610 
we can see that grassy area looks so
rich<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:42.650> full<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:44.390> this<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.380> little

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
rich and so full and this is a little

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.860 
rich and so full and this is a little
bland<00:04:46.010> but<00:04:46.400> there's<00:04:46.940> some<00:04:47.030> areas<00:04:47.390> within<00:04:47.570> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
bland but there's some areas within the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.380 
bland but there's some areas within the
stage<00:04:48.140> when<00:04:48.470> something<00:04:48.919> looks<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:49.490> dynamic<00:04:50.180> so

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
stage when something looks so dynamic so
