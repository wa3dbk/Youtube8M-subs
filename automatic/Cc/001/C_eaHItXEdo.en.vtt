here we are at the club through the lab
we<00:00:05.069> are<00:00:05.250> testing<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.060> 68<00:00:06.960> 70<00:00:07.470> affinity<00:00:07.980> six<00:00:08.189> card

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
we are testing a 68 70 affinity six card

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.530 
we are testing a 68 70 affinity six card
you<00:00:09.780> can<00:00:09.900> see<00:00:10.200> all<00:00:10.410> those<00:00:10.730> mini<00:00:11.730> DisplayPort

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
you can see all those mini DisplayPort

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.310 
you can see all those mini DisplayPort
connectors<00:00:15.500> we<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.730> affinity<00:00:18.300> 6<00:00:18.869> screen

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
connectors we have the affinity 6 screen

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.790 
connectors we have the affinity 6 screen
here<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:20.670> doing<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.270> using<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.170> 4k

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
here and what we're doing is using a 4k

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.330 
here and what we're doing is using a 4k
video<00:00:23.600> and<00:00:24.859> with<00:00:25.859> our<00:00:26.039> solution<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.170> this

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
video and with our solution on this

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.780 
video and with our solution on this
affinity<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.760> 6<00:00:30.119> set<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:31.070> 57<00:00:32.070> 60<00:00:32.550> by<00:00:33.450> 2160

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
affinity is 6 set up at 57 60 by 2160

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
affinity is 6 set up at 57 60 by 2160
it's<00:00:35.790> full<00:00:36.000> screen<00:00:36.620> explain<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.800> from

on<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:19.019> on<00:02:20.019> your<00:02:20.080> screen<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:20.620> was<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
on your on your screen there was a

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.070 
on your on your screen there was a
little<00:02:20.980> house<00:02:21.549> there<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:21.910> has<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.930> with

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
little house there and has to do with

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.430 
little house there and has to do with
the<00:02:23.849> with<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.970> video<00:02:25.239> yourself<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.170> think

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the with the video yourself is I think

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
the with the video yourself is I think
about<00:02:26.620> almost<00:02:27.160> 500<00:02:27.670> megabytes<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:29.530> size<00:02:29.590> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
about almost 500 megabytes in size you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.800 
about almost 500 megabytes in size you
can<00:02:31.780> actually<00:02:31.900> test<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.950> your

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
can actually test it out on your

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.050 
can actually test it out on your
computer<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.910> actually<00:02:38.760> plays<00:02:39.760> back

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
computer if if it actually plays back

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.569 
computer if if it actually plays back
out<00:02:40.269> smoothly
