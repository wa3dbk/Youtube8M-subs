is a poet in Reverse arrows this is
forward<00:00:46.500> look<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.300> I'm

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

running<00:00:48.660> backwards<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.830> just<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.190> way

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
running backwards it's just this way

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.680 
running backwards it's just this way
so<00:00:51.450> I'm<00:00:51.510> arrows<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.910> stop<00:00:54.270> it
