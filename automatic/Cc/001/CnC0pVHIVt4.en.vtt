in<00:01:21.360> series<00:01:22.049> 6<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> yep<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> torso<00:01:27.479> is

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
in series 6 I think so yep the torso is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.390 
in series 6 I think so yep the torso is
from<00:01:28.950> Indiana<00:01:29.430> Jones<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:31.040> finally<00:01:32.040> his<00:01:32.130> legs

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
from Indiana Jones and finally his legs

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
from Indiana Jones and finally his legs
or<00:01:32.700> dark<00:01:33.390> blue<00:01:33.689> legs<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> little

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
or dark blue legs to make the little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.640 
or dark blue legs to make the little
like<00:01:35.189> jeans

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
like jeans

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.690 
like jeans
so<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:37.799> Aiden<00:01:38.159> Pearce<00:01:39.530> next<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> Clara

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so that's Aiden Pearce next is Clara

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
so that's Aiden Pearce next is Clara
