but<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.319> he's<00:02:44.620> Slater's<00:02:45.159> not<00:02:45.340> used<00:02:45.579> to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
but I think he's Slater's not used to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.369 
but I think he's Slater's not used to
the<00:02:45.849> change<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.540> he<00:02:46.719> was<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.989> through

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
the change because he was going through

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.410 
the change because he was going through
three<00:02:48.099> main<00:02:48.310> band<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.909> the<00:02:48.939> middle<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.269> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
three main band in the middle of the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.959 
three main band in the middle of the
match<00:02:49.659> but<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.409> guess<00:02:50.500> he<00:02:50.680> had<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.099> little<00:02:51.730> bit<00:02:51.939> of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
match but I guess he had a little bit of

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.940 
match but I guess he had a little bit of
celebration<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.079> him<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:53.560> he<00:02:53.650> knew<00:02:53.799> he's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
celebration in him because he knew he's

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
celebration in him because he knew he's
going<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.189> win<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> match<00:02:54.730> that's<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:55.959> he

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
going to win the match that's right he

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.550

one star and that's probably still
