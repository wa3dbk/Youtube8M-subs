00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.290
 i and ii 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.890
 street races are already part of the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.400
 Brazilian life but over the years 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.400
 much has been looking for alternative evidence 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.739
 occurred on trails and mountains beaches 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.910
 but the great news is proof of the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.580
 desert 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.860
 the marathon and I returned from 23 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.530
 miles in the middle of the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.559
 atacama in chile considered the local 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.909
 world's driest in one of the corridors 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.170
 passing through the valley of death will give the 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.170
 sites are filled with 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 run in the middle of tunas trail you give 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 an innovative step in walking only halfway 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.400
 positive step the very dry desert air 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690
 of defense of bush in 2007 hooks 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.610
 completely new experience and this has 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.080
 It was very cool, it was very exciting to do. 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.780
 something different until the training was very 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.810
 different a lot of sand work a lot 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:29.790
 cool I actually practice forbidden rate 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:34.590
 on shorelines and many beaches trails 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 I would become a major blow to the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.789
 home I think that do ask that we 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 go 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.310
 I like the speed and the asphalt 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.940
 today and go all of life in that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 Speed is when we get to the beach. 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.430
 It's the owner's it's tiring but then I like it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.540
 very constant and it can become 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.119
 dedicated to a heat is more climbed its 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.420
 after your life 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.000
 loved the fellow if you where it comes from your 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.410
 wife here is also eye-catching people 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.550
 on the street our lady always the same 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.980
 people 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.890
 now you can for example the time is 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.730
 which takes to require more commitment 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480
 condemned 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.480
 sent 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.790
 You will see these people. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.630
 I think it's pure people do the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.040
 Caesar businessman in the camera 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.410
 I will definitely talk to the staff 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.260
 We have to think about the thigh for 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.860
 example 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.860
 it's the goal 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 it is certainly a tendency to do 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.460
 different tests 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.680
 is the race has grown a lot every time 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.880
 But we forget the new audience. 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.920
 challenges so easy 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.110
 was a 10 km run of the plane but 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 It's really lacking that if it can always be more 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.740
 deep because so much different 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:13.430
 so this personality 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:15.620
 still the country to meet others 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.260
 no more places in another type of person 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.630
 it is not only closed to him in that group 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.930
 I have the riders think it's more 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.930
 interesting
