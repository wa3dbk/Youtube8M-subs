00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.709
 Good Morning 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.370
 the pro will be 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.150
 there to cut an nc service 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.940
 good to start we have to verify that our connection I have 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.959
 unite 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.679
 in this case we do not kill 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.820
 to the support 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.739
 we will go and have 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.319
 an idea with figure of in this case we have to configure the 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.609
 unite manually we go to probity and 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 eamon double click here we have that 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.859
 dior are produced causing an address manually 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.010
 we have a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.040
 maitÃ© or useful 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.100
 the preferred bns that we're going to that ready to inherit the service on the set 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.590
 we were going to win 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.410
 to continue nacho service dns we go to start button 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 we are friends with your server 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.580
 here they do not go to bars in the functions 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.760
 who are we adding or removing on the server 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 we will add or remove 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.159
 We are going to vote a preliminary step which I love alessi 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 detecting any connection 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 we wait 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 here it will not appear still rejuvenated from a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.579
 a young woman 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.350
 a typical configuration for a main server or once analyzed 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.630
 in this case motor to the custom add 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.180
 well, for a hundred 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.920
 let's talk they thought Saturday 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.040
 to convert what one wants any service 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.560
 let's read 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.510
 aquino manara appears the different services love him 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 a server dns let's read next 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 let's read 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.270
 next it will not seem like a summary of selecting and to confirm it follow it 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.019
 service tide 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.389
 here it will not appear configuring in this case the celarg mark 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.299
 for us to make a more viable configuration says nothing easier 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.719
 here does not appear anyone can not be completed 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 since he the creators dns server 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.119
 but no 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.159
 has been configured for use 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
 use in this case I love all the programs 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.969
 administrative tool 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.969
 no month service will appear 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.340
 in this service we are going to start adding the larsson inverse zone 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.379
 we give you in action we can not give you 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.869
 in the tab 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.219
 Right click sounds again 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.219
 that mother to us are inverse 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.729
 let's create the main area 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.699
 here we are going to create 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.089
 the ip that we place in this case are 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.569
 accepts clover tebeto looting 1 91 68 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.609
 point 1 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.719
 let's read the following 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.909
 let's read a new file 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.149
 let's read let the current crisis 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.159
 expansion in dynamics 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.569
 in this case that would be the most recommended option for the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.729
 first does not appear when we already have an active directory 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.109
 nao finish 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.419
 we already have our are invex 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.789
 reverse we go to the direct one we give a new one equally 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.540
 we also give mason to main or central 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.609
 here we are going to put 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.739
 we are going to put him as another Dominican minor 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.319
 the name of the server in this case the suckers 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.149
 serene 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.639
 cyt 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.209
 point 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.949
 cartagena 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.049
 a mole 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.839
 let's see the following 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.150
 let's see also create a new file 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.329
 let's also read that he dedicates the update 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.719
 yao finalist 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.150
 and in this case 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.870
 we have our two zones 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.360
 but this area would lack new smoke 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.490
 in this case we will place the name of the team 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.879
 lahmad place the server 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 and ela and we fight to place a thousand the one that is using management gone one 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.889
 I felt next to 1 point 1 that we placed in the preferred dns 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.349
 let's read add games and there 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.360
 he has successfully created the death to the state 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.059
 we proceed 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.629
 then they added 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.240
 arias 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 in this case double triple 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.430
 let's read 100 men full domain for count destination 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.810
 and we arrived late the file that I think 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.810
 server 1 we refuse to accept 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.529
 here either that it also transcended platforms 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.319
 everything we go 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.159
 the symbol is and teba 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.089
 approve if it worked 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.589
 or if you have created our server the command in that place 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.129
 aena varese from the chain our shipments 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.919
 of bs server 1 dwarf points and point 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.800
 share pointed with 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 good here and we conclude our 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.469
 oltra 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.240
 in position 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.389
 the installation of the service
