stars<00:01:46.890> which<00:01:47.159> introduces<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> idea<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
stars which introduces the idea of a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.020 
stars which introduces the idea of a
target<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.770> stars<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.369> appear<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
target some stars will appear in a

Stars now we're introducing funny face
which<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.120> also<00:02:24.270> targeting<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.320> more

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
which is also targeting but with more

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:35.600 
which is also targeting but with more
places<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.510> touch<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:34.280> move<00:02:35.280> around<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
places to touch that move around the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:48.800 
places to touch that move around the
funny<00:02:35.820> face<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.620> happens<00:02:47.810> finally

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
funny face and see what happens finally

the<00:02:53.250> pointer<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:54.090> over<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> dolls<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:59.220> make

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the pointer on over the dolls to make

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.699 
the pointer on over the dolls to make
them<00:02:59.520> bark<00:02:59.760> rather<00:03:00.030> tunefully<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.570> think<00:03:00.810> but

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
them bark rather tunefully I think but

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.030 
them bark rather tunefully I think but
also<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.420> activity<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.440> introduce<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
also in this activity we introduce the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920 
also in this activity we introduce the
idea<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.430> toggling<00:03:05.880> something<00:03:06.269> on<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> off<00:03:06.660> if

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
idea of toggling something on and off if

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
idea of toggling something on and off if
you<00:03:07.590> move<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> pointer<00:03:08.190> over<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.489> ball<00:03:08.670> it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
you move the pointer over the ball it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.980 
you move the pointer over the ball it
will<00:03:09.209> start<00:03:09.540> some<00:03:09.780> music

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.650 

and<00:03:16.560> move<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.520> pointer<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:17.940> over<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.480> turn

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and move the pointer back over to turn

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300 
and move the pointer back over to turn
