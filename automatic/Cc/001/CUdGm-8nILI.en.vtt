bad it's just surface rust and you know
of<00:00:40.110> course<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> got<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.129> manifold

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of course you got the the manifold

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
of course you got the the manifold
that's<00:00:42.000> rusty<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.020> look<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that's rusty you look here at this that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
that's rusty you look here at this that
the<00:00:44.700> generator<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.620> rusts

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the generator that's a little rusts

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.850 
the generator that's a little rusts
little<00:00:47.460> rusty<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.840> valve<00:00:49.110> cover<00:00:49.530> needs

repainting<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.610> course<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> air

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
repainting of course I've got the air

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.709 
repainting of course I've got the air
cleaner<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> I'll<00:00:52.710> repaint<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
cleaner off now and I'll repaint that

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
cleaner off now and I'll repaint that
and<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.140> over<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and then you look over here at the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.119 
and then you look over here at the
heater<00:00:56.100> boxes<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.809> heater<00:00:58.129> core

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
heater boxes you can see the heater core

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
heater boxes you can see the heater core
here<00:00:59.550> could<00:01:00.180> use<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.719> touching<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.289> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
here could use a little touching up so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
here could use a little touching up so
I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.730> ahead<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.390> I'm

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I'm going to go ahead and do that I'm

manifolds and they'll give you this nice
flat<00:01:56.280> black<00:01:56.610> color<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.259> take<00:01:58.469> away

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
flat black color and they just take away

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
flat black color and they just take away
from<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> rust<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> looks<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.110> gonna

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
from the rust so it looks like I'm gonna

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
from the rust so it looks like I'm gonna
have<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> remove<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> valve<00:02:02.130> cover<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
have to remove the valve cover here and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.969 
have to remove the valve cover here and
clean<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.140> I'll<00:02:04.469> paint<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
clean this all up I'll paint this a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.370 
clean this all up I'll paint this a
satin<00:02:05.520> black<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.810> I'll<00:02:06.930> come<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.200> here

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
satin black and then I'll come in here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.660 
satin black and then I'll come in here
with<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:07.890> engine<00:02:08.220> block<00:02:08.629> flat<00:02:09.629> black<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
with some engine block flat black and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.280 
with some engine block flat black and
probably<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> brush<00:02:12.989> I'm

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
probably just do this with a brush I'm

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.730 
probably just do this with a brush I'm
not<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
not going to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
not going to
take<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> engine<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.150> apart<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
take the engine all the way apart to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.370 
take the engine all the way apart to
detail<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> final<00:02:17.400> comment<00:02:18.380> when

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
detail it and as a final comment when

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.430 
detail it and as a final comment when
working<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.370> miracle<00:02:21.240> paint<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.020> miracle

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
working with a miracle paint the miracle

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.480 
working with a miracle paint the miracle
paint<00:02:22.680> tends<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.250> dry<00:02:23.490> very<00:02:24.080> shiny<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.490> that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
paint tends to dry very shiny and that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.230 
paint tends to dry very shiny and that
becomes<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:27.930> obvious<00:02:29.240> flaw

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
becomes you know kind of an obvious flaw

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.060 
becomes you know kind of an obvious flaw
if<00:02:30.540> you're<00:02:30.720> trying<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.200> keep<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.470> car<00:02:31.770> looking

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
if you're trying to keep the car looking

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.250 
if you're trying to keep the car looking
original<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.210> one<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.600> things<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:33.960> do

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
original so one of the things I can do

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.070 
original so one of the things I can do
is<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.590> use<00:02:34.770> either<00:02:35.190> spray<00:02:35.700> flat<00:02:36.060> or<00:02:36.390> brush

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
is I can use either spray flat or brush

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.890 
is I can use either spray flat or brush
flat<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.770> come<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.820> coat<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.360> top<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.810> the

flat and come in and coat the top of the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 
flat and come in and coat the top of the
miracle<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> flat<00:02:40.860> black<00:02:41.400> paint<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> then

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
miracle with a flat black paint and then

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.240 
miracle with a flat black paint and then
you're<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.470> nice<00:02:43.920> shiny

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
