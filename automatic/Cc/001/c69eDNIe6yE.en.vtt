the<00:00:11.700> Burton<00:00:12.120> cartel<00:00:13.250> restricted<00:00:14.250> binding<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
the Burton cartel restricted binding and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.260 
the Burton cartel restricted binding and
I<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:17.100> looking<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> pair<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> bindings<00:00:18.119> for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I was looking for a pair of bindings for

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.150 
I was looking for a pair of bindings for
quite<00:00:18.510> some<00:00:18.750> time<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.529> finally<00:00:19.770> pulled<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
quite some time and I finally pulled the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240 
quite some time and I finally pulled the
trigger<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> went<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> cartels<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
trigger and went with the cartels so I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
trigger and went with the cartels so I
figured<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> would<00:00:24.000> make<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.390> video<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
figured I would make a little video to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.660 
figured I would make a little video to
show<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.439> guys<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.070> bindings<00:00:26.550> are

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
show you guys what these bindings are

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
show you guys what these bindings are
all<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.050> let's<00:00:28.320> take<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> look<00:00:30.080> alright

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
all about so let's take a look alright

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.260 
all about so let's take a look alright
so<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.130> these<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> Burton

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
so as you can see these are the Burton

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.209 
so as you can see these are the Burton
cartels<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> 2014<00:00:35.640> version<00:00:37.219> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
cartels and this is the 2014 version you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
cartels and this is the 2014 version you
can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> response<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
can see right there that the response is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
can see right there that the response is
a<00:00:40.860> seven<00:00:41.309> which<00:00:41.790> means<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.450> bindings

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
a seven which means that these bindings

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.229 
a seven which means that these bindings
are<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.290> bit<00:00:43.469> stiffer<00:00:43.800> than

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
are gonna be a little bit stiffer than

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
are gonna be a little bit stiffer than
some<00:00:45.239> other<00:00:45.390> bindings<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.710> main<00:00:46.860> reason

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
some other bindings and the main reason

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
some other bindings and the main reason
I<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.539> cartels<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.469> I'm<00:00:49.649> looking

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I got the cartels is because I'm looking

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.150 
I got the cartels is because I'm looking
to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:51.260> all-mountain<00:00:52.260> freestyle<00:00:52.890> type

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to do more all-mountain freestyle type

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
to do more all-mountain freestyle type
of<00:00:53.399> riding<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.940> basically<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> binding<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of riding so basically a binding that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.099 
of riding so basically a binding that
can<00:00:55.289> handle<00:00:55.590> anything<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> thought<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
can handle anything so I thought that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:12.740 
can handle anything so I thought that
these<00:00:58.260> fit<00:00:58.699> fit<00:00:59.719> my<00:01:00.719> skill<00:01:01.079> level<00:01:01.109> well<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:11.750> yes

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
these fit fit my skill level well so yes

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
these fit fit my skill level well so yes
we<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> nice<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.619> booklet<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.570> all

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
we got a nice little booklet there all

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.880 
we got a nice little booklet there all
kinds<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> information<00:01:17.840> will<00:01:18.840> come<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.170> handy

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.230 

now<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.579> also<00:01:24.729> comes<00:01:25.119> with<00:01:26.909> three<00:01:27.909> different

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
now it also comes with three different

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.169 
now it also comes with three different
types<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.630> disks<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.149> figure<00:01:31.359> it<00:01:31.539> out<00:01:36.179> okay

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
types of disks we can figure it out okay

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.389 
types of disks we can figure it out okay
so<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.659> board<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.960> have<00:01:38.170> it's<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.920> regular

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
so the board I have it's a regular

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.849 
so the board I have it's a regular
Burton<00:01:39.700> board<00:01:40.319> but<00:01:41.319> it<00:01:41.530> comes<00:01:42.130> with<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.459> 3d

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
Burton board but it comes with the 3d

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.609 
Burton board but it comes with the 3d
hole<00:01:44.859> pattern<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.579> so<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:47.200> would<00:01:47.319> use<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
hole pattern and so you would use this

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.309 
hole pattern and so you would use this
type<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:47.859> disk<00:01:48.130> for<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.869> also<00:01:50.020> comes<00:01:50.200> with

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
type of disk for that it also comes with

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.949 
type of disk for that it also comes with
the<00:01:50.500> 4x4<00:01:51.100> pattern<00:01:51.939> so<00:01:52.149> even<00:01:52.539> if<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.780> don't

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
the 4x4 pattern so even if you don't

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.620 
the 4x4 pattern so even if you don't
have<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.109> Burton<00:01:53.350> board<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:55.030> bindings<00:01:55.450> will

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
have a Burton board these bindings will

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
have a Burton board these bindings will
work<00:01:56.259> with<00:01:56.500> any<00:01:56.709> other<00:01:56.799> board<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.459> has<00:01:57.610> a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
work with any other board that has a

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.479 
work with any other board that has a
four<00:01:57.909> by<00:01:58.060> four<00:01:58.090> hole<00:01:58.750> pattern<00:01:59.099> and<00:02:00.099> also<00:02:00.959> I

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
four by four hole pattern and also I

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.559 
four by four hole pattern and also I
guess<00:02:03.489> you<00:02:03.579> would<00:02:03.700> typically<00:02:03.969> want<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.270> get<00:02:04.420> an

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
guess you would typically want to get an

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.770 
guess you would typically want to get an
est<00:02:04.989> binding<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.709> these<00:02:05.920> findings<00:02:06.640> would<00:02:06.939> I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
est binding but these findings would I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.830 
est binding but these findings would I
guess<00:02:08.739> also<00:02:08.920> be<00:02:09.250> compatible<00:02:10.030> with<00:02:10.360> an<00:02:10.539> est

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
guess also be compatible with an est

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.830 
guess also be compatible with an est
board<00:02:11.379> with<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> channel<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
board with the channel so that is the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.339 
board with the channel so that is the
base<00:02:14.019> plate<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.930> also<00:02:20.049> get

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
base plate for that then you also get

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.460 
base plate for that then you also get
you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.459> your<00:02:21.640> screws<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.470> various

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
you know your screws and various

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.120 
you know your screws and various
hardware<00:02:24.220> needed<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:26.560> check<00:02:26.799> out<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
hardware needed let's check out the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.949 
hardware needed let's check out the
actual<00:02:27.430> binding<00:02:27.850> itself<00:02:33.450> cool<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.690> when<00:02:34.870> we

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
actual binding itself cool so when we

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.309 
actual binding itself cool so when we
open<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> up

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.530

greenish and it's got these specks these

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.809 
greenish and it's got these specks these
specks<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.470> but<00:03:04.470> pretty<00:03:04.680> cool<00:03:04.980> design

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.880 

and<00:03:12.540> we'll<00:03:12.659> go<00:03:12.810> over<00:03:12.840> some<00:03:13.140> features<00:03:15.890> all

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
and we'll go over some features all

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.750 
and we'll go over some features all
right<00:03:17.159> so<00:03:17.370> let's<00:03:17.519> go<00:03:17.640> over<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.939> high-back<00:03:19.760> so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
right so let's go over the high-back so

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.240 
right so let's go over the high-back so
as<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.099> super<00:03:24.980> what<00:03:25.980> appears

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as you can see just a super what appears

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
as you can see just a super what appears
to<00:03:26.310> be<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.489> super<00:03:26.879> well<00:03:27.540> forming<00:03:27.989> high-back

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
to be a super well forming high-back

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.740 
to be a super well forming high-back
looks<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.849> formed<00:03:30.180> pretty<00:03:30.359> well<00:03:30.540> to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
looks like it all formed pretty well to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.740 
looks like it all formed pretty well to
your<00:03:30.870> boot<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:35.579> thought<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.390> was<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.569> neat

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
your boot and I thought this was a neat

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.309 
your boot and I thought this was a neat
feature

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
feature

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.649 
feature
I<00:03:37.349> guess<00:03:37.739> they<00:03:37.920> added<00:03:38.189> it<00:03:38.420> probably<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
I guess they added it probably for the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.839 
I guess they added it probably for the
past<00:03:39.840> couple<00:03:40.049> years<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.739> their<00:03:40.980> Burton

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
past couple years to their Burton

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.599 
past couple years to their Burton
bindings<00:03:41.969> I<00:03:42.829> was<00:03:43.829> called<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> dial<00:03:44.310> flat

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
bindings I was called the dial flat

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.420 
bindings I was called the dial flat
which<00:03:45.359> basically<00:03:45.659> means<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.129> you<00:03:47.129> can<00:03:47.250> see

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
which basically means that you can see

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.899 
which basically means that you can see
it<00:03:47.519> there

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
it there

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.750 
it there
I<00:03:47.939> got<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> plus<00:03:48.569> sign<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> minus<00:03:49.349> sign<00:03:49.760> so

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
I got a plus sign and a minus sign so

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.030 
I got a plus sign and a minus sign so
basically<00:03:52.220> if<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.370> crank<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:55.040> it'll

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
basically if you crank it up it'll

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.520 
basically if you crank it up it'll
change<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:58.340> forward<00:03:59.340> lean<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.909> high<00:04:00.090> back

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
change the forward lean on the high back

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.069 
change the forward lean on the high back
so<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:02.849> know<00:04:02.939> if<00:04:03.060> you're<00:04:03.239> if<00:04:03.689> you're<00:04:03.720> writing

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
so you know if you're if you're writing

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.599 
so you know if you're if you're writing
something<00:04:04.430> steeper<00:04:06.769> perhaps<00:04:07.769> doing<00:04:08.129> moguls

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
something steeper perhaps doing moguls

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.059 
something steeper perhaps doing moguls
or<00:04:08.790> something<00:04:09.150> or<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> halfpipe<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.590> you

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
or something or in the halfpipe and you

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.610 
or something or in the halfpipe and you
want<00:04:11.310> more<00:04:12.030> response<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.200> crank<00:04:13.409> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
want more response you can crank it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.000 
want more response you can crank it
forward<00:04:14.269> using<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.389> dial<00:04:15.629> now<00:04:16.530> give<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.829> more

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
forward using the dial now give you more

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.770 
forward using the dial now give you more
response<00:04:17.370> or<00:04:17.669> if<00:04:17.970> you're<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.299> park<00:04:18.510> you

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
response or if you're in the park you

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.719 
response or if you're in the park you
know<00:04:18.840> you're<00:04:19.169> jibing<00:04:19.500> around<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.549> want

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
know you're jibing around you want

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.550 
know you're jibing around you want
something<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.120> more<00:04:21.449> relaxed<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.530> can

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
something a little more relaxed you can

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.110 
something a little more relaxed you can
just<00:04:22.889> put<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.699> straight<00:04:23.820> back<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:27.030> a

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
just put it straight back so that it's a

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.340 
just put it straight back so that it's a
more<00:04:27.330> relaxed<00:04:27.810> fuel

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.490 

all<00:04:36.350> right<00:04:36.560> let's<00:04:36.890> check<00:04:36.980> out<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.670> straps<00:04:38.500> so

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
all right let's check out the straps so

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200 
all right let's check out the straps so
this<00:04:39.800> binding<00:04:40.160> being<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.670> restricted

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
this binding being the restricted

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.930 
this binding being the restricted
version<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.950> means<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.460> comes<00:04:43.640> with<00:04:43.730> the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
version it means that it comes with the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.780 
version it means that it comes with the
ACM<00:04:44.450> react<00:04:44.720> strap<00:04:45.100> which<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.430> little

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
ACM react strap which is a little

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.630 
ACM react strap which is a little
different<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.270> strap<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.130> they<00:04:49.430> say<00:04:49.580> on

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
different of a strap and they say on

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.160 
different of a strap and they say on
their<00:04:49.730> website<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.360> can<00:04:50.510> choose

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
their website that you can choose

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.760 
their website that you can choose
between<00:04:51.380> power<00:04:51.800> or<00:04:52.070> mobility<00:04:52.430> in<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.330> shape

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
between power or mobility in the shape

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
between power or mobility in the shape
so<00:04:54.770> I'll<00:04:54.890> have<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.130> mess<00:04:55.280> around<00:04:55.400> with<00:04:55.580> that

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
so I'll have to mess around with that

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.100 
so I'll have to mess around with that
and<00:04:56.060> see<00:04:56.120> how<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.450> goes

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and see how that goes

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.940 
and see how that goes
it<00:04:57.890> just<00:04:58.070> feels<00:04:58.220> like<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:59.270> know<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.390> super

also thought I'd just show you guys the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.660 
also thought I'd just show you guys the
underside<00:06:43.540> of<00:06:43.570> the<00:06:43.750> binding<00:06:44.190> so<00:06:45.190> as<00:06:45.430> you<00:06:45.580> can

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
underside of the binding so as you can

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.910 
underside of the binding so as you can
see<00:06:45.730> here<00:06:46.120> the<00:06:46.270> only<00:06:46.540> place<00:06:46.840> that<00:06:47.140> the<00:06:47.500> binding

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
see here the only place that the binding

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.830 
see here the only place that the binding
attaches<00:06:48.400> to<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:48.670> board<00:06:48.910> is<00:06:49.360> right<00:06:49.570> here<00:06:49.750> in

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
attaches to the board is right here in

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.000 
attaches to the board is right here in
the<00:06:49.930> middle<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:51.430> so<00:06:52.060> this<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:52.630> this<00:06:53.050> is<00:06:53.320> just

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
the middle and so this and this is just

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.770 
the middle and so this and this is just
all<00:06:54.250> cushioning<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:57.100> it<00:06:57.970> appears<00:06:58.360> that<00:06:58.600> you

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
all cushioning so it appears that you

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.730 
all cushioning so it appears that you
just<00:06:58.930> have<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.140> lot<00:06:59.380> more<00:07:01.020> flex<00:07:02.020> with<00:07:02.320> the<00:07:02.350> board

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
just have a lot more flex with the board

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.300 
just have a lot more flex with the board
and<00:07:03.520> it<00:07:03.730> just<00:07:03.940> feels<00:07:04.510> more<00:07:04.810> natural<00:07:05.130> almost<00:07:06.130> as

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
and it just feels more natural almost as

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.590 
and it just feels more natural almost as
if<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.580> binding<00:07:06.790> isn't<00:07:07.180> there<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.390> would

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
if the binding isn't there I would

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:24.150 
if the binding isn't there I would
imagine<00:07:09.030> so<00:07:10.030> just<00:07:10.240> very<00:07:10.570> cool<00:07:23.010> you<00:07:24.010> know<00:07:24.130> it's

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
imagine so just very cool you know it's

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.920 
imagine so just very cool you know it's
a<00:07:24.460> little<00:07:24.610> bit<00:07:24.790> more<00:07:24.940> pricey<00:07:25.240> but<00:07:25.780> I<00:07:25.870> do

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
a little bit more pricey but I do

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.530 
a little bit more pricey but I do
believe<00:07:26.380> that<00:07:26.700> what<00:07:27.700> you<00:07:27.820> pay<00:07:28.000> for<00:07:28.030> is<00:07:28.360> what
