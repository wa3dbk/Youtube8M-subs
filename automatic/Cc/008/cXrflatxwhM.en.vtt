00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
opinion by impact is the most fun way to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.229 
opinion by impact is the most fun way to
play<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> team<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.489> but<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
play out on the team and but also the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.630 
play out on the team and but also the
most<00:01:00.539> waste<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.530> money<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.430> could

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
most waste of money that you could

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
most waste of money that you could
possibly<00:01:02.850> imagine<00:01:03.090> particularly<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.229> gold

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
possibly imagine particularly with gold

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
possibly imagine particularly with gold
packs<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.850> hard<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.450> profit<00:01:06.689> if

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
packs it's very hard to make a profit if

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
packs it's very hard to make a profit if
you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> decent<00:01:07.710> player<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.909> make

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you don't get a decent player to make

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
you don't get a decent player to make
you<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> return<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.229> still<00:01:10.409> packs<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> less

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you that return we still packs is less

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
you that return we still packs is less
so<00:01:11.340> he<00:01:11.490> only<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> sell<00:01:12.119> each<00:01:12.240> card<00:01:12.570> for

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so he only have to sell each card for

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.700 
so he only have to sell each card for
250<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> make<00:01:14.070> 500<00:01:14.670> Queens<00:01:15.350> sounds<00:01:16.350> easier

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.420 
to the search bar for it and I'll have a
look<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:34.860> they're<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
look to see what they're going for a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
look to see what they're going for a
leverage<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.990> I'll<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.860> put

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
leverage at that time and I'll then put

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.260 
leverage at that time and I'll then put
them<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.329> usually<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.979> contracts<00:01:40.979> up

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
them up and I usually put contracts up

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
for I think it is start price 1500 by

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.940 
for I think it is start price 1500 by
now<00:02:37.610> 2500<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:40.170> does<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.380> well<00:02:40.770> which
