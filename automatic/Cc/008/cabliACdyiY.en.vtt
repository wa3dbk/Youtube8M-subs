and<00:01:43.980> he'd<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.430> loved

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.270 

go<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.560> fingering<00:01:50.010> I<00:01:50.900> prefer<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:53.070> should

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
go for fingering I prefer you should

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.830 
go for fingering I prefer you should
probably<00:01:53.490> learn<00:01:53.880> doing<00:01:54.480> one

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
probably learn doing one

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.450 
probably learn doing one
five<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.880> like<00:01:59.119> yoga<00:01:59.840> but<00:02:00.740> when<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.009> do<00:02:01.189> this

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
five just like yoga but when you do this

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.050 
five just like yoga but when you do this
first<00:02:01.790> inversion

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
first inversion

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.870 
first inversion
I<00:02:04.090> like<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.230> use<00:02:05.350> one<00:02:05.680> two<00:02:05.950> three<00:02:06.280> five<00:02:06.460> all<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
I like to use one two three five all the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.719 
I like to use one two three five all the
time<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.100> one<00:02:09.100> two<00:02:09.340> four

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
time but I think you can one two four

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.410 
time but I think you can one two four
five

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
five

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.970 
five
leaving<00:02:10.990> your<00:02:11.080> fourth<00:02:11.350> favorite<00:02:11.770> that's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
leaving your fourth favorite that's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.100 
leaving your fourth favorite that's
instead<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.490> your<00:02:12.640> third<00:02:12.910> might<00:02:13.600> work<00:02:13.840> better

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
instead of your third might work better

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.830 
instead of your third might work better
for<00:02:14.380> you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
for you

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.420 
for you
so<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.440> try<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.950> though<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.400> that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
so you can try that if though if that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.470 
so you can try that if though if that
works<00:02:17.760> better<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.530> same<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:23.480> don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
works better for you same here I don't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480 
works better for you same here I don't
think<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:24.930> matters<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.770> do<00:02:26.190> what<00:02:26.340> feels

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
think it really matters so do what feels

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:37.280 
think it really matters so do what feels
right<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> another<00:02:30.180> example<00:02:30.800> D<00:02:31.800> major<00:02:36.290> back

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
right so another example D major back

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
right so another example D major back
down<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.830> D<00:02:38.760> F<00:02:39.120> sharp<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
down a D F sharp a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.589 
down a D F sharp a
[Music]

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
[Music]

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.540 
[Music]
and<00:02:46.439> then

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.810 

so<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.360> might<00:02:50.540> help<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.680> about<00:02:53.020> my

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
so it might help if you think about my

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.770 
so it might help if you think about my
pretend<00:02:55.820> these<00:02:56.260> three<00:02:57.260> type<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:58.010> notes<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.490> C<00:02:58.880> D

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
pretend these three type of notes is C D

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.730 
pretend these three type of notes is C D
and<00:03:00.140> G<00:03:00.410> pretend<00:03:01.370> they're<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.390> colored<00:03:02.900> so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
and G pretend they're like colored so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.940 
and G pretend they're like colored so
even<00:03:04.220> only<00:03:04.400> play<00:03:04.700> these<00:03:04.880> colored<00:03:05.330> notes<00:03:05.950> so

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
even only play these colored notes so

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.800 
even only play these colored notes so
what's<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.430> next<00:03:07.580> combination<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.660> notes

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
what's the next combination of notes

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.540 
what's the next combination of notes
that<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.170> can<00:03:09.320> play

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
that you can play

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.710 
that you can play
it<00:03:11.030> would<00:03:11.210> be

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720
