00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Y 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.100
 in your bank we show you how to install 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.920
 valves and siphon sink 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.440
 kitchen you will need a screwdriver one 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.140
 tape measure a marker a tube 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.960
 pvc of 40 a saw arch and a 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.939
 sergeant this sink two breasts by 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.189
 both have two drain valves and one 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.900
 overflow we start riding the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.369
 overflow if you notice the piece well 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.919
 rectangular rubber that is screwed to 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.199
 the grid has shape places the part 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.789
 thicker in the lower area so that 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.430
 is better suited to the sinus curve of the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.960
 sink a few drops of oil te 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.230
 will facilitate the assembly of the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.230
 overflow 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 we introduce the overflow below 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.730
 of the sink and screw it into the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.730
 grating 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 the tube co as it drops towards the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.480
 valve has a conical tip and a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.400
 thread for your union places the board 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.760
 conical with the thinnest part towards the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760
 valve 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 locate the valve that has 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.320
 entrance to the overflow place the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.210
 cup and the board below the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.479
 sink and connect the tube to the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.479
 overflow 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.220
 then place by the part of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.880
 up the grate with its rubber tip 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.880
 correspondent 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.149
 tighten the central screw to leave 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.009
 fix the valve in its position to 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.780
 finish introducing the grid plug 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.860
 which is very useful to prevent the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 solid waste passage 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.050
 proceeds in exactly the same way 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.050
 to fix the valve in the second sine 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.660
 the sink comes drilled for the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.220
 faucet in its central part but brings a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.020
 stainless steel stopper to hide 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.520
 the hole in the event that the risk 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.760
 go installed on the wall or in the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.760
 worktop 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.060
 as two breasts delivery we're going to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.310
 install a set that consists of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 two and juanes layered one per valve 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 drain that join in a third the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.020
 which connects to the drain pipe 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.020
 which is on the wall 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.230
 watch the images as they go 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.099
 scratching some pieces with others 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.360
 interposing calm joints 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.360
 corresponding in each union 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.080
 when the pumps are thinner by a 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.550
 side that on the other the fine part is the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.210
 that is introduced inside the tube 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.210
 larger diameter 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.400
 are together that also allow you to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.710
 Slide the tube creating an effect 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.950
 telescopic to expand or reduce 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.950
 distances 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.790
 the upper output of the central is 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.569
 planned to connect the drain to 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.790
 recorder or dishwasher 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.390
 if you do not need it you have a stopper 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.390
 to close it 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.160
 once assembled the set you can already 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.200
 connect it to the valves as you can 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640
 see the siphons that leave some margin 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.510
 of rotation to better adjust to the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.510
 position of the valves 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.570
 now let's prepare the connection with 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.910
 the drain pipe that is in the 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.070
 wall for it we connect to the set 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.480
 a vertical outlet tube and an elbow 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.480
 where we will introduce the horizontal tube 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.610
 As you can see the siphons are 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.540
 telescopic and allow us to adjust the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.540
 height of the set 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.070
 we take the measure of the tube that 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.450
 we need considering that it has 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.130
 to enter both the tube that comes 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.610
 of the sink as in the pipeline that 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.610
 it's on the wall 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.469
 we cut it with a saw bow 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.090
 we put the boards and red 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.090
 corresponding and we connect it
