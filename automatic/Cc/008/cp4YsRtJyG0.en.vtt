00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:07.109
 Here comes the flagship of Leon 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.210
 drove in front of the leon cupra has 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.809
 a neat notebook with on the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.070
 get away 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.200
 he should not only inspire visually 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.780
 but the customers with sports cars 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 similar mileage and 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 long-distance comfort so convincing the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 neon the spanish lion is supposed to be 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.170
 give it as a gentle kitten, so to speak 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.300
 visually is very in the top model 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.770
 remained true to the design of the current leon 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.660
 Everything else would be complete 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.489
 incomprehensible because the optical 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 is one of the customers 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 main reasons for purchase clear 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 the top model differs in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 some details on the front and rear of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.589
 his tamer brothers, however, without 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.719
 to be intrusive 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.629
 the strongest seat series is now available 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.640
 for the first time in two body styles 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.210
 roots even five door model known for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.949
 other than three-door sc 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 but this spanish compact athlete 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 can do more than just watch 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.120
 his 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.730
 his true strengths are more technical 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.739
 nature 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.330
 on the one hand it is of course the engine of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.540
 for the impressive entrance 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.800
 responsible is optional 265 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.790
 or 280 ps for choice 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.470
 The engineers have achieved that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.220
 distinguished only by a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.410
 changed engine software to another is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.340
 it was the landing gear 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.710
 Technology enthusiasts for a satisfied 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.050
 smile is worried will leon cupra has one 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.850
 real active chassis on board the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.280
 different modes are not 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.200
 only a selection of given spring 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090
 damper tuning respective 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.759
 color profiles change the character of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.280
 cupra palpable thus manages the balancing act 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.270
 from fatigue 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.399
 long distance capability and highest 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.430
 performant companions on the 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.050
 race track and only there can he 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 his true potential under proof 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.440
 put the esp can indeed be complete 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.970
 switch off 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.679
 but that is also hunting 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.259
 fast lap times not at all 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.030
 necessary the vote fits optimally so 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.490
 that the compact athlete himself am 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.890
 limit not squeezed or from 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.520
 too timid technique patronized 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.550
 add 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 the extremely stable brakes show 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.959
 even after some courageous rounds 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.540
 border area no fading pressure point 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.730
 is probably dosed that from late but 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.099
 well controlled a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.690
 thanks to the standard cross-lock lets 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.670
 the cupra gets out of the bend early 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.129
 Accelerate the dreaded 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.909
 understeer that at 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.980
 Differential locks often occurs 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.959
 is missing entirely on the contrary 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.760
 even under full throttle the given 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.590
 Steering wheel as if he were on the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.690
 proverbial rails on the way 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.489
 this impressive traction can be 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.299
 maybe with a number clarified 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.709
 no matter with which engine or 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.750
 Body variant is in just under six 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.560
 seconds from the tempo 100 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.409
 to reach 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.700
 much less with a front-wheel drive 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.069
 physically impossible to realize 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440
 this sports car for everyday life 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.690
 was still priced in appropriately 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.859
 New ones are also helping in this segment 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.450
 Buyers find 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.459
 the prices start at 30 1810 euro 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.950
 Equipment is unusually extreme 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.930
 extensively the extra price list quite short 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.370
 at the beginning of march he stands at the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.370
 dealers for trial rides
