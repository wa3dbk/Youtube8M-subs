00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.440 
television only 10 inches but it is
extremely<00:01:43.259> thin<00:01:43.710> brilliant<00:01:44.549> color<00:01:44.790> mm-hmm

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
extremely thin brilliant color mm-hmm

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
extremely thin brilliant color mm-hmm
and<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.650> looks<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.430> nice

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and just just looks really really nice

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.800 
and just just looks really really nice
no<00:01:47.939> LED<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> organic<00:01:49.729> LED<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:51.090> yeah<00:01:51.329> organic

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
no LED is organic LED right yeah organic

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
no LED is organic LED right yeah organic
LED<00:01:52.140> yes<00:01:52.380> exactly<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.240> new

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
LED yes exactly and so it's a new

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
LED yes exactly and so it's a new
technology<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.860> provides<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> lot<00:01:56.670> more

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
technology that it provides a lot more

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.260 
technology that it provides a lot more
color<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.189> lot<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> people<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.119> saying

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
color and is a lot of people are saying

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.960 
color and is a lot of people are saying
might<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.659> take<00:02:01.079> over<00:02:01.350> over<00:02:01.770> LCD<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
might be take over over LCD you know in

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.100 
might be take over over LCD you know in
the<00:02:03.030> future<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.540> mean<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.780> were<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.020> many

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the future I mean there were so many

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.359 
the future I mean there were so many
different<00:02:04.350> science<00:02:04.710> fair<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:05.009> projects

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
different science fair like projects

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.130 
different science fair like projects
they<00:02:05.460> were<00:02:05.549> showing<00:02:05.790> bracelets<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.420> had<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
they were showing bracelets that had the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
they were showing bracelets that had the
rack<00:02:07.350> screens<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.279> them<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.119> wackiest

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
rack screens on them the wackiest

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
rack screens on them the wackiest
playing<00:02:09.959> wackiest<00:02:10.319> application<00:02:10.889> of<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
playing wackiest application of the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
playing wackiest application of the
screen<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.790> wackiest<00:02:12.359> application<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
screen the wackiest application of a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.880 
screen the wackiest application of a
screen<00:02:13.260> yeah<00:02:13.499> I<00:02:13.529> think

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
screen yeah I think

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
screen yeah I think
probably<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> wackiest<00:02:14.819> screen<00:02:15.210> i<00:02:15.360> saw<00:02:15.660> was

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
probably the wackiest screen i saw was

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
probably the wackiest screen i saw was
one<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.740> bracelet<00:02:17.160> but

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
one that was kind of like a bracelet but

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.550 
one that was kind of like a bracelet but
it<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.209> almost<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.569> paper<00:02:18.810> thin<00:02:18.990> kind<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it was almost like paper thin kind of a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.260 
it was almost like paper thin kind of a
thing<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.950> watch<00:02:20.220> TV<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> keep

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
thing you watch TV but you have to keep

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.120 
thing you watch TV but you have to keep
on<00:02:21.420> moving<00:02:21.780> your<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:22.260> hand<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.830> read<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
on moving your your hand to read the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
on moving your your hand to read the
chrome<00:02:23.340> yeah<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.360> kind<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.630> cool<00:02:24.690> but

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
chrome yeah so that was kind of cool but

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.180 
chrome yeah so that was kind of cool but
it<00:02:24.990> wasn't<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.410> wasn't<00:02:25.709> fully<00:02:25.860> fleshed

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it wasn't you know wasn't fully fleshed

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.470 
it wasn't you know wasn't fully fleshed
out<00:02:26.340> again<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.819> lot<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.150> science

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
out again like a lot of these science

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
out again like a lot of these science
fair<00:02:27.930> type<00:02:28.200> projects<00:02:29.100> right<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.180> your

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
fair type projects right right just your

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.540 
fair type projects right right just your
based<00:02:30.510> computing<00:02:30.990> motion<00:02:31.380> based<00:02:31.560> stuff<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
based computing motion based stuff that

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.270 
based computing motion based stuff that
was<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> big<00:02:33.240> thing<00:02:33.290> yeah<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.440> saw<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> couple<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
was a big thing yeah we saw a couple of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.790 
was a big thing yeah we saw a couple of
interesting<00:02:36.230> interfaces<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> will<00:02:37.620> are

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
interesting interfaces if you will are

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.920 
interesting interfaces if you will are
ways<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.340> kind<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> control<00:02:39.209> computers<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
ways to kind of control computers and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.750 
ways to kind of control computers and
other<00:02:40.020> devices<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.709> were<00:02:40.830> totally<00:02:41.250> based<00:02:41.459> on

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
other devices that were totally based on

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
other devices that were totally based on
how<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.390> move<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.870> hands<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.319> things<00:02:43.470> like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
how you move your hands and things like

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.500 
how you move your hands and things like
that<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.580> you'll<00:02:45.090> never<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.450> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that so you know you'll never have to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.550 
that so you know you'll never have to
worry<00:02:45.750> about<00:02:45.870> losing<00:02:46.080> your<00:02:46.290> remote<00:02:46.530> control

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
worry about losing your remote control

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.229 
worry about losing your remote control
again<00:02:47.070> because<00:02:47.400> everything<00:02:47.790> will<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.030> based

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
again because everything will be based

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.420 
again because everything will be based
on<00:02:48.390> gestures<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.050> make<00:02:49.230> toshiba<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:50.040> showing

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
on gestures you make toshiba was showing

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.270 
on gestures you make toshiba was showing
some<00:02:50.760> interesting<00:02:51.270> gesture-based

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
some interesting gesture-based

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.350 
some interesting gesture-based
interfaces<00:02:53.280> thanks<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> new<00:02:53.940> chip<00:02:54.209> they

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
interfaces thanks to a new chip they

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.300 
interfaces thanks to a new chip they
have<00:02:54.510> called<00:02:54.780> Spurs<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.620> Spurs<00:02:55.830> engine<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
have called Spurs the Spurs engine is a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.680 
have called Spurs the Spurs engine is a
new<00:02:56.400> processor<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.150> about<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> Spurs

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
new processor they have about the Spurs

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.180 
new processor they have about the Spurs
engine<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.290> gestures<00:02:58.680> are<00:02:58.860> these<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
engine what kind of gestures are these I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.479 
engine what kind of gestures are these I
mean<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.450> get<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:00.540> image<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.010> minority<00:03:02.010> report

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
mean I get an image of minority report

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.270 
mean I get an image of minority report
right<00:03:02.940> well<00:03:03.450> I'm<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:05.070> still

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
like you have to stand in front of the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.870 
like you have to stand in front of the
computer<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.890> very<00:03:08.130> specific<00:03:08.519> gestures

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
computer and do very specific gestures

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.699 
computer and do very specific gestures
like<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.300> know<00:03:09.390> thumbs<00:03:09.660> up<00:03:09.840> means<00:03:09.989> yes<00:03:10.440> okay

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
like you know thumbs up means yes okay

like you know thumbs up means yes okay
you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.160> thumb<00:03:11.370> soundings<00:03:11.730> know<00:03:11.910> there's

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you know thumb soundings know there's

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.120 
you know thumb soundings know there's
only<00:03:12.360> thing<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> Thurman<00:03:13.230> no<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.709> yet<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.950> mean

only thing a Thurman no not yet I mean

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.990 
only thing a Thurman no not yet I mean
it's<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> kind<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.610> thing<00:03:14.670> where<00:03:14.880> it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
saw pioneer also had kind of an

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.340 
saw pioneer also had kind of an
interesting<00:03:26.480> interface<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> car<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.320> a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
interesting interface for the car like a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
interesting interface for the car like a
control<00:03:28.769> system<00:03:28.980> kind<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> GPS<00:03:29.790> thing<00:03:29.970> that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
control system kind of a GPS thing that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.420 
control system kind of a GPS thing that
had<00:03:30.480> some<00:03:30.660> kind<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.870> motion<00:03:31.079> based<00:03:31.430> elements

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
had some kind of motion based elements

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.740 
had some kind of motion based elements
but<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.850> thought<00:03:33.180> they<00:03:33.360> were<00:03:33.420> kind<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
but I thought they were kind of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.449 
but I thought they were kind of
superfluous<00:03:34.230> ultimately<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.070> wasn't<00:03:35.250> that

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
superfluous ultimately and I wasn't that

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.890 
superfluous ultimately and I wasn't that
interested<00:03:35.850> in<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.060> one<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.480> goes<00:03:36.720> to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
interested in that one but it goes to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.210 
interested in that one but it goes to
show<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.290> we're<00:03:37.769> trying<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.100> get

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
show you that we're trying to get

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.420 
show you that we're trying to get
gesture<00:03:38.579> based<00:03:39.049> controls<00:03:40.049> into<00:03:40.920> all<00:03:41.070> kinds<00:03:41.400> of
