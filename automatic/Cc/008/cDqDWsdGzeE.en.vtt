talent we were able to build a game that
would<00:00:36.120> work<00:00:36.270> well<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.690> mobile<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
would work well on mobile and that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
would work well on mobile and that
appeal<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.899> dollars

of feedback we received it was
overwhelming<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> our<00:00:56.879> fans<00:00:57.680> constantly

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
overwhelming and our fans constantly

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
overwhelming and our fans constantly
asked<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.699> content<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.719> there

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
things that we wanted to have in the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
things that we wanted to have in the
first<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.990> didn't<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> time

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
first game but just didn't have the time

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
first game but just didn't have the time
or<00:01:07.740> money<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.150> actual<00:01:09.750> depth<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
or money there is an actual depth to the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
or money there is an actual depth to the
scene<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.340> adds<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:12.000> whole<00:01:12.270> new

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
scene and that actually adds a whole new

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
scene and that actually adds a whole new
element<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.900> gameplay<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> game

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
element of gameplay to the game

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
element of gameplay to the game
it<00:01:14.460> changes<00:01:14.970> strategies<00:01:15.450> dramatically<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it changes strategies dramatically and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
it changes strategies dramatically and
it<00:01:16.890> creates<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> whole<00:01:17.280> new<00:01:17.490> way<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> looking<00:01:17.970> at

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it creates a whole new way of looking at

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.780 
it creates a whole new way of looking at
maze<00:01:18.750> building<00:01:19.020> most<00:01:20.009> people<00:01:20.400> look<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.640> our

maze building most people look at our

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
maze building most people look at our
game<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.110> 2-d<00:01:22.680> game<00:01:22.710> in

acquired a lot of features that were

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
acquired a lot of features that were
first<00:01:48.540> plugins<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.380> biped<00:01:50.390> cat<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.780> then

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
first plugins like biped cat and then

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.190 
first plugins like biped cat and then
integrated<00:01:53.250> them<00:01:53.399> seamlessly<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:54.750> were<00:01:54.869> able

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
integrated them seamlessly we were able

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.859 
integrated them seamlessly we were able
to<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.470> biped<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.310> anim<00:01:56.670> almost<00:01:57.210> every<00:01:57.600> single

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
to use biped to anim almost every single

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.540 
to use biped to anim almost every single
character<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:59.040> in

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
character that we have in

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.600 
character that we have in
right<00:01:59.820> now<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.870> ability<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.350> simply<00:02:02.040> reuse

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
right now the ability to simply reuse

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.400 
right now the ability to simply reuse
some<00:02:02.910> of<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.030> animations<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.870> add<00:02:04.080> layers

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
some of the animations and add layers

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.230 
some of the animations and add layers
and<00:02:04.920> tweak<00:02:05.160> them<00:02:05.370> a<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.730> bit<00:02:05.910> add<00:02:06.210> a

very limited budget I think what a lot
of<00:02:53.310> people<00:02:53.610> underestimate<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.890> amount<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
of people underestimate is the amount of

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.790 
of people underestimate is the amount of
time<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.820> money<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.780> saves<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.500> actually

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
time and money that it saves to actually

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.370 
time and money that it saves to actually
use<00:02:58.980> 3ds<00:02:59.370> max<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.240> very<00:03:00.600> quickly<00:03:00.840> pays<00:03:01.170> for
