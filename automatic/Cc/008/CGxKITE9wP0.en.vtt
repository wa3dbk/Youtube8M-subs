00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.250
 by me and checked this time we're going to 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.750

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.250

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.769
 methods is fine I'll bring you the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.810
 third method that I use also for 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.720
 capture pokemon to china and more result 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.270
 more the most effective for me in my opinion 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.400
 or for my taste that I ask is the most 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.150
 effective than I thought me and good 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.360
 As it is called, this form is called 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.980
 safari friendship as we know in safari 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.260
 friendship is an area where we can 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.270
 capture pokemons in the development by 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.270
 half of our friends and good that 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.850
 we need to do this this method 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.710
 first we need to spend our game 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.649
 for the safari friendship then this one have 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.079
 then we need to have the city bad and 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.949
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.930
 we need adequate pokemones time and 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.670
 little valls we need a little bit 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 It's worth remembering that on this safari 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.580
 they do not give us a little raft 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.260
 and have enough friends added to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.770

 a lot of possibility of china and it's 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 too easy to find pokemon 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:13.319
 too simple four have already come out 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.319
