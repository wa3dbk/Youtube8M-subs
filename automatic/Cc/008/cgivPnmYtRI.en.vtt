 Anapa interface is analogous 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.800
 car Albanians did not 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.460
 so Iâ€™ll actually have to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.809
 to repeat 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.499
 the difference between these two models 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.269
 is only 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 in technical specifications 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
 our only here 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.480
 on it are located 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.770

 rubber plug and 3 5 input for 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.540
 connecting external audio devices

 display 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740
 for the sake here possesses 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980
 three such ranges and one 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.610
 time range 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.220
 for each of the range you can 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.700
 record up to 6 radio stations 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.160
 they will switch buttons 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 presets 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.710
 search for radio stations 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730
 you can exercise club points 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.040
 zero rights in step mode so 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 and in scan mode 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.810
 holding the button drives 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.390
 in this mode, the car radio will 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 memorize and radio stations which 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 possess the most powerful signal 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 the work of the player on the example of a flash drive 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.730
 arrows left and right 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 switch between tracks 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 retention is activated by holding them 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.510
 glomerulus to the south 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.130
 cancel the information which will 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130
 appear on the display 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 I want to note that both car stereo 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.119
 reads the Russian text 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.709
 file name 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.529
 however per annum 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 Russian text is not supported 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.979
 up and down arrows 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.309
 allows you to switch between 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.309
 with sticks 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.999
 cereals to 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.899
 solution leads unian 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.779
 resume either lay down 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.639
 play 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.669
 there is here 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.719
 opportunity 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.679
 random play 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.169
 opportunity 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.169
 on the repetition mode 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.149
 Turkey which 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.819
 loses prequel fast pore mode 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.819
 few seconds 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.259
 consider what 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 allows you to do 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.569
 you can set the value for low 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.709
 frequencies changing it 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.709
 minus 12 and up to 12 m 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.289
 high frequency value 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.489
 about the same range 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.010
 on islands distribution between 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.010
 left and right speakers 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.879
 distribution between 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 front and rear speakers 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.359
 so there is an opportunity 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.319
 switch between submitted 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.219
 by providers 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.959
 I want to note that playback 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.859
 list is similar to playback from 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.499
 flash drives 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.559
 and on the back is 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.319
 and by force of safety 15 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.799
 interior 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.510
 cable connector 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.379
 power supply 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.679
 two line outputs 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.679
 and I did not connect 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.669
 bundled supplied 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.669
 and we have four 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.400
