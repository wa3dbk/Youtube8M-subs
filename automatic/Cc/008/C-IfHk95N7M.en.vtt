00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.430 

yeah<00:02:03.790> I'm<00:02:04.120> really<00:02:04.420> excited<00:02:04.720> about<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.080> I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
yeah I'm really excited about this I

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.140 
yeah I'm really excited about this I
can't<00:02:05.650> wait<00:02:05.800> for<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.610> guess<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.000> is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
can't wait for the so I guess this is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.080 
can't wait for the so I guess this is
like<00:02:07.300> dark<00:02:07.659> rush<00:02:07.900> because<00:02:08.250> ricooo<00:02:09.250> VX<00:02:09.610> was<00:02:09.910> in

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
like dark rush because ricooo VX was in

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.600 
like dark rush because ricooo VX was in
dark<00:02:10.630> Russian<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.770> tornadoes<00:02:12.310> which<00:02:12.490> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
dark Russian so it was tornadoes which I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.100 
dark Russian so it was tornadoes which I
both<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:14.160> Japanese<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.780> show

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
both have in Japanese here so I can show

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
both have in Japanese here so I can show
you<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:20.560> probably<00:02:20.830> will<00:02:21.100> look<00:02:21.280> like

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you what they probably will look like

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.590 
you what they probably will look like
there's<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.520> tornadoes<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.450> just

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
there's the tornadoes and so just

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.350 
there's the tornadoes and so just
imagine<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:29.230> these<00:02:29.680> cards<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.370> English<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
imagine this these cards in English I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.240 
imagine this these cards in English I
guess<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.550> tornado<00:02:37.090> CX<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.950> don't

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
guess so that tornado CX not I don't

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.490 
guess so that tornado CX not I don't
have<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.370> full<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.510> got<00:02:41.290> that

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
have the full out of this but I got that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.680 
have the full out of this but I got that
got<00:02:41.620> these<00:02:41.770> from<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.010> guy<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.160> youtube<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.390> kind

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
got these from a guy on youtube so kind

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.570 
got these from a guy on youtube so kind
of<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> waste<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.170> money<00:02:44.320> now<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.430> other

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
of a waste of money now that the other

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.070 
of a waste of money now that the other
ones<00:02:45.730> are<00:02:45.820> coming<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.560> right<00:02:47.560> Huey<00:02:47.830> X<00:02:48.070> as<00:02:48.310> well

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
ones are coming out right Huey X as well

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.180 
ones are coming out right Huey X as well
so<00:02:50.080> i<00:02:50.110> guess<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.410> look<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.070> last

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
so i guess to look like this and last

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.260 
so i guess to look like this and last
pokemon<00:02:51.430> does<00:02:51.700> something<00:02:51.940> completely

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
pokemon does something completely

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.610 
pokemon does something completely
different<00:02:52.450> which<00:02:52.870> i<00:02:53.020> doubt<00:02:53.080> they<00:02:53.470> will

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
different which i doubt they will

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.229 
different which i doubt they will
because<00:02:53.830> they<00:02:53.950> haven't<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.310> last<00:02:54.489> few

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
because they haven't in the last few

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.949 
because they haven't in the last few
sets<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.030> called<00:02:58.360> black<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.810> white

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
sets so that it's called black and white

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.770 
sets so that it's called black and white
dark<00:02:59.470> explorers<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.670> guess<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.150> dark<00:03:01.360> rye<00:03:01.540> TX

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
dark explorers I guess the dark rye TX

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.220 
dark explorers I guess the dark rye TX
supposed<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.320> really<00:03:02.470> good<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.550> guess

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
supposed to be really good and I guess

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100 
supposed to be really good and I guess
with<00:03:05.230> new<00:03:05.440> 2x<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.310> dark<00:03:06.880> rye<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.690> will<00:03:07.959> be<00:03:08.080> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
with new 2x and dark rye it will be a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.990 
with new 2x and dark rye it will be a
really<00:03:08.500> good<00:03:08.650> too<00:03:08.890> one-two<00:03:09.670> punch

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
really good too one-two punch

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.090 
really good too one-two punch
combination<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.620> should<00:03:11.830> be<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> good

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
combination so that should be a good

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.640 
combination so that should be a good
