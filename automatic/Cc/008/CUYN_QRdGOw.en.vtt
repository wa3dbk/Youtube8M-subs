00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.409
 hi all guys are zodiacs and well 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.270
 found on the canal of the jtf cannes 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.189
 today I 'm alone here for kander 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.500
 it wasn't so good so I didn't have it 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.259
 want to comment but passed the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.689
 game and I'll do everything there I still have then 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.410
 this is a cam strike with 45 gases 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.789
 redone with the weapon sa 805 on the map 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.950
 took a break 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.770
 the map is pretty i don't like it 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.050
 very sincerely I don't know about you though not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.380
 was obviously like it because he did 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.390
 really a nice gameplay if you played it 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.420
 mainly here on the alpha flag e 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.610
 there was a good idea of enemies returning 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.940
 sometimes on the way to getting some 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.070
 kill nothing then and today I have several 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
 things to ask and to tell you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.800
 because I always want you active below 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.930
 in the comments 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.090
 and we leave immediately we start with the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.880
 small survey then to understand 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.120
 better what you like to see now 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.550
 words I will make some kind of proposals 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.030
 and after you in the comments you will do something 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.130
 of ladder writing what the thing that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.380
 prefer more on top and what 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.800
 Prefer less down 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.540
 then the options are ken strike with 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.540
 strange weapons that can be with 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.970
 bmr sewing guns that I am 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.340
 swatch mk and those there apologize then a 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.620
 shotgun when we make preserves 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.840
 which the pump and you snipers 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.010
 we hope others as soon as possible 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 options are fast cam strikes that are 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.110
 under 100 seconds blitz is more or less 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.450
 under 3 minutes in the domain 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.690
 then double cams that can be in 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.780
 blitz or in domain 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.909
 legance trick social type 40 45 gas 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.240
 now these are the options I want 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.250
 understand what the thing I like best 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.130
 see indeed if you want we will add one 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 third option that a third have 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.429
 fired and 50 thousand 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.220
 another option that can be that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.100
 of triple momo type double gameplay 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.200
 nuclear weapons with scales on two cores 2 s and 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.080
 you want to see from time to time enter 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.090
 the example among the options and so I can 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 understand everyone we can understand 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.950
 what you like to see more 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 committed to making these gameplay so 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.960
 such that you have always been active here on 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.090
 channel then blue boys also know 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.030
 so out of curiosity because there is no 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.640
 cinema that gameplay you lost what 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.820
 you spun things like that so much goes to 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.200
 take it cam strike because many of my own 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.060
 Wheatmates really did 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.030
 elegance and very very beautiful though 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.250
 unfortunately since there are no cinemas are 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.620
 gone I wanted to know a bit too 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 from you what have you lost now do not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.900
 invent what I did a triple that 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.530
 end scoop by going around with the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.560
 slippers on whiteout there is in the sense things 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.959
 mindless what was yours in play 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.490
 best you lost let me know 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.700
 so type does not jump me do not fall 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.680
 the balls to know the things that spin 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.510
 to my companions who are lost 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.950
 precisely for the cinema that I am not 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.530
 which are not the only ones to lose 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.959
 gameplay but maybe you too much to 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.060
 know a little to compare what you do 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.200
 it would have been seen on youtube there was 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.650
 was on the 5th 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.239
 another thing with the advent of google plus 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.209
 I still haven't quite understood with 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.280
 it works because a lot of voice to those who have 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.890
 explained more or less than if you 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.140
 add in circles if I don't have 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.880
 misunderstood every time we 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.190
 we upload a video you get a 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.260
 periore any notification sorry 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.080
 notifies us that we have uploaded the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.420
 video so as not to lose the veil I will 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.030
 I invite you to it because if you really do so 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.110
 may be useful to add to 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.269
 circles 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.820
 take two seconds at the end of this 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.860
 video I don't know how it's done because I don't have 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.680
 still understood a cock plus goal disorder 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.900
 however found a way you add us in 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.000
 such chic circles that every time 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.660
 that we upload a video we arrive 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.660
 always a notification 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.400
 never lose because precisely if you start 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.950
 be a bit inactive on channel i 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.040
 our videos will appear to you more and more 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.880
 down to the point of disappearing and then 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.170
 after hello peppe and you won't see us anymore 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.630
 you will see our videos more unless 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.500
 don't look for yourselves spontaneously 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.810
 will 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.730
 then guys I think I told you 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.640
 all for what my parents were 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.290
 topics to come I take fast you have to 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.630
 make a ladder in the comments 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.120
 writing from what you like about 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.060
 more see what you like less 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.270
 of the gameplay I've listed before 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.580
 then I would like to know exactly what gameplay 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.150
 you have lost because there is no cinema 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.520
 maybe the gameplay things they are in 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.290
 earth that is in the sense not bullshit there 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.270
 invent to make jocks 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.770
 I also remind you to add yourself precisely 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.870
 to google plus circles 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
