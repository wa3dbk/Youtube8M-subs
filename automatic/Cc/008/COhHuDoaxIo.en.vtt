00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just like that and i'm drawing a little

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
just like that and i'm drawing a little
bigger<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.040> reason<00:01:08.340> i<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
down we got the start of his tail it's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.179 
down we got the start of his tail it's
like<00:01:20.040> paddle<00:01:20.460> laughing<00:01:20.580> tail<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.470> that's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
like paddle laughing tail and that's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.030 
like paddle laughing tail and that's
gonna<00:01:23.340> come<00:01:23.580> around<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.750> through<00:01:25.110> here

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
gonna come around back through here

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.880

and<00:01:27.400> we're<00:01:27.760> just<00:01:27.940> going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.390> make<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.500> come<00:01:29.860> off

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
and we're just going to make it come off

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.150 
and we're just going to make it come off
here<00:01:30.930> sort<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:31.990> like<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.110> ribbon<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.590> suppose<00:01:35.160> now

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
here sort of like a ribbon I suppose now

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.620 
here sort of like a ribbon I suppose now
I<00:01:36.190> don't<00:01:36.460> actually<00:01:36.670> remember<00:01:36.970> what<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.450> end

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
I don't actually remember what the end

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.000 
I don't actually remember what the end
of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.930> tail<00:01:38.140> looks<00:01:38.380> like<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:38.800> I'm<00:01:38.890> just

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
of the tail looks like but I'm just

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.340 
of the tail looks like but I'm just
gonna<00:01:39.160> guess<00:01:39.460> because<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:40.750> card<00:01:41.050> doesn't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
gonna guess because this card doesn't

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.080 
gonna guess because this card doesn't
show<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:42.100> we<00:01:42.250> have<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.610> little<00:01:42.850> bit

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
show it and then we have this little bit

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
show it and then we have this little bit
of<00:01:43.530> random<00:01:44.530> design<00:01:44.890> here<00:01:45.690> it's<00:01:46.690> pretty<00:01:46.930> good

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
of random design here it's pretty good

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.750 
of random design here it's pretty good
work<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> rest<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:49.030> time<00:01:49.330> echoes<00:01:49.690> head

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.240 

chimecho<00:01:54.760> does<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.270> some<00:01:55.479> arms<00:01:56.190> sort<00:01:57.190> of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
chimecho does have some arms sort of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.780 
chimecho does have some arms sort of
just<00:01:57.460> like<00:01:57.610> curvy<00:01:58.570> arms<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.050> guess<00:01:59.700> there's<00:02:00.700> no

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
just like curvy arms I guess there's no

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.969 
just like curvy arms I guess there's no
other<00:02:00.850> way<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.060> describe<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:02.560> its<00:02:02.740> eyes

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
other way to describe and then its eyes

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.210 
other way to describe and then its eyes
are<00:02:03.250> actually<00:02:03.700> like<00:02:03.850> way<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.570> here<00:02:04.930> as<00:02:05.890> if<00:02:06.070> it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
are actually like way up here as if it's

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.100 
are actually like way up here as if it's
looking<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:09.340> mostly<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.330> basing<00:02:10.990> this
