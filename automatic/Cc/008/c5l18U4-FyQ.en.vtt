00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
excuse me if it's sort of glitchy not

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.740 
excuse me if it's sort of glitchy not
looking<00:02:00.140> great<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.409> quality<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:02.479> actually

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
looking great in quality it actually

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.109 
looking great in quality it actually
plays<00:02:03.110> quite<00:02:03.439> well<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:04.189> tends<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.909> lag<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
plays quite well it tends to lag a

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.179 
plays quite well it tends to lag a
little<00:02:05.479> bit<00:02:05.630> when<00:02:06.200> you're<00:02:06.320> using<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.740> player

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
little bit when you're using the player

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.880 
little bit when you're using the player
but<00:02:07.520> it's<00:02:07.909> okay<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:09.050> can<00:02:09.080> see<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.619> have<00:02:09.739> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
but it's okay as you can see to have it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.640 
but it's okay as you can see to have it
stopped<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> minute<00:02:10.550> there<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:11.470> think<00:02:12.470> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
stopped for a minute there I think it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.620 
stopped for a minute there I think it
makes<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.250> easier<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.760> play<00:02:13.970> slows

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
makes it a little easier to play slows

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.349 
makes it a little easier to play slows
it<00:02:14.840> down<00:02:14.870> slightly
