00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
a cool mechanism down there motor hooked

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.560 
a cool mechanism down there motor hooked
up<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.130> can<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.189> show<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> made<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
put water right there put some batteries

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349 
put water right there put some batteries
in<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> connected<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.210> real

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
in it connected it to that it's the real

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.609 
in it connected it to that it's the real
motor<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> batteries<00:00:28.230> are

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
motor where the batteries are

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550 
motor where the batteries are
put<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.250> there<00:00:29.550> uh-huh<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.960> turns<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
put that on there uh-huh it turns that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
put that on there uh-huh it turns that
gear<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.180> makes<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.750> chain

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
gear like this and it makes that chain

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
gear like this and it makes that chain
spin<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:36.320> put<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.649> pieces<00:00:38.010> inside<00:00:38.820> there

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
spin and I put these pieces inside there

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
spin and I put these pieces inside there
so<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.379> hook<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> don't<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.790> stay

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
so to hook them on don't make them stay
