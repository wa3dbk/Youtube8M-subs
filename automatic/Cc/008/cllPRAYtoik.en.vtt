00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
to take into account that the indominus

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850 
to take into account that the indominus
rex<00:02:08.489> had<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> battle<00:02:09.179> three<00:02:09.750> velociraptors<00:02:10.619> at

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
once right before she fought the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.210 
once right before she fought the
t-rex<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.360> Owen<00:02:15.690> Grady<00:02:15.930> fie<00:02:16.290> shooting

his<00:02:17.370> rifle<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:18.090> her<00:02:18.300> as<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.460> this<00:02:20.460> kind<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
his rifle at her as well so this kind of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.670 
his rifle at her as well so this kind of
illustrates<00:02:21.630> my<00:02:21.780> point<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> indominus

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
illustrates my point that the indominus

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.190 
illustrates my point that the indominus
rex<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.670> fight<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> t-rex<00:02:24.390> was

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
rex in the fight with the t-rex was

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.740 
rex in the fight with the t-rex was
going<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.710> nowhere<00:02:26.220> near<00:02:26.580> fresh<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.360> her

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
going in nowhere near fresh as her

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.800 
going in nowhere near fresh as her
ability<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:29.010> mean<00:02:29.640> another<00:02:30.060> thing<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.480> she<00:02:30.660> had

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
ability I mean another thing is she had

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.040 
ability I mean another thing is she had
a<00:02:30.860> door<00:02:31.860> almost<00:02:32.130> closed<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.760> her<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> giant

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
a door almost closed on her like a giant

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.290 
a door almost closed on her like a giant
electric<00:02:34.350> door<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:35.670> slammed<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.180> her

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
electric door they was slammed on her

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.970 
electric door they was slammed on her
now<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.780> course<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.860> they

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
now of course I don't think that they

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
now of course I don't think that they
did<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.460> did<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.880> whole<00:02:39.180> lot<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.420> damage<00:02:39.750> but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
did that did a whole lot of damage but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.660 
did that did a whole lot of damage but
it's<00:02:40.650> still<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.040> more<00:02:41.190> thing<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's still one more thing that the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.760 
it's still one more thing that the
indominus<00:02:42.000> rex<00:02:42.240> went<00:02:42.630> through<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.380> this

now this is the big question could Rexy

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.249 
now this is the big question could Rexy
in<00:04:32.750> her<00:04:32.960> prime<00:04:33.319> take<00:04:34.069> out<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.460> indominus<00:04:34.759> rex

in her prime take out the indominus rex

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.730 
in her prime take out the indominus rex
so<00:04:36.259> if<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:37.099> took<00:04:37.430> Rexy<00:04:38.030> in<00:04:38.270> her<00:04:38.449> prime<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.139> put

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
so if we took Rexy in her prime and put

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.279 
so if we took Rexy in her prime and put
her<00:04:39.919> up<00:04:40.129> against<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.759> indominus<00:04:41.120> rex<00:04:41.419> that

and she got one of them fairly easily

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.869 
and she got one of them fairly easily
so<00:05:34.550> Rexy<00:05:35.389> just<00:05:36.319> in<00:05:36.650> simple<00:05:37.039> terms<00:05:37.430> she's<00:05:37.729> an

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
so Rexy just in simple terms she's an

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.529 
so Rexy just in simple terms she's an
absolute<00:05:38.360> beast<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.680> believe<00:05:40.069> with<00:05:40.940> Rexy

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
absolute beast and I believe with Rexy

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.450 
absolute beast and I believe with Rexy
being<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:41.990> her<00:05:42.080> prime<00:05:42.379> fighting<00:05:43.009> against<00:05:43.339> the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
being in her prime fighting against the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.240 
being in her prime fighting against the
indominus<00:05:43.729> rex<00:05:44.000> being<00:05:44.479> through<00:05:44.839> the<00:05:45.110> all<00:05:46.069> the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
indominus rex being through the all the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.790 
indominus rex being through the all the
ordeal<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:47.089> went<00:05:47.419> through<00:05:47.629> in<00:05:47.900> that<00:05:48.500> long

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
ordeal that it went through in that long

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.740 
ordeal that it went through in that long
day<00:05:49.129> that<00:05:49.490> took<00:05:49.669> place<00:05:49.849> in<00:05:50.029> Jurassic<00:05:50.389> world<00:05:50.569> I

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
day that took place in Jurassic world I

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.200 
day that took place in Jurassic world I
do<00:05:50.839> believe<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.860> Rexy<00:05:52.669> could<00:05:52.879> beat<00:05:53.029> the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
do believe that Rexy could beat the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.540 
do believe that Rexy could beat the
indominus<00:05:53.449> rex<00:05:53.810> now<00:05:54.529> at<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:54.919> same<00:05:55.099> time<00:05:55.159> i

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
indominus rex now at the same time i

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.429 
indominus rex now at the same time i
also<00:05:55.789> think<00:05:56.210> that<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.389> indominus<00:05:56.750> rex<00:05:57.020> could

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:57.439 
also think that the indominus rex could

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.499 
also think that the indominus rex could
have<00:05:57.589> a<00:05:57.620> chance<00:05:57.889> of<00:05:58.069> beating<00:05:58.219> Rexy<00:05:58.759> it's<00:05:59.300> about

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
have a chance of beating Rexy it's about

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.559 
have a chance of beating Rexy it's about
sixes<00:06:00.199> at<00:06:00.349> that<00:06:00.500> point<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.069> it's<00:06:02.060> very<00:06:02.389> very

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
sixes at that point and it's very very

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.269 
sixes at that point and it's very very
hard<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:03.050> determine<00:06:03.379> who<00:06:03.650> would<00:06:03.770> win<00:06:03.949> but<00:06:04.129> i<00:06:04.159> do

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
hard to determine who would win but i do

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.209 
hard to determine who would win but i do
think<00:06:04.789> that<00:06:05.089> a<00:06:05.449> younger<00:06:06.139> Rexy<00:06:06.620> would<00:06:06.889> fare

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
think that a younger Rexy would fare

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.019 
think that a younger Rexy would fare
much<00:06:07.699> better<00:06:07.870> soloing<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:08.900> indominus<00:06:09.650> rex<00:06:10.029> so

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
much better soloing and indominus rex so

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.179 
much better soloing and indominus rex so
here's<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.569> big<00:06:11.750> question<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:12.680> question

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189 
here's the big question the question

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.659 
here's the big question the question
everybody<00:06:13.879> wants<00:06:13.969> answered<00:06:14.599> could<00:06:15.529> Rexy<00:06:16.400> in

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
everybody wants answered could Rexy in

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.379 
everybody wants answered could Rexy in
her<00:06:17.240> prime<00:06:17.629> beat<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.430> indominus<00:06:19.430> rex<00:06:19.789> that<00:06:20.240> is

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
her prime beat and indominus rex that is

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.510 
her prime beat and indominus rex that is
fresh<00:06:20.750> out<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:20.990> its<00:06:21.229> paddock<00:06:21.650> and<00:06:21.770> ready<00:06:21.979> to<00:06:22.069> go

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
fresh out of its paddock and ready to go

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.079 
fresh out of its paddock and ready to go
now<00:06:22.939> Rexy<00:06:23.419> of<00:06:23.599> course<00:06:23.960> does<00:06:24.349> have<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:25.370> hunting

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.089 
now Rexy of course does have the hunting

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.420 
now Rexy of course does have the hunting
skill<00:06:26.449> still<00:06:26.870> if<00:06:27.169> we're<00:06:27.710> taking<00:06:28.039> her<00:06:28.159> in<00:06:28.279> her

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
skill still if we're taking her in her

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.640 
skill still if we're taking her in her
prime<00:06:28.610> and<00:06:29.000> I<00:06:29.389> assumed<00:06:29.839> that<00:06:29.990> Rexy<00:06:30.409> and<00:06:30.529> her

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
prime and I assumed that Rexy and her

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.029 
prime and I assumed that Rexy and her
prime<00:06:30.949> would<00:06:31.550> be<00:06:31.990> possibly<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.080> year<00:06:33.680> or<00:06:33.860> two

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
prime would be possibly a year or two

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.279 
prime would be possibly a year or two
following<00:06:34.550> Jurassic<00:06:35.089> world<00:06:35.270> because<00:06:36.050> she's

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
following Jurassic world because she's

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.360 
following Jurassic world because she's
still<00:06:36.560> super<00:06:37.399> powerful<00:06:37.699> super<00:06:38.680> strong

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
still super powerful super strong

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.719 
still super powerful super strong
and<00:06:40.490> then<00:06:41.060> she<00:06:41.300> has<00:06:41.419> two<00:06:41.750> years<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:42.729> experience

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
and then she has two years of experience

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:44.980 
and then she has two years of experience
hunting<00:06:43.940> out<00:06:44.240> in<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.449> wild<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:44.900> the

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
hunting out in the wild and the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.570 
hunting out in the wild and the
indominus<00:06:45.290> rex<00:06:45.560> doesn't<00:06:46.310> have<00:06:46.430> that

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
indominus rex doesn't have that

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.790 
indominus rex doesn't have that
experience<00:06:46.970> so<00:06:47.750> this<00:06:47.900> is<00:06:48.050> really<00:06:48.320> interesting

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
experience so this is really interesting

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.000 
experience so this is really interesting
to<00:06:48.919> me<00:06:49.150> but<00:06:50.150> at<00:06:50.210> the<00:06:50.810> same<00:06:51.110> time<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:51.650> indominus

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
to me but at the same time the indominus

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.750 
to me but at the same time the indominus
rex<00:06:52.370> has<00:06:53.240> those<00:06:53.600> arms<00:06:54.139> it<00:06:54.320> can<00:06:54.500> camouflage<00:06:54.800> its

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
rex has those arms it can camouflage its

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.000 
rex has those arms it can camouflage its
height<00:06:56.120> is<00:06:56.330> extremely<00:06:56.990> extremely<00:06:57.199> tough

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
height is extremely extremely tough

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.820 
height is extremely extremely tough
so<00:06:58.550> really<00:06:59.000> similar<00:06:59.780> to<00:07:00.139> the<00:07:00.260> last<00:07:00.530> battle

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
so really similar to the last battle

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.370 
so really similar to the last battle
this<00:07:01.310> one<00:07:01.580> could<00:07:01.850> go<00:07:02.060> either<00:07:02.300> way<00:07:02.479> because

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
this one could go either way because

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.580 
this one could go either way because
it's<00:07:03.889> just<00:07:04.190> so<00:07:04.430> interesting<00:07:05.270> to<00:07:05.419> see<00:07:05.690> and<00:07:05.960> I

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
it's just so interesting to see and I

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.900 
it's just so interesting to see and I
would<00:07:06.770> love<00:07:06.919> to<00:07:06.979> see<00:07:07.190> a<00:07:07.220> battle<00:07:07.460> like<00:07:07.699> that

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
would love to see a battle like that

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.090 
would love to see a battle like that
take<00:07:08.120> place<00:07:08.300> like<00:07:08.810> we<00:07:09.290> will<00:07:09.590> never<00:07:09.740> see<00:07:10.070> that

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
take place like we will never see that

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.159 
take place like we will never see that
because<00:07:10.610> the<00:07:10.760> indominus<00:07:11.060> rex<00:07:11.360> was<00:07:11.690> created

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
because the indominus rex was created

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.090 
because the indominus rex was created
after<00:07:12.580> Rexy<00:07:13.580> past<00:07:14.240> her<00:07:14.510> prime<00:07:14.720> of<00:07:15.080> course<00:07:15.350> but

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
after Rexy past her prime of course but

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.740 
after Rexy past her prime of course but
it<00:07:16.340> would<00:07:16.460> still<00:07:16.610> be<00:07:16.850> really<00:07:17.060> really<00:07:17.389> cool<00:07:17.600> to

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
it would still be really really cool to

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.590 
it would still be really really cool to
see<00:07:17.960> and<00:07:18.199> I<00:07:18.770> would<00:07:18.979> love<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.490> try<00:07:19.760> and<00:07:19.910> see<00:07:20.030> Rexy

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
see and I would love to try and see Rexy

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.170 
see and I would love to try and see Rexy
in<00:07:20.810> her<00:07:21.050> prime<00:07:21.320> with<00:07:21.650> experience<00:07:22.280> solo<00:07:23.150> a
