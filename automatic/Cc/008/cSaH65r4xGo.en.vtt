got the sunglass powder and this is from

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.040 
got the sunglass powder and this is from
their<00:05:58.590> summer<00:05:58.770> collection<00:05:59.570> the<00:06:00.570> brushes<00:06:00.840> are

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
their summer collection the brushes are

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.480 
their summer collection the brushes are
also<00:06:01.169> from<00:06:01.500> their<00:06:01.620> summer<00:06:01.800> collection<00:06:02.250> as<00:06:02.400> you

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
also from their summer collection as you

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.040 
also from their summer collection as you
can<00:06:02.610> see<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:04.970> it's<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.180> same<00:06:06.390> as<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.720> finger

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
can see and it's the same as the finger

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.360 
can see and it's the same as the finger
of<00:06:07.080> fixing<00:06:07.380> powder<00:06:07.590> it's<00:06:07.860> supposed<00:06:07.950> to<00:06:08.250> be

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
of fixing powder it's supposed to be

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.219 
of fixing powder it's supposed to be
like<00:06:08.610> your<00:06:08.790> finger<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:09.630> curve<00:06:09.870> with<00:06:10.080> your

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
like your finger the curve with your

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.670 
like your finger the curve with your
finger<00:06:10.910> but<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:12.419> one<00:06:12.660> has<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.990> higher<00:06:13.140> SP<00:06:13.560> up

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
finger but this one has the higher SP up

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.219 
finger but this one has the higher SP up
and<00:06:13.919> I<00:06:14.220> believe<00:06:14.640> this<00:06:15.000> one<00:06:15.210> should<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:15.990> a

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
and I believe this one should be a

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.110 
and I believe this one should be a
little<00:06:16.650> bit<00:06:16.800> more<00:06:17.010> matte<00:06:17.250> instead<00:06:17.880> of<00:06:18.000> sheer

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
little bit more matte instead of sheer

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.880 
little bit more matte instead of sheer
so<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.479> powders<00:06:21.810> looks<00:06:22.169> like<00:06:22.350> that<00:06:22.620> you<00:06:22.830> just

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
so the powders looks like that you just

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.890 
so the powders looks like that you just
take<00:06:23.250> this<00:06:23.400> off<00:06:23.610> and<00:06:24.000> then<00:06:24.090> take<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.540> cap<00:06:24.720> off

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
take this off and then take the cap off

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.850 
take this off and then take the cap off
it's<00:06:25.229> a<00:06:25.500> light<00:06:26.340> pink<00:06:26.700> powder

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.700 

and<00:06:31.940> then<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:34.620> last<00:06:34.650> thing<00:06:34.979> i<00:06:35.190> got<00:06:35.220> was<00:06:35.729> the
