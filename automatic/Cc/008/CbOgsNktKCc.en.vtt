phonics are now hard to deal with as
long<00:07:12.699> as<00:07:12.849> a<00:07:12.879> person<00:07:13.270> driving<00:07:13.479> them<00:07:13.689> they're

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
long as a person driving them they're

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.379 
long as a person driving them they're
not<00:07:14.650> very<00:07:14.860> smart<00:07:15.250> just<00:07:15.550> like<00:07:15.669> this<00:07:15.879> guy<00:07:16.090> and

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
not very smart just like this guy and

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.909 
not very smart just like this guy and
also<00:07:16.659> the<00:07:16.810> guy<00:07:16.960> and<00:07:17.080> linger<00:07:17.409> he<00:07:17.560> just<00:07:17.680> left<00:07:17.800> his

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 
also the guy and linger he just left his

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.399 
also the guy and linger he just left his
vehicle<00:07:18.099> unattended<00:07:18.789> even<00:07:19.389> we<00:07:19.479> had<00:07:19.629> the<00:07:19.870> key

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409 
vehicle unattended even we had the key

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.159 
vehicle unattended even we had the key
for<00:07:20.590> it<00:07:20.710> and<00:07:20.889> he<00:07:21.699> went<00:07:21.819> to<00:07:22.000> get<00:07:22.180> get<00:07:22.689> some<00:07:22.870> blood

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
for it and he went to get get some blood

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.300 
for it and he went to get get some blood
I<00:07:23.229> guess<00:07:23.409> because<00:07:23.560> he<00:07:23.680> wasn't<00:07:23.830> too<00:07:23.979> happy<00:07:24.009> with

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.339 
I guess because he wasn't too happy with
