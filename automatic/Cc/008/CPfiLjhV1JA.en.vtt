rod<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:09.340> found<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> motor<00:01:10.640> arm<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.090> be<00:01:11.210> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
rod I found the motor arm to be the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.090 
rod I found the motor arm to be the
fundamental<00:01:11.540> drawback<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:12.680> machine

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
fundamental drawback of this machine

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.920 
fundamental drawback of this machine
because<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:13.729> simply<00:01:14.120> cannot<00:01:14.450> generate<00:01:14.870> enough

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
because it simply cannot generate enough

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.600 
because it simply cannot generate enough
power<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.500> turn<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> Dasher

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.700 

the<00:01:22.210> Dasha<00:01:22.420> turns<00:01:22.780> well<00:01:23.020> when<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.380> ice<00:01:23.500> cream

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
the Dasha turns well when the ice cream

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.970 
the Dasha turns well when the ice cream
mix<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.190> in<00:01:24.340> its<00:01:24.490> liquid<00:01:24.640> form

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
mix is in its liquid form

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.310 
mix is in its liquid form
however<00:01:26.980> after<00:01:27.340> about<00:01:27.940> 25<00:01:28.450> minutes<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
however after about 25 minutes the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.930 
however after about 25 minutes the
liquid<00:01:29.470> mix<00:01:29.800> starts<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.310> harden<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
liquid mix starts to harden and the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.600 
liquid mix starts to harden and the
motor<00:01:31.180> struggles<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.930> generate<00:01:32.320> enough<00:01:32.560> power

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
motor struggles to generate enough power

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
motor struggles to generate enough power
causing<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> Dasha<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.210> stick<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.720> mix

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
causing the Dasha to stick to the mix

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.890 
causing the Dasha to stick to the mix
this<00:01:36.520> means<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.120> not<00:01:37.240> enough<00:01:37.510> air<00:01:37.720> is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
this means that not enough air is

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.630 
this means that not enough air is
incorporated<00:01:38.620> into<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.890> mix<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:39.430> you're

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
incorporated into the mix then you're

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.690 
incorporated into the mix then you're
left<00:01:39.910> with<00:01:40.120> cold<00:01:40.420> hard<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.440> rainy<00:01:41.800> ice<00:01:42.010> cream

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.280 

I've<00:01:45.700> taken<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.210> top<00:01:46.360> off<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.600> machine<00:01:47.050> for

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
I've taken the top off the machine for

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.630 
I've taken the top off the machine for
you<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.680> better<00:01:47.890> look<00:01:48.130> at<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.400> problem

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you to get a better look at this problem

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
you to get a better look at this problem
in<00:01:48.880> practice

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.389 

I<00:01:57.020> also<00:01:58.020> found<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> motor<00:01:58.979> arms

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
I also found that the motor arms

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
I also found that the motor arms
sometimes<00:01:59.640> jumped<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.929> also<00:02:01.289> caused

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sometimes jumped up which also caused

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.910 
sometimes jumped up which also caused
the<00:02:01.740> dasha<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.219> stop<00:02:02.429> churning<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:04.409> seems<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the dasha to stop churning this seems to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
the dasha to stop churning this seems to
be<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> common<00:02:05.490> problem<00:02:05.880> amongst<00:02:06.270> users<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
be a common problem amongst users of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
be a common problem amongst users of
this<00:02:06.960> machine<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.160> users<00:02:08.550> suggesting

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
this machine with some users suggesting

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
this machine with some users suggesting
that<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.720> overcome<00:02:09.959> by<00:02:10.349> balancing

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that this can be overcome by balancing

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.520 
that this can be overcome by balancing
something<00:02:11.160> heavy<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> arm<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:13.410> other

something heavy on the arm the other

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
something heavy on the arm the other
option<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.489> hang<00:02:14.640> around<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.239> push

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
option is just to hang around and push

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.869 
option is just to hang around and push
the<00:02:15.599> arm<00:02:15.750> down<00:02:15.959> when<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.349> jumps<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.849> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
the arm down when it jumps this can be a

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.589 
the arm down when it jumps this can be a
bit<00:02:18.120> annoying<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.780> hey<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.879> mixing<00:02:24.239> -<00:02:24.360> sure

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
bit annoying but hey the mixing - sure

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.690 
bit annoying but hey the mixing - sure

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.280 
made the first time that I used it this
noise<00:02:45.819> was<00:02:46.090> something<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.599> I<00:02:46.629> expected<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
noise was something that I expected to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.860 
noise was something that I expected to
hear<00:02:47.500> from<00:02:47.709> an<00:02:47.859> old<00:02:48.099> warn<00:02:48.670> machine<00:02:49.180> not<00:02:49.599> from<00:02:49.810> a
