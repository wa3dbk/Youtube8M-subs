here<00:00:06.550> is<00:00:06.880> the<00:00:07.270> first<00:00:07.780> power<00:00:08.170> on<00:00:08.470> test<00:00:08.830> all<00:00:09.490> my

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
here is the first power on test all my

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.160 
here is the first power on test all my
switches<00:00:09.910> are<00:00:10.210> flipped<00:00:10.480> cables<00:00:11.080> are

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
switches are flipped cables are

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.250 
switches are flipped cables are
connected<00:00:11.320> I<00:00:12.389> got<00:00:13.389> cables<00:00:13.809> running<00:00:14.020> all<00:00:14.230> over

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
connected I got cables running all over

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.250 
connected I got cables running all over
here<00:00:14.920> up<00:00:15.219> here<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.299> back<00:00:16.510> is<00:00:17.050> completely

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
here up here and the back is completely

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.250 
here up here and the back is completely
finished<00:00:18.160> wired<00:00:18.640> we're<00:00:19.390> probably<00:00:19.570> at<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.780> 99

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
finished wired we're probably at the 99

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.259 
finished wired we're probably at the 99
percent<00:00:20.740> i<00:00:20.890> mean<00:00:21.039> there's<00:00:21.519> a<00:00:21.640> few<00:00:21.910> small<00:00:22.090> ones

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
percent i mean there's a few small ones

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.150 
percent i mean there's a few small ones
like<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.710> run<00:00:23.980> 1<00:00:24.279> 12<00:00:24.759> volt<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:26.099> positive<00:00:27.099> a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
like that's run 1 12 volt the positive a

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.439 
like that's run 1 12 volt the positive a
negative<00:00:27.189> connection<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.060> breakout

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
negative connection to the breakout

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.210 
negative connection to the breakout
board<00:00:28.720> so<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.109> has<00:00:29.259> power<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.679> send<00:00:30.070> the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
board so it has power to send the

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.560 
board so it has power to send the
spindle<00:00:31.119> signal<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:31.869> macht<00:00:32.169> control<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:33.570> VFD

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
spindle signal so macht control the VFD

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.930 
spindle signal so macht control the VFD
but<00:00:35.380> i<00:00:35.440> mean<00:00:35.530> other<00:00:36.070> than<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.550> everything

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
but i mean other than that everything

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.889 
but i mean other than that everything
else<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.210> hooked<00:00:37.420> up<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:40.300> have<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.570> power

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
else is hooked up we have the power

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.119

to pop this guy off all them over there
and<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.269> some<00:02:21.480> tuning<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and I have to do some tuning because I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.420 
and I have to do some tuning because I
don't<00:02:22.230> want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.440> tune<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:22.860> here<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
don't want to tune it on here if this

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.720 
don't want to tune it on here if this
thing<00:02:23.640> runs<00:02:23.850> wild<00:02:24.209> or<00:02:24.510> gets<00:02:24.690> crazy<00:02:24.989> mm-hmm<00:02:25.769> who

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
thing runs wild or gets crazy mm-hmm who

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
thing runs wild or gets crazy mm-hmm who
knows<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.269> will<00:02:27.450> happen<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.560> put<00:02:29.459> my

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
knows what will happen so I put my

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.570 
knows what will happen so I put my
encoder<00:02:30.230> wires<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.769> these<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.190> breakout

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
encoder wires on these little breakout

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
encoder wires on these little breakout
boards<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.480> run<00:02:33.750> them<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
boards and I can just run them with the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.870 
boards and I can just run them with the
basically<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.650> wires<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:38.790> going

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
basically these wires here is I'm going

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.170 
basically these wires here is I'm going
to<00:02:39.000> do<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:40.140> unplug<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.709> crimp<00:02:40.980> my<00:02:41.040> own<00:02:41.310> rj45

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to do just unplug it I crimp my own rj45

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
to do just unplug it I crimp my own rj45
connections<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.140> plug<00:02:43.830> them<00:02:43.950> right

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
connections and you just plug them right

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.030 
connections and you just plug them right
in<00:02:44.340> um<00:02:45.320> still<00:02:46.320> waiting<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.650> some<00:02:46.829> braided

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
in um still waiting on some braided

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.860 
in um still waiting on some braided
cable<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:49.790> that's<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.090> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
cable and that's the kind of the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.840 
cable and that's the kind of the
grounding<00:02:52.260> shield<00:02:52.739> cable<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> wrap<00:02:53.519> over

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
grounding shield cable and a wrap over

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.789 
grounding shield cable and a wrap over
all<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.480> power<00:02:54.750> connections<00:02:55.320> as<00:02:55.530> well<00:02:55.560> as

all my my power connections as well as

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.410 
all my my power connections as well as
my<00:02:55.890> encoder<00:02:56.160> stuff<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.780> reduce<00:02:57.900> noise<00:02:58.290> and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
my encoder stuff so to reduce noise and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.759 
my encoder stuff so to reduce noise and
that's<00:03:00.420> about<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.110> hopefully<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.650> next

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
that's about it so hopefully the next

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.840 
that's about it so hopefully the next
video<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.610> will<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.860> will<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.130> some<00:03:05.430> progress
