00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
toes very stressed out so it's important

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.359 
toes very stressed out so it's important
to<00:01:19.750> focus<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.200> those<00:01:20.320> areas<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.100> mid<00:01:21.340> of

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
to focus on those areas in the mid of

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.910

your<00:01:21.609> foot<00:01:21.820> those<00:01:22.810> areas<00:01:22.960> are<00:01:23.140> definitely<00:01:23.829> the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
your foot those areas are definitely the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.980 
your foot those areas are definitely the
place<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.280> cramp<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.670> most<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.180> it

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
place that cramp the most and it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.990 
place that cramp the most and it
definitely<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.680> around<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.310> area<00:01:27.549> as<00:01:27.820> well

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
definitely is around this area as well

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.539 
definitely is around this area as well
so<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.109> inner<00:01:29.320> area<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.859> your<00:01:29.950> foot<00:01:30.219> can

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
so the inner area of your foot can

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.279 
so the inner area of your foot can
always<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:31.060> stressed<00:01:31.329> out<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:31.929> just

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
always be stressed out and it's just

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.990 
always be stressed out and it's just
better<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.619> relieve<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.280> stress<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.700> tennis

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
better to relieve the stress the tennis

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
better to relieve the stress the tennis
ball<00:01:34.179> rolling<00:01:35.049> on<00:01:35.259> under<00:01:35.890> like<00:01:36.130> your<00:01:36.310> feet<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.060 
I think you do is manually massage them
you<00:01:41.079> really<00:01:41.320> don't<00:01:41.469> need<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.679> tennis<00:01:41.920> ball

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
you really don't need the tennis ball

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.889 
you really don't need the tennis ball
that<00:01:42.250> much<00:01:42.460> but<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:43.000> do<00:01:43.119> prefer<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.689> tennis

you<00:02:01.810> know<00:02:01.899> that's<00:02:02.079> in<00:02:02.229> my<00:02:02.380> opinion<00:02:02.679> because<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you know that's in my opinion because of

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.249 
you know that's in my opinion because of
how<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.850> cramps<00:02:04.179> up<00:02:04.329> and<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.780> really<00:02:04.990> can

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
how it cramps up and that really can

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.840 
how it cramps up and that really can
stop<00:02:05.439> your<00:02:05.590> dancing<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.369> cause<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.700> become

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
stop your dancing and cause it to become

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.469 
stop your dancing and cause it to become
very<00:02:06.969> bad<00:02:08.850> another<00:02:09.850> thing<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.060> can<00:02:10.150> do<00:02:10.300> is

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
very bad another thing you can do is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.450 
very bad another thing you can do is
stretch<00:02:10.750> very<00:02:11.020> often<00:02:11.560> like<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.310> know<00:02:12.430> when

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460

a little stretch

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.089 
a little stretch
and<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.300> all<00:02:16.480> around<00:02:17.080> avoid<00:02:17.650> cramps

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
and this is to all around avoid cramps

and this is to all around avoid cramps
my<00:02:19.030> feet<00:02:19.420> cramped<00:02:19.810> very<00:02:19.930> easily<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.470> get

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
my feet cramped very easily so I get

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.680 
my feet cramped very easily so I get
them<00:02:20.980> sometimes<00:02:21.550> if<00:02:21.790> my<00:02:21.970> feet<00:02:22.270> are<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.630> a

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
rests moment so that's also important to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.580

by doing little things like that and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.800 
by doing little things like that and
that'll<00:03:14.080> definitely<00:03:14.769> help<00:03:15.099> out<00:03:15.599> these<00:03:16.599> things

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
that'll definitely help out these things

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.449 
that'll definitely help out these things
will<00:03:17.049> kind<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.349> ease<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.739> muscles<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.220> it'll
