00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
imagine that some data would need to be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.470 
imagine that some data would need to be
duplicated<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> game<00:01:03.210> data

that all the data the game comes with if

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
that all the data the game comes with if
you<00:01:07.170> use<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> blank<00:01:07.979> default<00:01:08.400> file<00:01:08.670> list

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you use the blank default file list

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
you use the blank default file list
that's<00:01:09.390> exactly<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.200> happen<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.770> will

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that's exactly what will happen you will

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.230 
that's exactly what will happen you will
have<00:01:11.340> multiple<00:01:11.970> copies<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> different

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
have multiple copies of the different

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.969 
have multiple copies of the different
files<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.509> come<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> game<00:01:16.170> which

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
files that come with the game which

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
files that come with the game which
means<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.400> could<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> wasted

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
means you could have a lot of wasted

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.310 
means you could have a lot of wasted
space<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.250> vanilla<00:01:20.670> game<00:01:20.880> files

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
space if you use the vanilla game files

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.499 
space if you use the vanilla game files
the<00:01:22.320> application<00:01:23.189> will<00:01:23.280> avoid<00:01:23.670> copying<00:01:24.270> these

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the application will avoid copying these

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.070 
the application will avoid copying these
files<00:01:25.340> back<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> forth<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> you'll<00:01:27.900> only

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
files back and forth and you'll only

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
files back and forth and you'll only
ever<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.530> set<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.759> means<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
ever have one set of them that means you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.590 
ever have one set of them that means you
have<00:01:30.600> less<00:01:30.630> space<00:01:30.960> waste<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> I've<00:01:33.360> already

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have less space waste so I've already

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
have less space waste so I've already

that<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.509> have<00:04:58.570> my<00:04:58.720> two<00:04:58.870> installations<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.919> can

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
that I have my two installations I can

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.100 
that I have my two installations I can
switch<00:05:00.370> between<00:05:00.550> them<00:05:00.849> as<00:05:01.030> much<00:05:01.570> as<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.900> like

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
install becomes active the files for

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.620 
install becomes active the files for
each<00:05:08.440> installation<00:05:08.830> are<00:05:09.340> copied<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.539> out

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
each installation are copied in and out

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.050 
each installation are copied in and out
of<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.870> appropriate<00:05:11.470> directories<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.849> allow

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
of the appropriate directories to allow

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.670 
of the appropriate directories to allow
that<00:05:13.599> installation<00:05:14.259> to<00:05:14.590> be<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.370> place<00:05:15.669> for

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.499 

example<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:21.840> my<00:05:22.840> great<00:05:23.080> install<00:05:23.500> i<00:05:23.740> installed

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
example in my great install i installed

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.140 
example in my great install i installed
enhanced<00:05:25.509> lighting<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:25.990> effects<00:05:26.970> so<00:05:27.970> if<00:05:28.060> i

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
enhanced lighting and effects so if i

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.430 
enhanced lighting and effects so if i
set<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.389> as<00:05:28.539> active<00:05:30.150> you'll<00:05:31.150> see<00:05:31.419> that<00:05:32.260> it

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
set it as active you'll see that it

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.570 
set it as active you'll see that it
appears<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:33.159> the<00:05:33.520> game<00:05:34.389> data<00:05:34.659> folder<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:36.370> is

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
appears in the game data folder this is

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.689 
appears in the game data folder this is
basically<00:05:37.000> how<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.330> program<00:05:37.599> works<00:05:38.699> there's

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
basically how the program works there's

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.420 
basically how the program works there's
a<00:05:39.820> few<00:05:40.000> other<00:05:40.030> buttons<00:05:40.479> here<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.919> duplicate

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
a few other buttons here the duplicate

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.399 
a few other buttons here the duplicate
allows<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:42.849> to<00:05:42.970> duplicate<00:05:43.479> any<00:05:43.720> inactive

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
allows you to duplicate any inactive

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.740 
allows you to duplicate any inactive
installations<00:05:45.070> note<00:05:45.789> that<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.180> installation

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
installations note that the installation

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.990 
installations note that the installation
has<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:47.080> be<00:05:47.169> interactive<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:47.979> duplicate<00:05:48.490> so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
has to be interactive to duplicate so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.790 
has to be interactive to duplicate so
you'll<00:05:49.539> want<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.840> if<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.110> wanted<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.380> duplicate

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
you'll want to if I wanted to duplicate

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.909 
you'll want to if I wanted to duplicate
my<00:05:50.830> great<00:05:51.190> install<00:05:52.020> I'll<00:05:53.020> first<00:05:53.470> activate

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
my great install I'll first activate

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.200 
my great install I'll first activate
something<00:05:54.130> else<00:05:54.400> before<00:05:54.669> trying<00:05:55.120> to

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
something else before trying to

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.850 
something else before trying to
duplicate<00:05:55.620> my<00:05:56.620> grade<00:05:57.250> install<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:58.860> delete

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
duplicate my grade install and delete

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.860 
duplicate my grade install and delete
allows<00:06:00.159> you<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.400> delete<00:06:00.580> any<00:06:01.120> inactive

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
allows you to delete any inactive

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.860 
allows you to delete any inactive
installations<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.360> do<00:06:04.449> this<00:06:04.539> in<00:06:04.690> one<00:06:04.720> of

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
installations it can do this in one of

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.089 
installations it can do this in one of
two<00:06:05.020> ways<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.320> can<00:06:05.409> either<00:06:05.560> just<00:06:05.800> delete<00:06:06.070> it

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
two ways it can either just delete it

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.040 
two ways it can either just delete it
from<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.430> list<00:06:06.610> but<00:06:06.940> keep<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.330> files<00:06:07.599> on<00:06:07.900> your

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
from the list but keep the files on your

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.089 
from the list but keep the files on your
disk<00:06:08.259> in<00:06:08.919> a<00:06:09.220> in<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.639> subfolder<00:06:09.880> or<00:06:10.770> you<00:06:11.770> can<00:06:11.949> have

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
disk in a in a subfolder or you can have

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.550 
disk in a in a subfolder or you can have
it<00:06:12.220> actually<00:06:12.370> delete<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.389> files<00:06:13.659> physically

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
it actually delete the files physically

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.439 
it actually delete the files physically
from<00:06:15.009> your<00:06:15.190> disk<00:06:15.400> which<00:06:16.289> you<00:06:17.289> know<00:06:17.409> is<00:06:18.449> perhaps

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
from your disk which you know is perhaps

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.499 
from your disk which you know is perhaps
little<00:06:19.900> dangerous<00:06:20.550> if<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:22.060> don't<00:06:22.090> know<00:06:22.360> what

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
little dangerous if you don't know what

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.430 
little dangerous if you don't know what
you're<00:06:22.690> doing<00:06:23.970> but<00:06:24.970> anyway<00:06:25.330> i<00:06:25.539> hope<00:06:26.229> this

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
cleared up how to use this program and i
