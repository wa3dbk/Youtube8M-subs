00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
lately and just working on getting my

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.690 
lately and just working on getting my
strength<00:04:18.600> back<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:19.169> I've<00:04:19.320> been<00:04:19.410> saying<00:04:19.739> so

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
strength back like I've been saying so

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.780 
strength back like I've been saying so
after<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.780> bench<00:04:22.140> press<00:04:22.560> volume<00:04:22.860> work<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.550> moved

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
after my bench press volume work I moved

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.150 
after my bench press volume work I moved
into<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.510> overhead<00:04:24.990> press<00:04:25.350> work<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:25.980> is

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
into some overhead press work so this is

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.840 
into some overhead press work so this is
a<00:04:26.190> strength<00:04:26.760> day<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:27.510> one<00:04:27.720> top<00:04:27.990> set

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
a strength day so it's one top set

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.540 
a strength day so it's one top set
followed<00:04:29.850> by<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> few<00:04:30.390> back<00:04:30.690> offsets<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.620> that's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
followed by a few back offsets so that's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.310 
followed by a few back offsets so that's
pretty<00:04:32.790> much<00:04:32.910> what<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.360> program<00:04:33.600> looks<00:04:34.020> like

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
pretty much what this program looks like

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.300 
pretty much what this program looks like
for<00:04:34.620> me<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.919> still<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> lower<00:04:35.730> push-pull

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
for me it's still a lower push-pull

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.600 
for me it's still a lower push-pull
routine<00:04:38.310> Greg<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.360> kind<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.780> incorporated

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
routine Greg just kind of incorporated

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.460 
routine Greg just kind of incorporated
strength<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.880> volume<00:04:42.300> movements<00:04:42.990> into<00:04:43.169> those

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
strength and volume movements into those

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.770 
strength and volume movements into those
days<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.820> that's<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> way<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.180> like<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.450> because

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
days so that's the way I like it because

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.870 
days so that's the way I like it because
I<00:04:46.140> have<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.680> time<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.130> get<00:04:47.310> in<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.550> gym<00:04:47.700> about

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
I have the time to get in the gym about

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.180 
I have the time to get in the gym about
six<00:04:48.030> days<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.540> week<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> figured<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.950> may<00:04:50.160> as

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
six days a week so I figured I may as

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.220 
six days a week so I figured I may as
well<00:04:50.660> take<00:04:51.660> advantage<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.880> just

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
well take advantage of that and just

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.130 
well take advantage of that and just
still<00:04:55.230> squat<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.070> bench<00:04:56.310> twice<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.820> week<00:04:57.180> I'm

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
doing overhead press twice a week and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.590 
doing overhead press twice a week and
deadlifts<00:05:02.430> here<00:05:02.610> i'm<00:05:02.729> only<00:05:02.880> doing<00:05:03.090> once<00:05:03.450> a

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
strength day there's no volume day for

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.960 
strength day there's no volume day for
deadlifts<00:05:07.470> thank<00:05:07.650> god<00:05:07.919> so<00:05:09.680> here's<00:05:10.680> 365<00:05:11.490> for<00:05:11.729> 5

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
reps and feeling pretty good just trying

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.710 
reps and feeling pretty good just trying
to<00:05:14.280> focus<00:05:14.460> on<00:05:14.790> my<00:05:14.940> form<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.390> everything

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
to focus on my form and everything

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.110 
to focus on my form and everything
keeping<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> bar<00:05:16.800> as<00:05:17.010> close<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.550> my<00:05:17.669> body<00:05:17.850> as

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
back stays upright I think it looks

back stays upright I think it looks
pretty<00:05:22.560> good<00:05:22.890> here<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:24.270> should<00:05:24.479> also

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
pretty good here and I should also

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.390 
pretty good here and I should also

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
mention that I've been doing all of my

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.520 
mention that I've been doing all of my
training<00:05:26.669> beltless<00:05:27.240> lately<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.350> last

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
training beltless lately for the last

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.270 
training beltless lately for the last
four<00:05:28.830> weeks<00:05:29.040> now<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:30.680> overall<00:05:31.680> feeling<00:05:32.100> really

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
four weeks now so overall feeling really

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.490 
four weeks now so overall feeling really
good<00:05:32.490> in<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.760> gym<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.330> looking<00:05:33.900> forward<00:05:34.290> to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
good in the gym and looking forward to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.830 
good in the gym and looking forward to
getting<00:05:35.370> back<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.760> where<00:05:35.910> i<00:05:35.940> was<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.479> terms<00:05:36.690> of

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
getting back to where i was in terms of

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.570 
getting back to where i was in terms of
my<00:05:36.960> strength<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.560> everything

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.460 

so<00:05:42.580> like<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.849> said<00:05:42.909> all<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.360> these<00:05:43.810> all<00:05:44.199> this

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
so like I said all of these all this

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.890 
so like I said all of these all this
whole<00:05:44.650> program<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.340> Greg<00:05:45.580> set<00:05:46.090> up<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.509> me<00:05:46.629> is

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
whole program that Greg set up for me is

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.710 
whole program that Greg set up for me is
a<00:05:46.960> lower<00:05:47.500> push-pull<00:05:48.099> program<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.389> that<00:05:49.419> means

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
a lower push-pull program so that means

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.809 
a lower push-pull program so that means
Saturday<00:05:50.470> which<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:50.830> like<00:05:51.009> my<00:05:51.159> sixth<00:05:51.610> day<00:05:51.789> of

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
Saturday which is like my sixth day of

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.710 
Saturday which is like my sixth day of
the<00:05:52.060> week<00:05:52.240> is<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:53.159> just<00:05:54.159> a<00:05:54.280> pull<00:05:54.550> day<00:05:54.759> and<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.479> only

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
the week is a just a pull day and I only

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.600 
the week is a just a pull day and I only
deadlift<00:05:56.229> once<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.620> week<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.009> my<00:05:57.159> dead<00:05:57.340> lifts

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
deadlift once a week so my dead lifts

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.059 
deadlift once a week so my dead lifts
are<00:05:57.699> on<00:05:57.819> Wednesdays<00:05:58.389> and<00:05:58.690> so<00:05:59.620> this<00:05:59.770> is<00:05:59.919> just

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
are on Wednesdays and so this is just

that<00:06:13.810> extra<00:06:14.289> polling<00:06:14.680> volume<00:06:15.159> so<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.030> just

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
that extra polling volume so I just

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.170 
that extra polling volume so I just
figured<00:06:16.509> I'd<00:06:16.780> record<00:06:17.259> a<00:06:17.530> set<00:06:18.159> of<00:06:18.340> bicep<00:06:18.819> curls

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
figured I'd record a set of bicep curls

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.700 
figured I'd record a set of bicep curls
because<00:06:19.330> who<00:06:19.599> doesn't<00:06:19.629> love<00:06:19.990> watching<00:06:20.440> me<00:06:20.560> do

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
because who doesn't love watching me do

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.980 
because who doesn't love watching me do
bicep<00:06:21.099> curls<00:06:21.180> still<00:06:22.180> pretty<00:06:22.330> lean<00:06:22.659> at<00:06:22.840> this

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
bicep curls still pretty lean at this

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.709
