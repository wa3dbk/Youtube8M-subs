00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 Hello dear subscribers I greet you 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.710
 you're probably wondering why me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.120
 this microphone so stupid in front of my 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.950
 It has to hold a face that has a whole 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.900
 simple background i was about to shape 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.230
 setting up microphone stand today and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.119
 so I have to hold his hand 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 unfortunately I have to insert this video too 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.720
 bit silly because I cut it 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.189
 unfortunately not three sets 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.390
 to speak in a row without me 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.619
 I'm completely confused wondering 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.210
 So not when a professional to hard 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 that comes simply because of mine 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 be able to speak freely disability 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.130
 why this video message we have in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 the last days and weeks of you 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.850
 quite a lot of emails and get 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.810
 also inquire about the contact forms 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.240
 our websites 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.460
 why are not there any new videos? 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.989
 and I 'm just wondering why 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 just now picked up the garbage 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.060
 I hope you do not hear that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.620
 why are there no new ones right now? 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.230
 videos that has a very simple 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.930
 reason to be exact even two 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 the first reason is that we are in the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.900
 last days our last holidays 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 had enjoyed 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.979
 and when we had to go back ours 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500
 Company has a real mountain 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.230
 work expected 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.800
 comfort but nevertheless we are 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.300
 again since the second one is for us 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.190
 forgive yourself a huge chance 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
 with him reilly publisher are 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.110
 We do not have a switch book 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.330
 publish 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.210
 and we have his new concept 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 and that connects ours 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.020
 video tutorials also with the book you 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.550
 But you can not be worried 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.260
 you will not have to buy this book 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.030
 So we continue our tutorials 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.100
 can understand that it even works 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.320
 not our goal but the whole thing 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.729
 complement each other by giving one 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.470
 it contains more information for this 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.350
 theme in the other for this topic 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.560
 But at the end of the day is for us whole 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.750
 very important that you all swift can 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.939
 So in the next few weeks we will 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.770
 continue to write his book 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.670
 continue to do our video tutorials 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.990
 but we have to look a bit 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.180
 forgive because we also have one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.149
 a bit of a problem that we have now too 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.159
 old videos have to be redone because apple 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.990
 also a lot of swift itself still changes 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.090
 Of course we do not want that with us 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.119
 so also videos then on youtube 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.310
 are 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.870
 because of course your comments that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 these errors are present now 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.799
 do not go unnoticed by us 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.819
 but of course it's all a thing 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.590
 the time we can not easy 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.569
 go snip and snap that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.310
 problem is solved unfortunately we have to 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.530
 at the moment still all videos then new 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.090
 and if you like a tip 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 We can always avoid that 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.180
 in order to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
 that would be all clear to me 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
 Wish you now in any case 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 first a nice weekend is good 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.640
 in the next week 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.379
 and I'm looking forward to it from you 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.780
 to get feedback again and if you are 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.370
 want to support us does not hesitate 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.170
 our website is going to be blog.de 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.430
 there is this funny little one 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.290
 flattr button under each of ours 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.090
 article and there you can do so 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.019
 make micropayments party and then 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.609
 perhaps it might be by 10 cents 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.040
 send or maybe a euro 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.879
 So that would be great of you then 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.590
 I can continue with that 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.650
 Hirschmann buy water for a salad 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.209
 so that I was not from the tribe and me 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.239
 would say see you soon 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 again
