really<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.550> is<00:02:33.850> awesome<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.540> game

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
really think is awesome about this game

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
really think is awesome about this game
is<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.230> technique<00:02:35.590> we've<00:02:35.770> developed<00:02:36.120> which

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
is this technique we've developed which

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.200 
is this technique we've developed which
is<00:02:37.240> called<00:02:37.450> real-time<00:02:38.080> dynamic<00:02:38.560> slicing<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
is called real-time dynamic slicing the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.480 
is called real-time dynamic slicing the
right<00:02:40.750> analog<00:02:41.020> stick<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.650> allows<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
right analog stick and it allows you to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.150 
right analog stick and it allows you to
carve<00:02:42.760> up<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.210> 3d<00:02:43.660> polygon<00:02:44.200> model<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.650> real<00:02:44.860> time

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
carve up a 3d polygon model in real time

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.310 
carve up a 3d polygon model in real time
so<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.850> directions<00:02:46.270> your<00:02:46.690> feedback<00:02:47.110> and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
so you get directions your feedback and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.860 
so you get directions your feedback and
there's<00:02:47.680> no<00:02:47.830> predetermined<00:02:48.220> animations<00:02:49.210> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
there's no predetermined animations you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.810 
there's no predetermined animations you
can<00:02:50.020> really<00:02:50.320> look<00:02:50.860> at<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.160> enemy<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.640> say

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
can really look at your enemy and say

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.340 
can really look at your enemy and say
well<00:02:52.060> I'm<00:02:52.300> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.570> cut<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.870> from<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.170> side

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
well I'm going to cut in from this side

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.900 
well I'm going to cut in from this side
to<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.650> side<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.160> then<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.340> flicker<00:02:54.670> and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
to that side and then you flicker and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.960 
to that side and then you flicker and
lock<00:02:55.360> stick<00:02:56.370> character<00:02:57.370> fights<00:02:57.580> uses<00:02:57.880> the

Unreal<00:02:58.240> Engine<00:02:58.360> 3<00:02:59.040> we<00:03:00.040> chose<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.490> angeli

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
Unreal Engine 3 we chose is angeli

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.580 
Unreal Engine 3 we chose is angeli
because<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.270> comes<00:03:01.480> with<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.720> lot<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.900> great

because it comes with a lot of great
features<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.040> tools<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.520> really<00:03:03.760> speed<00:03:04.090> up

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
features and tools to really speed up

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.660 
features and tools to really speed up
development<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:05.290> gave<00:03:05.530> us<00:03:05.680> not<00:03:06.190> only<00:03:06.220> a

development it gave us not only a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.760 
development it gave us not only a
rendering<00:03:07.090> engine<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:08.110> also<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
volumetric liquid system we have

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.080 
volumetric liquid system we have
infertile<00:03:26.200> fights<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:27.400> all<00:03:27.520> started<00:03:27.880> with<00:03:28.030> our

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
blood on screens we reuse it to my blood

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
blood on screens we reuse it to my blood
in<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> world<00:03:33.640> interactive<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.810> can<00:03:35.020> comb

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
in the world interactive you can comb

in the world interactive you can comb
the<00:03:35.530> whole<00:03:35.680> screen<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.430> with<00:03:37.090> blood<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the whole screen with with blood so it

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.320 
the whole screen with with blood so it
sticks<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.560> walls<00:03:38.800> or<00:03:39.190> six<00:03:39.370> two<00:03:39.490> objects<00:03:40.060> it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
sticks to walls or six two objects it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.510 
sticks to walls or six two objects it
sticks<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.660> characters<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.070> can<00:03:42.220> slice

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520
