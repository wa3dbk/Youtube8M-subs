00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
personally to me I feel like the actual

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.800 
personally to me I feel like the actual
keys<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.759> have<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.120> mechanical<00:05:16.599> switches

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
keys that have the mechanical switches

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.129 
keys that have the mechanical switches
under<00:05:17.139> them<00:05:17.289> are<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.560> little<00:05:18.400> lightly<00:05:18.880> or<00:05:19.139> the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
under them are a little lightly or the

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.050 
under them are a little lightly or the
Brighton<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:21.039> brightness<00:05:21.400> is<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.880> a

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
Brighton the brightness is a little a

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.210 
Brighton the brightness is a little a
bit<00:05:23.099> brighter<00:05:24.099> than<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.669> rubber<00:05:24.940> donkeys<00:05:25.479> and

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
bit brighter than the rubber donkeys and

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.360 
bit brighter than the rubber donkeys and
I<00:05:27.220> don't<00:05:27.580> know<00:05:27.669> if<00:05:27.759> that's<00:05:28.060> true<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:28.990> if<00:05:29.919> if

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
I don't know if that's true but if if

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.629 
I don't know if that's true but if if
that<00:05:30.639> is<00:05:30.849> there's<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.630> good<00:05:31.780> reason<00:05:31.960> because

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
that is there's a good reason because

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.700 
that is there's a good reason because
actually<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:34.300> can't<00:05:34.509> see<00:05:34.719> it<00:05:34.870> but<00:05:35.169> actually<00:05:35.530> I

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
actually you can't see it but actually I

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.709 
actually you can't see it but actually I
can<00:05:35.949> show<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.219> number<00:05:36.430> pad<00:05:36.580> if<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:37.570> can

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
can show you the number pad if you can

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.290 
can show you the number pad if you can
really<00:05:37.870> tell<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:39.099> number<00:05:39.460> pet<00:05:39.669> like<00:05:39.909> every

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
really tell the number pet like every

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.620 
really tell the number pet like every
actual<00:05:41.289> switch<00:05:41.830> itself<00:05:42.280> has<00:05:42.520> an<00:05:42.729> individual

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
actual switch itself has an individual

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.930 
actual switch itself has an individual
led<00:05:44.020> under<00:05:44.169> it<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:45.280> would<00:05:45.520> explain<00:05:45.789> the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
led under it so that would explain the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.700 
led under it so that would explain the
brightness<00:05:46.360> cuz<00:05:46.810> i<00:05:46.900> know<00:05:46.960> with<00:05:47.199> most<00:05:47.469> rubber

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
brightness cuz i know with most rubber

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.129 
brightness cuz i know with most rubber
dome<00:05:48.060> membrane<00:05:49.060> keyboards<00:05:49.570> they<00:05:49.780> only<00:05:49.930> have<00:05:50.110> a

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
dome membrane keyboards they only have a

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.110 
dome membrane keyboards they only have a
few<00:05:50.380> LEDs<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.039> it<00:05:51.280> lights<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:52.000> whole

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
few LEDs and it lights the whole

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.370 
few LEDs and it lights the whole
keyboard<00:05:53.009> so<00:05:54.479> there's<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.690> brightness<00:05:56.080> go

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
keyboard so there's the brightness go
