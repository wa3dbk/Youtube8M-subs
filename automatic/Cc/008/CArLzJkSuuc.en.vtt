00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 very simple based on proteins that is 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.180
 by chemical decomposition 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 very simple because they are elements that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.070
 we have at home and it is very proven and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.830
 proven that we are going to lose 3 to 5 kilos 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.360
 in just three days is an ideal diet 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.920
 to be in events that we can have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 without this evil for a marriage a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.039
 special program that we are starting 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 great idea deflates and wonderful 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.470
 Rodrigo also this is the first 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 boost also for those who have wanted 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.450
 often lose weight and has 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 cost a lot 8 3 to 5 kilos so very 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.850
 quick then we started we started with 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 the pipe that take note duel and masks 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 and now they are like a half or melo in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.950
 tomorrow to start on day 1 the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 grapefruit here we have it to change medium 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 less means very to one let's start 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
 very easy then we have tea or coffee with 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
 saccharin sweetener or whatever you want 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.199
 but I do not know sugar 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.370
 then toast slices of bread 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.820
 integral 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.680
 and today we are seeing changing the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.060
 graphics so that people are ordered in 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.440
 house take note 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.869
 let's go starting because they are three 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
 days and we will indicate each one 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.440
 of food in breakfast lunch 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.290
 scene we already saw the breakfast we could 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 repeat the breakfast the graphic to see 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.300
 what he told us starting with 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.790
 breakfast but first to start with the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.729
 grapefruit juice or the pombero they eat it 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.070
 well to bits then after 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.679
 We're going poor with tea or coffee without 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.320
 sugar then we go with the slice of 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.390
 wholemeal bread one toast and two 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.470
 spoonfuls of peanut butter 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.470
 about bread 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.780
 a diet based on proteins that equal 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.789
 it has to have some fat or something 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.500
 oil and entertainment because if we do not 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.509
 We are bored and it is a healthy grace 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's butter makes me perfect 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.490
 repeat where this measure came from 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.060
 in the then half grapefruit a cup of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 coffee or tea with saccharin or sweetener 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.530
 slice of whole wheat toast two 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.930
 spoons races of handyman and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.220
 it would be all for breakfast or that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.030
 then we go with lunch on day 1 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 lunch on day 1 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.460
 half chicken breast copay a steak 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.850
 200 grams that can be grilled 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.800
 only seasoned with salt and pepper that 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.390
 it is essential because one likes to throw 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.240
 many things but only salt and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.790
 pepper to flavor the meat a 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.490
 cup of green beans a cup of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.680
 these branches and for dessert an apple 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.560
 little girl and two pretty ice cream 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.050
 vanilla look at the thanks what is it 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.820
 the background also said you do not have to be 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.100
 so strict that you version creations of 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.810
 the diet and half of peanut butter 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.810
 some water balls 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.420
 it's really to change the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 ship a little thank you everyone goes 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.820
 changing what until then 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.410
 we repeat lunch we go in the bag 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.560
 of hand if it would be half chicken breast 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.080
 payment has cooked to the water and now for the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.270
 clear with salt and pepper salad 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.390
 vegetables a cup of green bean a 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.790
 rare cup of tea to or steam your 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.230
 blankets bonuses and really steamed yes 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.680
 because we can not use oil in any 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.660
 another condiment we already need and from 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.640
 dessert for lunch base for the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.950
 lunch that they have a small in 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.750
 gallito is the little apple and the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.850
 balls from the side of performing a girl 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.560
 with peels of the many is important 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.300
 also nutrition is so good 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.830
 as also of course I recommend 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.510
 have supermarket buy were more 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.890
 pretty little girls want to order that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.240
 I had concentrated on finding the most 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.590
 kids is that the amounts 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.210
 they are also essential not 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.220
 psychologically he feels that he is 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.020
 eating a lot eating slow and a 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.150
 little bit and you go to third party 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.040
 satisfaction you take more quickly and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.210
 you have the feeling of being satisfied 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.700
 and with feet 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.280
 therefore complement a data to the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.830
 diet that a friend of mine made was taking two 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 water glasses took two glasses of water 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.330
 so that the return will remain and 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.230
 prepared more filled and then lunch 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.700
 quietly, I always do that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.410
 also to the diets part is 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.840
 take many websites that are sacred 2 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.100
 liters of water at least in addition and 2 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.450
 liters at least exercise is done 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.820
 the water because also prepared the 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.040
 body for food and so not be 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.450
 so desperate to eat and swallow the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.240
 fire took the song will come about 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.430
 everything if they work not everyone 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.280
 It serves the same is important 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.080
 let's say consult with the specialist or 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.540
 with the doctor because people who have 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.800
 problems for example to digest 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.170
 then when they drink a lot of liquid and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.030
 lots of water immediately before the 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.950
 meals may be diluting the judgments 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.420
 Ticos that are basic for digestion 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.420
 so not everyone serves him
