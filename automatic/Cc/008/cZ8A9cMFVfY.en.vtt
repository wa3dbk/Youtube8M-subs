00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
which adds floatation so if it ever does

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.620 
which adds floatation so if it ever does
fill<00:01:55.650> with<00:01:55.770> water<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.490> stay<00:01:56.729> afloat<00:01:56.970> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
fill with water it will stay afloat that
