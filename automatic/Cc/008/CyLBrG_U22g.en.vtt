00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
looking on an iPhone 5 so this is the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.400 
looking on an iPhone 5 so this is the
kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:46.160> world<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.399> war<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
kind of world of war will be be or you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
kind of world of war will be be or you
can<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:52.820> dark<00:00:53.820> metal

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can see it in the kind of dark metal

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.209 
can see it in the kind of dark metal
games<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.230> all<00:00:55.350> those<00:00:55.559> graphics<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
games but all those graphics are a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
games but all those graphics are a
little<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:56.699> better<00:00:56.879> than<00:00:57.719> those<00:00:57.989> games<00:00:58.969> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
little bit better than those games and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.140 
little bit better than those games and
that's<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> think<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that's what I think so this is how you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.830 
that's what I think so this is how you
attack<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.750> enemies<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.630> swipe<00:01:09.630> your

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
attack your enemies when you swipe your

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
attack your enemies when you swipe your
finger<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> left<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.790> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:02:00.649 

but<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> isn't<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> book
