your<00:01:04.799> set<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.369> nicely<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
your set really nicely and the way I see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
your set really nicely and the way I see
it<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> initially<00:01:07.140> setting<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.740> dragon<00:01:08.100> dams

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it is initially setting up dragon dams

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
it is initially setting up dragon dams
now<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> give<00:01:09.030> yourself<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> good<00:01:09.420> amount<00:01:09.600> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
now you give yourself a good amount of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
now you give yourself a good amount of
hit<00:01:09.840> point<00:01:10.049> both<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.560> defenses<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.159> keep

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hit point both your defenses will keep

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
hit point both your defenses will keep
you<00:01:11.490> fairly<00:01:11.820> healthy<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.110> your

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you fairly healthy and over time your

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
you fairly healthy and over time your
speed<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.770> grow<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.180> way<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
speed will grow so the way I see it is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
speed will grow so the way I see it is
yourself<00:01:16.140> dragon<00:01:16.530> dance<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
yourself dragon dance if they're not to
hit<00:01:18.509> kale<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.259> roost<00:01:19.650> dragon<00:01:20.100> dance

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hit kale and you can roost dragon dance

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
hit kale and you can roost dragon dance
and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.640> start<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.390> chaos<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and then start going for some chaos with

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
and then start going for some chaos with
a<00:01:21.990> ridiculous<00:01:22.590> amount<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> speed<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.670> very

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
a ridiculous amount of speed and a very

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780 
speedy nature on an 80 base speed
doesn't<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.590> make<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> lot<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.070> sense<00:02:38.250> they

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
doesn't really make a lot of sense they

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.150 
doesn't really make a lot of sense they
can<00:02:38.940> still<00:02:39.180> come<00:02:39.330> through<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.920> that's<00:02:40.920> like

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
can still come through and that's like

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.350 
can still come through and that's like
what<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.520> about<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.880> pokemon<00:02:42.240> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
what I like about this pokemon that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.970 
what I like about this pokemon that
right<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:42.930> boom<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.620> already<00:02:43.740> have<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
right there boom we can already have a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.770 
right there boom we can already have a
special<00:02:44.430> set<00:02:44.640> that's<00:02:45.150> gonna<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.600> for

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
special set that's gonna be more for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.420 
special set that's gonna be more for
doubles<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.410> single<00:02:46.740> set<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.310> the

doubles and then a single set for the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.680 
doubles and then a single set for the
dragon<00:02:47.730> hands<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.270> still<00:02:48.450> run<00:02:48.540> the
