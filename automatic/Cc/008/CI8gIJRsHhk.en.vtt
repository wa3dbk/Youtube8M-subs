me putting these in the soup uncooked
one<00:06:25.600> because<00:06:26.110> they<00:06:26.320> will<00:06:26.500> get<00:06:26.650> extremely

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
one because they will get extremely

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.610 
one because they will get extremely
soggy<00:06:28.060> because<00:06:28.660> they<00:06:28.840> will<00:06:28.990> just<00:06:29.169> sit<00:06:29.410> there

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
soggy because they will just sit there

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.370 
soggy because they will just sit there
and<00:06:29.770> absorb<00:06:30.250> all<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:31.810> sauce<00:06:32.080> and

and absorb all of the the sauce and

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.600 
and absorb all of the the sauce and
you'll<00:06:32.800> lose<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.190> lot<00:06:33.640> of<00:06:33.790> your<00:06:35.070> sauce<00:06:36.070> because
