00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
face either so that's a great feature

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.610 
face either so that's a great feature
about<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.820> case<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.410> many

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
about this case so we have many

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.240 
about this case so we have many
different<00:02:41.980> colors<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:43.090> case<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:44.250> but

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
different colors in this case and but

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.610 
different colors in this case and but
which<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.520> great<00:02:45.760> because<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.390> iPod<00:02:47.320> Touch

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
which is great because the iPod Touch
also<00:02:48.040> comes<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.460> many<00:02:48.610> different<00:02:48.790> colors<00:02:49.000> so

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
also comes in many different colors so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.630 
also comes in many different colors so
you<00:02:49.450> can<00:02:49.570> match<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.830> color<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.460> colour

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
you can match the color so for colour

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
slightly more protection because all of

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.250 
slightly more protection because all of
