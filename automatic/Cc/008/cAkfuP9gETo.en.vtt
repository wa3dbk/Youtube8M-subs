Aaron

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.350 
Aaron
the<00:02:18.150> king<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.599> Dermaroller<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.970> absolutely<00:02:20.970> no

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the king of Dermaroller is absolutely no

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.690 
the king of Dermaroller is absolutely no
pressure<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.319> what<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.129> very<00:02:23.160> very

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
pressure so what we do is very very

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.030 
pressure so what we do is very very
gently<00:02:24.120> rested<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> roller<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> skin

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
gently rested on the roller on the skin

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.729 
gently rested on the roller on the skin
and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.970> we're<00:02:27.090> looking<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.510> six<00:02:27.900> passes

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
and then we're looking for six passes

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.240 
and then we're looking for six passes
per<00:02:29.220> centimeter<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.860> different<00:02:31.860> directions

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
per centimeter in different directions

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.780 
per centimeter in different directions
so<00:02:32.849> it's<00:02:33.030> literally<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:35.160> four

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so it's literally one two three four

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.699 
so it's literally one two three four
five<00:02:36.360> six<00:02:36.930> change<00:02:37.739> one<00:02:38.310> two<00:02:39.030> three<00:02:39.629> four<00:02:40.200> five

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
five six change one two three four five

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.339 
five six change one two three four five
six<00:02:41.370> starting<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.510> nice<00:02:42.750> coverage<00:02:43.230> of

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
six starting to get a nice coverage of

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.979 
six starting to get a nice coverage of
everything<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.040> every<00:02:44.280> time<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.760> move<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.209> to

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
everything so every time to move on to

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.089 
everything so every time to move on to
the<00:02:46.110> next<00:02:46.260> area

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
the next area

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.370 
the next area
so<00:02:47.730> once<00:02:48.180> again<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.959> stretch<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so once again I'm going to stretch the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
so once again I'm going to stretch the
skin<00:02:49.470> very<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.130> slightly<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.970> roll<00:02:56.720> that's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
skin very very slightly and roll that's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.040 
skin very very slightly and roll that's
what<00:02:57.870> we're<00:02:58.019> looking<00:02:58.230> for

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.300 

the<00:03:04.050> drawer<00:03:04.260> area<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:04.860> area<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> be<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the drawer area is one area to be a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.290 
the drawer area is one area to be a
little<00:03:05.430> bit<00:03:05.550> careful<00:03:05.700> cuz<00:03:05.880> what<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.180> end

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
little bit careful cuz what you can end

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.580 
little bit careful cuz what you can end
up<00:03:06.360> doing<00:03:06.540> slipping<00:03:06.990> off<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.140> edge<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
up doing slipping off the edge and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.190 
up doing slipping off the edge and
that's<00:03:07.650> why<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.100> always<00:03:08.820> place<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.690> anesthetic

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
that's why I always place the anesthetic

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.630 
that's why I always place the anesthetic
under<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> jaw<00:03:10.740> because<00:03:10.890> if<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.280> catch

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
under the jaw because if you do catch

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.860 
under the jaw because if you do catch
under<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> little<00:03:12.720> bit

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
under there it can be a little bit

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.270 
under there it can be a little bit
uncomfortable<00:03:13.110> for<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> client<00:03:13.920> what<00:03:14.160> I've

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
