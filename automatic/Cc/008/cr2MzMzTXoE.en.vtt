00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
my recent kite is 50 meters now and we

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.900 
my recent kite is 50 meters now and we
developed<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.230> boat<00:00:04.700> we've<00:00:05.700> been

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
developed that for the boat we've been

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.089 
developed that for the boat we've been
flying<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> canoe<00:00:06.960> Hawaiian<00:00:07.470> canoe<00:00:07.919> and

flying it on a canoe Hawaiian canoe and
also<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.580> catamarans<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.730> yeah<00:00:12.139> 100<00:00:13.139> meters

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
also the catamarans and yeah 100 meters

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.910 
also the catamarans and yeah 100 meters
200<00:00:13.740> meters<00:00:14.040> no<00:00:14.610> problem<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:16.080> know<00:00:16.139> no

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
200 meters no problem you know no

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.609 
200 meters no problem you know no
problem<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:18.449> results<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:19.050> from<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.320> 50

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
problem the results we got from the 50

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:39.850 
problem the results we got from the 50
meter<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.039> fantastic<00:00:24.590> yeah<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.920> pretty<00:00:26.160> big

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.780 

huge<00:00:40.860> bra<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:43.410> ain't<00:00:43.740> no<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:44.100> baby<00:00:44.430> kite

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
huge bra this ain't no little baby kite

00:00:46.790 --> 00:01:18.440 
huge bra this ain't no little baby kite
this<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:48.060> 15<00:00:48.630> years

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050 

this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> first<00:01:19.770> day<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.250> testing<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this is a first day of testing and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
this is a first day of testing and
50-meter<00:01:21.960> kite<00:01:22.259> no<00:01:22.590> problem

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
50-meter kite no problem

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
50-meter kite no problem
100<00:01:23.759> meter<00:01:23.939> tomorrow<00:01:24.950> no<00:01:25.950> worries

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:02:23.960 

so<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:30.409> burn

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540 

started<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.230> six<00:02:25.620> knots<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.400> we

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
started out in about six knots and we

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.150 
started out in about six knots and we
were<00:02:26.670> super<00:02:27.360> surprised<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.560> able<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.950> even

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
were super surprised to be able to even

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.960 
were super surprised to be able to even
go<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.700> six<00:02:30.000> knots<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.580> cut<00:02:32.790> some

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
go in six knots and then we cut some

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.550 
go in six knots and then we cut some
waves<00:02:33.240> we<00:02:33.630> went<00:02:33.840> upwind

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
waves we went upwind

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.200 
waves we went upwind
we<00:02:34.680> went<00:02:34.830> up<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.070> really<00:02:35.400> well<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:36.060> was

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
we went up when really well it was

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.840 
we went up when really well it was
really<00:02:36.510> surprised<00:02:36.930> there<00:02:37.590> was<00:02:37.710> no<00:02:38.040> line<00:02:38.490> sight

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
really surprised there was no line sight

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.120 
really surprised there was no line sight
whatsoever<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> kite<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.650> creating<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
whatsoever so the kite was creating a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.690 
whatsoever so the kite was creating a
lot<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.460> lift<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.940> lot<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.360> pull<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:44.610> was

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
lot of lift a lot of pull and it was

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820 
lot of lift a lot of pull and it was
surprising<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.570> manoeuvrability<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.620> had

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
surprising the manoeuvrability we had

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 
surprising the manoeuvrability we had
and<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> way<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.240> just<00:02:48.330> started

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and then the way and just started

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.530 
and then the way and just started
dropping<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:50.340> came<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.640> at<00:02:50.970> dark<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
dropping and we came in at dark and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.860 
dropping and we came in at dark and
there<00:02:51.660> wasn't<00:02:51.960> any<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.410> than<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:52.980> knot<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
there wasn't any more than one knot so a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.550 
there wasn't any more than one knot so a
lot<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.740> resistance<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> canoe<00:02:57.560> actually

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
lot of resistance of the canoe actually

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.970 
lot of resistance of the canoe actually
created<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> parent<00:02:59.490> win<00:02:59.700> for<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> kite<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.510> fly

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
created a parent win for the kite to fly

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.130 
created a parent win for the kite to fly
so<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.520> kept<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.150> tension<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> lines

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
so if we kept the tension in the lines

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.740 
so if we kept the tension in the lines
all<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.500> time<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:05.160> could<00:03:05.340> fly<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:06.150> almost<00:03:06.600> no

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
all the time we could fly in almost no

00:03:06.750 --> 00:04:08.699 
all the time we could fly in almost no
wind<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:08.400> were<00:03:08.910> amazed<00:03:09.210> we<00:03:09.780> were<00:03:09.840> blown<00:03:10.080> away

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.899 

I'm<00:04:09.709> just<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.069> don't<00:04:10.129> know<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.459> anybody<00:04:10.640> who

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
I'm just I don't know of anybody who

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.839 
I'm just I don't know of anybody who
made<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> 30-meter<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.980> is<00:04:13.159> a<00:04:13.189> 50<00:04:13.610> meter

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
made a 30-meter and this is a 50 meter

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:45.000 
made a 30-meter and this is a 50 meter
so<00:04:14.829> this<00:04:15.829> is<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.160> world<00:04:16.340> record<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.560> far

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.000
