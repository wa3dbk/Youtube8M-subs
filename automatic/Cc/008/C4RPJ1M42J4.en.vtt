00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello very good here I am commenting 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 for germain gaming presenting the skin 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.490
 of victorious llana of the second 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.380
 season 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.879
 well before you start with 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.820
 skills let's see how jana 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.830
 interacts with the map at this time 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.500
 let's teach how to capture the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.500
 turret we see the model that is followed 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.489
 and the truth that it would be fine if I want 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.590
 feed the haystack interact it 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.890
 consumption 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.559
 not just a pretty severe detail 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.730
 well now we go to the center of the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.140
 crystals to see how the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.370
 things 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 we remember that it is enlarged 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 I am also suffering when one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.079
 interacts on it with the uc 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.380
 well now we see the model of winning 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.660
 much cooler than both 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.900
 and good now we give way to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.239
 skills first we go with cube 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.820
 fire is the term of all life the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.770
 what makes us good in your kitchen 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.770
 we see that it is the same does not change color 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.990
 now we go with the escudito 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.050
 the shield does not change either remains 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.960
 White 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 and well the w we can not use 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 because it is used mostly 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 we see that it works well it was 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.930
 the speed bonus of movement and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.470
 we see as the elemental 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.470
 my vocation 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 the elemental what changes good is the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.450
 element of the normal skin is elementary 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 that goes out to win the queen age 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.869
 what happens that I wanted to change the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.230
 nuances are a little different a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.700
 little purple 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.320
 and then they get a suit of armor 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.290
 I think it's the head the peak and the health 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 ah 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.320
 well now we go with the last company 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.320
 the last one that moves us away in the Cubans 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.280
 The effect that the 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.220
 healing stars 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 how are they deleted 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.670
 and well nothing more here the skin 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.190
 victorious bullseye spotlight we remember 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.380
 that already a victorious is from the collection 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.700
 victorious that in last season 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.700
 the coal came out 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.739
 good if you liked the video give the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.110
 like and see you in another corner 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.110
