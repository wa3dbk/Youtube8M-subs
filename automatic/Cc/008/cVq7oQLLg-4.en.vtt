another video on how to make raw pasta
last<00:00:21.359> time<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> made<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> video<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> make

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
last time I made a video on how to make

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
last time I made a video on how to make
raw<00:00:23.189> pasta<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.789> made<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.180> an<00:00:24.449> old<00:00:24.600> machine

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
raw pasta I made it with an old machine

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929 
raw pasta I made it with an old machine
that<00:00:25.199> i've<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.320> using<00:00:25.470> called<00:00:26.130> joyce<00:00:26.910> chen

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that i've been using called joyce chen

spiralizer<00:00:27.900> since<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> culinary

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
spiralizer since going to culinary

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.049 
spiralizer since going to culinary
school<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.630> 105<00:00:31.050> degrees<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.800> used<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.489> different

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
school at 105 degrees i used a different

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.810 
school at 105 degrees i used a different
kind<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.600> spiralizer<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:35.010> found<00:00:35.280> was

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
kind of spiralizer which i found was

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.240 
kind of spiralizer which i found was
much<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.300> effective<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> getting<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.559> lot

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
much more effective in getting a lot

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.639 
much more effective in getting a lot
thicker<00:00:38.579> noodles<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.329> also<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.379> lot

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
thicker noodles but also it's a lot

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
thicker noodles but also it's a lot
better<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.100> using<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.420> using

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
better for using it when you're using

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.260 
better for using it when you're using
more<00:00:42.899> wet<00:00:43.200> vegetables<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.040> cucumbers<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
more wet vegetables like cucumbers it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
more wet vegetables like cucumbers it
takes<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> middle<00:00:46.020> piece<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> vegetable

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
takes the middle piece of the vegetable

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
takes the middle piece of the vegetable
out<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.210> means<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.930> actually

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
out so it means that you can actually

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.319 
out so it means that you can actually
spiralize<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.920> vegetables<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:51.149> earlier

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
spiralize your vegetables a lot earlier

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
spiralize your vegetables a lot earlier
than<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> normally<00:00:53.340> use

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
than when you're going to normally use

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
than when you're going to normally use
them<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.059> joyce<00:00:54.360> chen<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.750> found<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.410> had

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
them with joyce chen I found that I had

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.160 
them with joyce chen I found that I had
to<00:00:55.920> spiralize<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:56.789> noodles<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.960> much

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to spiralize my noodles pretty much

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
to spiralize my noodles pretty much
straight<00:00:58.890> away<00:00:58.920> before<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.420> eat

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
straight away before I was about to eat

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.410 
straight away before I was about to eat
them<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.219> spiral<00:01:02.850> hasn't<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> show

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
them so the spiral hasn't going to show

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
them so the spiral hasn't going to show
you<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:03.960> sure<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.500> called

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you I'm not really sure what it's called

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
you I'm not really sure what it's called
there's<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.729> versions<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
there's different versions of it on the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.850 
there's different versions of it on the
market<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.590> purchased<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.700> amazon<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
market i purchased this from amazon and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
market i purchased this from amazon and
i<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.850> there's<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.570> four

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
i think there's about three or four

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.359 
i think there's about three or four
different<00:01:12.960> brands<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.830> exactly<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
different brands that look exactly the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.920 
different brands that look exactly the
same<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.729> as

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
same so it's actually just as

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.240 
same so it's actually just as
inexpensive<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> joyce<00:01:19.380> chen<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
inexpensive as a joyce chen it's just a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.359 
inexpensive as a joyce chen it's just a
little<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.580> bulkier<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> raw<00:01:22.950> foodists

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
little bit bulkier a lot of raw foodists

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
little bit bulkier a lot of raw foodists
do<00:01:23.490> recommend<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.080> joyce

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
do recommend this one but also the joyce

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
do recommend this one but also the joyce
chen<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.130> starter<00:01:26.580> spiralizer<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
chen one is a good starter spiralizer so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
chen one is a good starter spiralizer so
if<00:01:27.840> you've<00:01:27.990> seen<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.409> other<00:01:28.439> video<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.310> this

little<00:01:32.880> bit<00:01:33.060> easier<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.049> we'll<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.590> started

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
little bit easier so we'll get started

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
little bit easier so we'll get started
today<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> spiralize<00:01:37.290> jicama

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
using the smaller spiralizer plate so I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.159 
using the smaller spiralizer plate so I
popped<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.889> then<00:04:02.730> I've<00:04:03.269> already<00:04:03.720> used<00:04:03.840> it
