that's<00:01:27.299> pretty<00:01:27.479> fun<00:01:27.780> looks<00:01:28.170> pretty<00:01:28.320> fun<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that's pretty fun looks pretty fun and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
that's pretty fun looks pretty fun and
take<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.820> over<00:01:30.150> different<00:01:30.479> various<00:01:30.990> areas

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
take take over different various areas

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.890 
take take over different various areas
and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.710> also<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> map<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.900> bigger

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and I also think that the map is bigger

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.219 
and I also think that the map is bigger
than<00:01:34.320> GTA<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.070> city<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.579> GTA<00:01:36.420> 3<00:01:36.930> which<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
than GTA what city in GTA 3 which is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
than GTA what city in GTA 3 which is
even<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.009> tense<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.850> fun<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.570> how

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
even more tense can be fun to see how

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.830 
even more tense can be fun to see how
big<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.250> sighs<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.689> it's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
big it is going to be sighs and if it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.749 
big it is going to be sighs and if it's
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> big<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.740> graphics<00:01:44.280> difference

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
going to be a big a graphics difference

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.780 
going to be a big a graphics difference
and<00:01:45.030> compared<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> GT<00:01:46.380> licensed<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.890> GTA<00:01:47.369> 3<00:01:47.610> on
