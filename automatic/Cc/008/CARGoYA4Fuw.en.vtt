00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.549
 good evening everyone on the menu of the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.189
 video of the day or evening rather I'm going 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.040
 give you a little tips 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.700
 that I found on the forum it's ideal to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.529
 about the samsung galaxy s iii so 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.800
 we hear a lot about custom rom 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 from rome to west bay or other developed 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 specifically for those of smartphones 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.119
 who are supposed to improve his 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.939
 speed his abilities that are already 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.219
 huge by nature me I'm going to you 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.450
 make a small presentation of two 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.440
 little tips I found on the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.270
 forum xda and that really allow for 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 improve fluency and speed 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 execution of the programs of this 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.530
 smartphone really 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.840
 impressive 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.880
 so already 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.400
 I inform you that I turn less under 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.100
 a custom rom the as rome developed by 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.880
 so indie the omega asome in his 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.190
 version 11 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.930
 there is the 11-point version that came out 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.340
 there is little but good I wait with the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.580
 last carnel samsung the official 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.199
 output that version 12 arrives for 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.910
 able to install it and which I did not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.530
 absolutely not complain I've never 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.410
 had a smartphone as fast in the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 hands as stable as fluid but good 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.500
 despite everything I will give you when 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.690
 even two little tips completely 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 awesome that will allow you even if 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.040
 you are under an official rom 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 all that could have been basic to improve 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.390
 really the speed of the animations there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.910
 just enough to make 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 go to the settings of 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.440
 go down in the page of click on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 development options 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.229
 there you will have a message that you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 indicate to take your precautions 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.090
 that she is normally reserved 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.080
 public warned blah blah you go down 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.030
 you go to these two years because here 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.190
 the animation scale of the windows and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 the transition animation scale you 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.720
 see me these two in mind there are 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.179
 squarely disabled Originally 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.459
 installing the smartphone they are in 1 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.319
 1 x or once as well for 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.819
 animation heads of windows only for 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.940
 animation chains of transitions 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.080
 you can test by decreasing them in 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.240
 to 0.5 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.459
 I flatly disabled them and 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.849
 you will immediately see the difference 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 of fluidity in allied transitions 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.240
 when we come back to the desk it's 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
 instantaneous 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.740
 when we launch the separate phone app 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.849
 these snapshots I do not click me 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.099
 open a web page 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.680
 it's instantaneous, it's really 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.959
 radical the difference test you go 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.370
 to be really pleasantly surprised and 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.989
 you will wonder like me and like 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.260
 many more why this option 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.520
 is not enabled by default because it 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.319
 there was a lot of debate for 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.569
 to say that it consume more battery 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.910
 I tell you it's totally wrong 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.930
 I use the phone really with a 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.349
 intensive use 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.380
 see the rest 49% of battery and if I 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.840
 show you hop I'm wrong 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.290
 if I show you since when 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.840
 smartphone is activated battery 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.599
 now it has been switched on for 15 hours 17 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.870
 minutes and 55 seconds exactly 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.760
 so it remains 49% of battery I can 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.950
 make sure that I went a lot 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.310
 on the internet several hours in the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.260
 day 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.780
 I had a lot of calls also with the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.030
 phone I used the navigation 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.439
 with map 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.769
 for nearly forty minutes in the 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.769
 day 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.650
 so really I do not deprive myself I 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.069
 you will not say that you will have the same 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.790
 statistics with a classic dress a 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.010
 official rom 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.659
 because good optimization is when 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.849
 even enough pushed on these custom roms 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.609
 but good for the trick and for both 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.900
 tricks that I'm worth will divulge in the 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.540
 development options 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.730
 you can have both the same 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.620
 speed as me in the transitions and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.620
 in windows and animations 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.659
 so do not deprive yourself and go 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.510
 walk a little in his options there in 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.280
 development options and so 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.629
 in the heads of animation windows and 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.200
 animation leaders transition for 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.659
 disable them 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.799
 and you'll see the difference that's for 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.799
 the tips of the evening see you soon
