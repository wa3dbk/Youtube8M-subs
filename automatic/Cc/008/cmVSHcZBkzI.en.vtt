00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.110
 we continue in it so be it 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.720
 later on we will see the cosmetic industry on this site meet the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.549
 highest quality standards 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.029
 but first 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.989
 in everything that goes up you should lower a 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.829
 the landing gear of an airplane 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.060
 must be able to withstand great pressures in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.289
 in this key element in an airplane is the product of an expert mechanic a 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 combined with sophisticated technology 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.779
 attendees at the steel party 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.589
 is the landing gear of a coffee and 135 of tanger treatment 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.440
 the landing gear comprises a central shaft to which the shaft is attached 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.310
 and the wheels 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.770
 the first step is to create the tree 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 this digital environment works the outer surface of the piece 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.810
 a jet of water and oil in pri to the piety that overheats due to the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.140
 friction 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.060
 the next step is bored 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.240
 Abocar drilling head will give inside of the tree 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 the alignment of the head must be perfect 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.540
 the remains of the cuts are collected for sale to foundries where 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 they will recycle 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.800
 the cutting tool that is used to make the holes in the train 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.610
 landing 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 before being very functional 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 the hole widens on both sides using this tool 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 the piece is cooled once more with a mixture of water and oil 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.200
 10 or without you the hole with it puts printed to proceed to the inspection 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 visual 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 then they are 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.399
 since they will be used in aviation these pieces must have a perfect finish 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.499
 the manufacture of the tree is almost finished 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:20.059
 This uncovering machine joins the surfaces with compressed air and discs 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.439
 of sandpaper 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.139
 and then you have to verify the dimensions of the earth 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.659
 This digital machine has three axes and perform verification with the maximum 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.659
 precision 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679
 there is another unit to work the larger pieces 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:52.779
 In these facilities, also used landing gear such as 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.839
 this one of a bo and 7 0 7 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.189
 first the paint is removed with a sandblast to check the condition 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 of the pieces 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.809
 however, visual inspection is not enough 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.099
 possible cracks can be detected with particle concentration 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.109
 magnetic 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.870
 the party is magnified and any possible crack will be visible in the light 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 ultraviolet 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.579
 It's time to move to the workshop for the next step spray with steel balls 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.809
 the surface of the metal to increase the resistance to fatigue 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.239
 before picking up the piece you have to galvanize 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.639
 the piece is submerged for ten minutes instead, forming a protective layer that 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.639
 resist corrosion 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.609
 then it is rapidly immersed in chromic acid 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.029
 the water stirred by airplane engines cleans the chromic acid and the piece is 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.869
 rinse in water once more 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:57.180
 then it is baked in an oven at 190 degrees for 23 hours 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.180
 to eliminate hydrogen induced during the bald nicado 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.490
 the next step is to submerge the piece in liquid nitrogen at -129 degrees 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.490
 before inserting it to reduce its size 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.609
 this clamps pushes with a hydraulic jack 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.329
 when reheating the clamp recovers its normal size 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.860
 Then the different components and accessories are inserted into the piston. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.110
 leak proof gaskets 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.080
 the pacentro piston damper 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.340
 this part absorbs the jolts when a plane lands 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.599
 then the piston slides inside the cylinder 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.599
 if it is verified that the shock absorber is approved for leaks 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.770
 the manufacturing concludes when the waist is dried in the oven 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.830
 it takes between six and eight months
