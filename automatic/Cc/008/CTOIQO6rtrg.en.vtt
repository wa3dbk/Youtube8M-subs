00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
think the students really got a lot out

think the students really got a lot out
of<00:00:16.630> it<00:00:16.810> I'm<00:00:16.960> doing<00:00:17.230> little<00:00:18.150> interviews<00:00:19.150> so<00:00:19.599> to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660

of it I'm doing little interviews so to
speak<00:00:20.020> on<00:00:20.259> the<00:00:20.439> remote<00:00:20.920> sent<00:00:21.189> Tio's<00:00:21.430> today<00:00:21.730> and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
speak on the remote sent Tio's today and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.280 
speak on the remote sent Tio's today and
it<00:00:21.970> seems<00:00:22.150> like<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:22.509> got<00:00:22.689> a<00:00:22.720> lot<00:00:22.900> out<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.140> it

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
it seems like they got a lot out of it

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.780 
it seems like they got a lot out of it
and<00:00:23.470> they<00:00:23.619> seemed<00:00:24.220> like<00:00:24.369> there<00:00:24.520> was<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:24.640> good

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
and they seemed like there was a good

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.670 
and they seemed like there was a good
amount<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:25.150> time<00:00:25.419> and<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.810> good<00:00:25.990> speed<00:00:26.350> and<00:00:26.590> a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
amount of time and a good speed and a

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.010 
amount of time and a good speed and a
good<00:00:26.830> pace<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:28.420> tell<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:28.689> what<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
good pace and I'll tell you what the

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.320 
good pace and I'll tell you what the
what<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:30.010> final<00:00:30.250> product<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.670> turned<00:00:30.970> out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
what the final product that turned out

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.229 
what the final product that turned out
ended<00:00:31.810> up<00:00:31.900> being<00:00:32.169> fantastic<00:00:33.000> walking<00:00:34.000> through

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
ended up being fantastic walking through

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.299 
ended up being fantastic walking through
there<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.570> just<00:00:34.690> seeing<00:00:34.960> four<00:00:35.860> months<00:00:36.160> worth

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
there and just seeing four months worth

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.950 
there and just seeing four months worth
of<00:00:36.489> effort<00:00:36.640> put<00:00:36.970> on<00:00:37.090> their<00:00:37.239> display<00:00:37.449> boards

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
of effort put on their display boards

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.570 
of effort put on their display boards
and<00:00:38.110> hearing<00:00:38.320> their<00:00:38.440> answers<00:00:38.800> from<00:00:39.160> the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
and hearing their answers from the

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.970 
and hearing their answers from the
judges<00:00:39.940> really<00:00:40.410> made<00:00:41.410> me<00:00:41.500> believe<00:00:41.769> that<00:00:41.800> it

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
judges really made me believe that it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.219 
judges really made me believe that it
got<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.220> lot<00:00:42.370> out<00:00:42.549> of<00:00:42.580> this<00:00:42.790> experience

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
got a lot out of this experience

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.509 
got a lot out of this experience
basically<00:00:44.229> we<00:00:44.620> went<00:00:44.799> through<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.040> scientific

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
basically we went through the scientific

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.369 
basically we went through the scientific
method<00:00:45.879> together<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.600> basically<00:00:46.870> came<00:00:47.199> up

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
method together we basically came up

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.079 
method together we basically came up
with<00:00:47.589> you<00:00:48.370> know<00:00:48.489> something<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:48.879> was

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
with you know something that was

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.789 
with you know something that was
interesting<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.989> them<00:00:50.140> something<00:00:50.559> of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
interesting to them something of

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:53.579 
interesting to them something of
interest<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.460> they<00:00:51.610> would<00:00:51.850> ask<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.390> question<00:00:52.589> do

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
interest so they would ask a question do

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.700 
interest so they would ask a question do
some<00:00:53.769> research<00:00:54.100> on<00:00:54.339> that<00:00:54.370> question<00:00:55.710> decide

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
some research on that question decide

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.020 
some research on that question decide
whether<00:00:56.979> they<00:00:57.220> could<00:00:57.280> figure<00:00:57.549> out<00:00:57.670> what<00:00:57.940> would

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
whether they could figure out what would

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.689 
whether they could figure out what would
be<00:00:58.089> the<00:00:59.129> hypothesis<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.280> answer<00:01:00.580> that

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
be the hypothesis to answer that

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.070 
be the hypothesis to answer that
question<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.330> then<00:01:01.479> they<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.750> went<00:01:01.930> through

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
question and then they just went through

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.750 
question and then they just went through
from<00:01:02.320> there<00:01:02.440> what<00:01:02.680> do<00:01:02.739> we<00:01:02.890> need<00:01:03.129> how<00:01:03.519> are<00:01:03.640> we

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
from there what do we need how are we

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.130 
from there what do we need how are we
gonna<00:01:03.909> set<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.269> up<00:01:04.390> what<00:01:04.540> are<00:01:04.629> we<00:01:04.690> gonna<00:01:04.809> do<00:01:05.019> in

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
gonna set it up what are we gonna do in

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.289 
gonna set it up what are we gonna do in
order<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.409> accomplish<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.250> then<00:01:07.000> you

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
order to accomplish that and then you

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.570 
order to accomplish that and then you
know<00:01:07.420> around<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.619> little<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:09.010> few<00:01:09.310> weeks<00:01:09.460> before

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
know around a little a few weeks before

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.039 
know around a little a few weeks before
and<00:01:09.790> after<00:01:10.060> Christmas<00:01:10.420> they<00:01:10.570> collected<00:01:10.960> their

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
and after Christmas they collected their

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.170 
and after Christmas they collected their
data<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.619> then<00:01:12.250> they<00:01:12.280> analyzed<00:01:12.760> their<00:01:12.939> data

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
data and then they analyzed their data

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.540 
data and then they analyzed their data
and<00:01:13.390> put<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.689> in<00:01:13.830> graphs<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.160> tables<00:01:15.220> that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
and put it in graphs and tables that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.520 
and put it in graphs and tables that
made<00:01:15.790> sense<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.510> finally<00:01:16.960> spent<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.350> last

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
made sense and finally spent the last

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.150 
made sense and finally spent the last
few<00:01:17.800> weeks<00:01:17.860> concluding<00:01:19.440> summarizing<00:01:20.440> putting

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
few weeks concluding summarizing putting

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.150 
few weeks concluding summarizing putting
on<00:01:21.340> boards<00:01:21.670> putting<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.090> an<00:01:22.270> icebound<00:01:23.160> journal

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
on boards putting in an icebound journal

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.930 
on boards putting in an icebound journal
and<00:01:24.340> turning<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.480> lab<00:01:25.750> report<00:01:25.780> so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
and turning in that lab report so

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.580 
and turning in that lab report so
basically<00:01:27.940> what<00:01:28.240> happened<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.960> took<00:01:29.260> all

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
basically what happened is we took all

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.470 
basically what happened is we took all
the<00:01:30.250> different<00:01:30.550> ideas<00:01:30.640> they<00:01:31.000> came<00:01:31.180> up<00:01:31.330> with

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
the different ideas they came up with

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.850 
the different ideas they came up with
and<00:01:31.690> then<00:01:31.780> figured<00:01:32.140> out<00:01:32.260> where<00:01:32.410> they<00:01:32.530> belonged

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
and then figured out where they belonged

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.220 
and then figured out where they belonged
so<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:34.120> didn't<00:01:34.360> say<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.510> had<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.780> fit<00:01:35.080> into

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
so we didn't say you had to fit into

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.110 
so we didn't say you had to fit into
this<00:01:35.500> mold<00:01:35.800> necessarily<00:01:36.640> but<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:36.850> ended<00:01:37.030> up

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
this mold necessarily but I ended up

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.460 
this mold necessarily but I ended up
kind<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.510> working<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.900> way<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.170> had<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.320> lot<00:01:38.440> of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
kind of working that way we had a lot of

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.560 
kind of working that way we had a lot of
people<00:01:38.770> interested<00:01:39.220> in<00:01:39.370> physics<00:01:40.240> and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
people interested in physics and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.710 
people interested in physics and
engineering<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.970> will<00:01:43.150> be<00:01:43.270> good<00:01:43.420> for

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
engineering which will be good for

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.470 
engineering which will be good for
future<00:01:44.290> upper-level<00:01:45.220> courses<00:01:45.909> when<00:01:46.270> they<00:01:46.360> get

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
future upper-level courses when they get

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.940 
future upper-level courses when they get
more<00:01:46.659> into<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.080> even<00:01:47.260> some<00:01:47.470> next<00:01:47.770> year

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
more into that and even some next year

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.280 
more into that and even some next year
in<00:01:48.040> eighth<00:01:48.159> grade<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:49.360> did<00:01:49.570> chemistry<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
in eighth grade they did chemistry and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.310 
in eighth grade they did chemistry and
biochemistry<00:01:50.770> there<00:01:51.580> would<00:01:51.670> be

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
biochemistry there would be

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.270

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.880 
botany and zoology they were similar to
what<00:02:03.190> we<00:02:03.780> had<00:02:04.780> gone<00:02:05.020> through<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.620> science

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
what we had gone through for the science

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.170 
what we had gone through for the science
of<00:02:05.979> basically<00:02:06.400> did<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:06.760> follow<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
of basically did they follow the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.570 
of basically did they follow the
scientific<00:02:07.479> method<00:02:08.080> did<00:02:08.860> they<00:02:08.950> understand

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
scientific method did they understand

were<00:02:09.849> they<00:02:10.000> clear<00:02:10.330> about<00:02:10.509> what<00:02:10.720> they<00:02:10.869> had<00:02:11.080> gone

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
were they clear about what they had gone

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.830 
were they clear about what they had gone
through<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:12.010> they<00:02:12.190> had<00:02:12.720> stumbled<00:02:13.720> over

things<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.650> they<00:02:14.830> could<00:02:15.040> take<00:02:15.400> away<00:02:15.670> from

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
things that they could take away from

technical information as well and then

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.880 
technical information as well and then
there

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
there

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
around like questions that may have been

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.120 
around like questions that may have been
more<00:02:37.760> difficult<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:39.740> was<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.010> the
