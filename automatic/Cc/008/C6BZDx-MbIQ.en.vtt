00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello guys with you jov and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.920
 today we have a little rida where the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.140
 your hangar developers on super tests 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.869
 showed a new German heavy tank 9 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.580
 level called mammoth and yes guys 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 he is as epic as his 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 eponymous colleague in the red universe 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 threats 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 just look at these 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 forms well the body is a cross between 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.520
 Tank Maus and Tank E100 Tower is similar to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 stock tiger only grown up 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 sizes you can assume something else 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.500
 one super armored car on 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.539
 ninth level 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 but suddenly slip in head 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.520
 bad thoughts and where is the previous one 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.219
 heavyweight ninth level motion 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 he is a mouse where his delhi given that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.730
 this tanchik 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.440
 pretty much like that but 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.149
 but let's not about the poor and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 look at the characteristics of this 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.180
 mammoth what do we have and do we have 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.549
 guys 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 the same stapyatidesyati millimeter 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.750
 German gun that was on 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.520
 scrotum and on e100 and on some others 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.430
 tanks breaking through 225 damage 750 but at the same time 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 dpm some unreal and hike 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 really just test only 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 because as many as three thousand one hundred and twenty 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.790
 eight are almost like y s 10 level 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.189
 but it should be noted that as reported by our 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.110
 sources of super test for this tank 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.790
 very good accuracy and information 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 really like for 150 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.299
 038 millimeter cannon per 100 meters 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's just a great result. 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.270
 lead is generally fine 2 and 6 and this 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.930
 150 millimeter drink repeat to you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.780
 the declination angle is also quite good 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.329
 -8 engine power 720 horses weight 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.430
 tank 130 tons and it turns out that we 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 power density in the region of 6 horsepower 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.960
 force per ton 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.659
 6 Carl if you do not understand what I mean 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 I can tell you that even the current 2 has more integers 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.110
 seven horsepower per ton but guys 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.280
 here we should not say so grieve or 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.599
 cry 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.730
 well or do some other 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.650
 completely unnecessary actions because 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.989
 that the developers again twisted such 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.330
 hidden parameter as permeability by 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.159
 soils and yes they love and they do so 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.260
 love to spin various hidden options 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.420
 to turn some tank some 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.739
 incomprehensible shit so here in this case 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.110
 they twisted only in plus and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.090
 it turns out that a huge heavy tank 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.420
 sizes six horsepower on 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.360
 a ton rides like who do you think how 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.780
 e100 that is, the tank mammoth and the tank 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.390
 e-100 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.909
 the same dynamics that can be 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 historical and more logical of course here it is necessary 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.720
 note that maximal moms is just 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.510
 only 20 kilometers per hour but this is no longer 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.359
 especially important because back as much as 15 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.280
 well and now the most important strength and 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.190
 Of course, the armor strength of the tank 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.920
 very good two thousand on 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.079
 ninth level good result and here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.859
 Armor here guys just wait 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.890
 awesome surprise vlt 100 millimeters 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.310
 the chamber is such an average armor slope 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.410
 hull sides 80 millimeters without 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.169
 tilts the forehead of the tower 120 millimeters under 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.620
 a slight slope of the tower 120 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.230
 millimeters 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.470
 again under a little cardboard here it is 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.530
 guys armor this is yes on the ninth 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.540
 level 100 millimeters l d and just 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.760
 we set records on the uproariness of new 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.919
 tanks in general guys have already told me 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.319
 super test that tank is full cardboard 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.540
 achieves everything in all places even in 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.790
 mask weapons even vld under unreal 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.389
 slopes generally have this tanchik 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.769
 all holes 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.599
 but in this form with this dpm with a very 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.450
 good accuracy 150 millimeter 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.430
 guns with the dynamics of what e100 though 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.099
 maximum speed is small they tell me that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.750
 Tanchik very good and playable 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.780
 the truth guys obviously that most likely 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.720
 and accuracy and dpm will still be nerfit 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.849
 because it is only preliminary 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.030
 let's say such tth and here here guys 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.069
 the question arises if the accuracy of mixing 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.260
 there even dpm is likely to change 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.199
 the smaller side that it was not so 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.120
 Imbo there is what I will do armor that 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.519
 will do armor what will they do with 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.320
 100 millimeters of water so huge 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.930
 tank why is it needed 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.460
 i don't understand well and of course guys i don't 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.730
 could not ask the developers 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.370
 comments under 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.860
 Nam tank they say what it is where it come from 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.650
 and why is it necessary? 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.450
 that the quote I was told today 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 super test went new german alien 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.230
 tank mammoth tank early version 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.600
 famous tank maus 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.040
 the machine was created only on the drawings and 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.800
 so talk about the characteristics 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.870
 the car is still early testing will show 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.690
 where better to put this giant on 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.420
 eighth level or 9 and also what 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.660
 there will be a weapon and armor and again guys 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.640
 the question arises if suddenly this tank on 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.860
 Minute imagine substitute sneaker b 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.080
 why change one paper tank to 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.420
 another same paper made up 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.790
 I personally do not understand the tank, but if suddenly 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.560
 this car is not a replacement for sneaker used as a 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.590
 a separate tank in which there is no 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.720
 know or premium or suddenly for lbz then 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.850
 there are already no questions important to 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.330
 he was interesting and playable they are like 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.600
 now 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.670
 100 millimeters vld it is personally mine 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.380
 opinion but in general guys the introduction of this 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.270
 Tank in the game me a little softly 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.310
 saying embarrassed developers drain 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.010
 shouted about historicity from the fact that they 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.110
 leave from the invented machines and the fact that Islands 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.650
 people 100 will be taken out of the game and after 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.690
 this still fv215b and british st 10 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.000
 the level of it all to us they are so long 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.740
 spoke and then bam and plans to drive 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.800
 the tank that was only on the drawings 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.560
 sense guys sense to choose wafer e100 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.510
 and fv215b and after that enter some 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.670
 moment but this here is my opinion that 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.740
 What do you think you write comments like 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.780
 you such a mammoth and maybe 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.490
 developer next season forehead 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.260
 start the mammoths have burst into mouth until 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.850
 do not you agree that the normal idea 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.680
 can he cross the ground 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.650
 make a good two guns 150 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.120
 millimeters can be put there accuracy 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.740
 good to do there may be 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 drummer and screw there is not well 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.850
 agree will put a good 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.110
 historic tank just like this one on 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.700
 this guys have all click like 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.100
 subscribe to the channel and write to 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.100
 komentah how do you like this tanchuk ciao cocoa
