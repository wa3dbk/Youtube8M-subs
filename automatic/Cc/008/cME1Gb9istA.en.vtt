00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello people welcome again sorry 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.759
 by my absence in all this time but 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.530
 I have finally become good today I will teach you 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.490
 to download and install addons for the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.490
 guerrismo 13 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.640
 first we go to the workshop of harris the 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.590
 link I leave it in the description will be 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.869
 a link of adif line we will have 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.340
 wait 5 seconds and then we give to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.710
 Skip ad 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.050
 I will try to keep uploading more videos 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.850
 followed if they want a tutorial do not hesitate 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:44.780
 in asking me for the comments that 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 they are down once here in the workshop 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.129
 we can see many addons and models 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.670
 you can choose the one that you 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.980
 want 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.629
 in my case although not have the Estadi 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.030
 has the download is only for the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.890
 show usually do not weigh much 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.899
 the addons there are also game modes 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 like the hulk itself if they want an add-on 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.500
 specifically they have to go to this bar 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:16.750
 that I will show you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:19.700
 [Music] 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.100
 here is the one that I look for, we open it and we 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.470
 we ensure that you say subscribe so that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.690
 work if you do not say that most likely 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.560
 is that it does not work but anyway 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.840
 try to see if it works 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.029
 Y 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.029
 [Music] 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.979
 now let's open the limit addons not 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:47.229
 worry about the link I'll leave 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.600
 in the description it will also be a link 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.349
 from atf line again we wait for 5 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.119
 seconds and we're going to skip advertising if 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:59.429
 they want to add me in this and look at the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.429
 description there is my steam and skype 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.509
 once we open gado we go to the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.520
 page where we have the add-on and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.730
 we copy the link and paste it into the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.590
 cat page just like I do him 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.310
 We download and it will tell us the name and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 how many times the add-on has been downloaded 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.890
 as you can see it is the same addon we give 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.080
 new to ground loud and it will start 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.989
 download but there it will tell us that we occupy 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.520
 The gw tool we give the option to 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:43.640
 download it and it will be downloaded 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:46.180
 automatically now we wait for it to 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.180
 unload 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.860
 as you can see he left us two 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.320
 new files the rar file what 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.210
 unzip and leave us the gw tool 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.200
 but ask me that because I eat 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.200
 come and I have it there 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.360
 Y 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.360
 Y 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.390
 if you want we can eliminate access to 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.500
 internet and the run file 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.500
 [Music] 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.010
 We opened the gw tool and we went to the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 program the file that left us the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:45.770
 download of the done 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:45.770
 [Music] 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.379
 it will convert it into a rar file but there 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.109
 that decompress keep it clarified with 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.150
 seventh and if not it will not work in the video 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.569
 I show what happens if you unpack with 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.569
 winrar 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.460
 ah 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.630
 [Music] 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.700
 and now the file that he left us will be 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 to pass it again the gw tool 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.410
 [Music] 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.060
 and leave us a folder with the name 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.199
 of the add-on that they downloaded 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.199
 [Music] 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.479
 to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:44.739
 [Music] 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.759
 now that folder we do not see to our 

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.759
 ga folder rate 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.819
 ah 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.850
 inside our rhythm ga folder 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.710
 we enter again hold mode and then 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.300
 we enter addons and there we paste the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.300
 folder of the donate that we download 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.920
 as I told you I already had the add-on so 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.110
 that's why he asks me that 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.780
 [Music] 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.880
