you<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.960> need<00:00:22.310> two<00:00:23.310> 1<00:00:24.300> by<00:00:24.420> 1<00:00:24.570> slopes<00:00:25.369> then<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you will need two 1 by 1 slopes then you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
you will need two 1 by 1 slopes then you
will<00:00:27.060> need<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.619> 1<00:00:28.619> by<00:00:28.769> 1<00:00:28.949> flat<00:00:29.160> black<00:00:29.519> tile<00:00:30.890> then

brick<00:00:41.840> plate<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:44.070> whites<00:00:44.219> done<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.789> let's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
brick plate and the whites done so let's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.959 
brick plate and the whites done so let's
begin<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> build<00:00:45.860> first<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.399> won't<00:00:47.520> start

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
begin to build first you won't start

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.930 
begin to build first you won't start
with<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.660> 1<00:00:49.620> by<00:00:49.800> 3<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> just

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
with this 1 by 3 right here so just

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.189 
with this 1 by 3 right here so just
right<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> need<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
right there then you're going to need a

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
right there then you're going to need a
1<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.379> 2<00:00:58.520> stick<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:01.640> stick<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
1 by 2 stick that on there stick and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.050 
1 by 2 stick that on there stick and
then<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> stick<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.559> piece<00:01:05.060> one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
then you want to stick this piece one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
then you want to stick this piece one
bellow<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.560> you're

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bellow so you have this then you're

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.679 
bellow so you have this then you're
going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> create<00:01:11.780> whole<00:01:12.780> thin<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
going to create whole thin so use this

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.460 
going to create whole thin so use this
slope<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:16.140> top<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.549> create<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.030> fin

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
slope on top of that to create the fin

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.600 
slope on top of that to create the fin
then<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> white<00:01:20.280> stud

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
then you're going to use a white stud

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.170 
then you're going to use a white stud
and<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.140> slope<00:01:22.470> stick<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and the other slope stick this down to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560 
and the other slope stick this down to
that<00:01:24.590> stick<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.830> onto<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that stick that onto there you see the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
that stick that onto there you see the
basic<00:01:27.930> already<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.159> rest

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
basic already and then rest

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.289 
basic already and then rest
oh<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.900> took<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.820> stick<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> bike<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
oh just took off this stick that bike on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.960 
oh just took off this stick that bike on
I'll<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
I'll do that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
I'll do that
okay<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> final<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.400> use

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
okay then for the final you will use

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
okay then for the final you will use
clip<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> plate<00:01:41.630> stick<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> clip<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
clip and the plate stick the clip on to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
clip and the plate stick the clip on to
the<00:01:43.649> plate<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.890> create<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:45.210> fin<00:01:45.710> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the plate to create the back fin and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.429 
the plate to create the back fin and
that<00:01:46.860> goes<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.220> behind<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> hope

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that goes right behind here so I hope

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.120 
that goes right behind here so I hope
