well<00:02:40.790> some<00:02:41.210> crafty<00:02:41.660> guys<00:02:41.840> down<00:02:42.260> over<00:02:42.530> at<00:02:42.620> XDA<00:02:42.740> i

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.000 
well some crafty guys down over at XDA i
think<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.420> figured<00:02:45.020> out<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.680> number

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
think they have figured out the number

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.030 
think they have figured out the number
of<00:02:46.130> nexus<00:02:46.520> 4<00:02:46.760> sold<00:02:47.150> globally<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.320> far<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.860> was

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
of nexus 4 sold globally so far this was

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460 
of nexus 4 sold globally so far this was
cracked<00:02:49.370> using<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> devices<00:02:50.270> imei<00:02:50.959> number

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
cracked using the devices imei number

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.670 
cracked using the devices imei number
and<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:52.040> shows<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.580> know<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.880> date<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
and it shows you know like date and a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040 
and it shows you know like date and a
bunch<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.950> other<00:02:55.130> little<00:02:55.790> tidbits<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.690> are

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
bunch of other little tidbits that are

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.440 
bunch of other little tidbits that are
kind<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.380> like<00:02:57.590> code<00:02:58.040> embedded<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.820> imei

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
kind of like code embedded in the imei

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.510 
kind of like code embedded in the imei
number<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.200> they<00:03:00.350> believe<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.950> nexus<00:03:01.250> 4

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
number so they believe that the nexus 4

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.480 
number so they believe that the nexus 4
has<00:03:01.700> unofficially<00:03:02.030> sold<00:03:02.750> 1<00:03:03.470> million<00:03:03.800> units
