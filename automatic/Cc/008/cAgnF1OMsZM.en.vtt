00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.980
 allow that the band 8 8 a 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.140
 middle level 8 tank it has one 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.419
 fast moving accurate cannon and high 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.169
 structure is his closest relative 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.060
 the panda 2 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.430
 he has one compared to this one 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.930
 weaker armor lower 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.430
 speed but a better one 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.239
 maneuverability and the better 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.190
 cannon of the band 878 cannon with one 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.620
 caliber of 8.8 cm 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.809
 this concerns the of the band 2 in the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.239
 Shot rather accuracy and a lot of time 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.660
 the breakdown point allows it 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.720
 easily opponents of stages 8 and 9 too 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 to damage 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.490
 the final rate of 8.7 shot per 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470
 minute with a damage of 240 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.489
 units your shot yield a harm 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.570
 per minute of 2000 88 units without 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 Consideration of the modules hurt that 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.780
 the opponents are already called 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.210
 The tower turns a little faster than 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.790
 The storm of the panda 2 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.270
 otherwise both identical comparable 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.470
 low mass and armor 120 mm 60 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.319
 laterally and behind 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.539
 the tower is seldom shot most of the time 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:20.149
 the opponents also draw the choice of 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.090
 immigration is the achilles heel for 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.639
 a level 8 tank is 80 mental 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 50 on the side and 40 in the way something 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.899
 little the inclination of the front panel 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.270
 is 55 degrees with a shot change 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.869
 the band can then only one to regulation 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.569
 to step 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.880
 It should be remembered that the 50 mm 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.069
 No angles should you have him 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.539
 possibly behind walls rock 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.939
 rubble and other obstacles 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.279
 hide and the front armor for 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.079
 all further the agility of the 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.270
 panthers 88 is for a medium 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.249
 Panzer bad though he is faster 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.380
 turns a sleepwalker 2 is the 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.779
 top speed only 46 kaymer 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.859
 Therefore, fast opponents should distance 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.630
 being held 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.549
 they will come too close to you 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.189
 orbiting without consideration 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.409
 it is not recommended with the 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.110
 panther 8 8 in the first rows or in the 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.280
 fight melee or fast frank 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.560
 to execute her maneuver 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 The machine is wonderful for second 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.610
 and third row suited the typical 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.349
 German accurate can without the allowed 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 Opponents to distance to the holes and 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.220
 the first places in the team in the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.220
 conclusion and damage pay to prove 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.250
 this support spencer is similar in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 the way he plays a brisk hunt 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.629
 Tank with tower he is looking for one 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.970
 Attack direction takes the position 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.400
 1 makes the melee better suited 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.959
 allied and harms the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.360
 first education 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.920
 the machine has enough 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.870
 speed around the flank too 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.849
 switch to the allies there too 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.190
 support 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.980
 in case you are discovered as he is 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.500
 sufficient structure like a real one 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 heavy armor sufficient around the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.440
 position to change the bands has no 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.090
 privileged balance which means 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.269
 that from time to time against the tens 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.060
 but it does not really work 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.040
 in the style of the game it is good 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.590
 ten to fifteen paper grenades 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.959
 to carry along especially for these cases and 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.209
 the previously in the usual tempo the 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.579
 show weak spots of the opponent 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.890
 If necessary, you can be a fat opponent 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.150
 on the chain under the five shot 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.459
 connects received 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.769
 There is also silver and experience 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.019
 it will not necessarily be a separate one 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.430
 Team for the band 88 needs it 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019
 is a premium machine without the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.239
 retraining teams German 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.889
 middle armor schools can if they 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.380
 but train an extra team 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.200
 Do you need the skills you need for 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.560
 hunting tank and heavy armor suitable 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.079
 are 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.209
 because then come six are first and foremost 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.829
 the ability to timely 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.630
 Hide is for this tank 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.880
 vital to the rest of the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.540
 Team repair reversed quickly 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.510
 to repair 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.819
 Next, you increase the visibility 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.310
 by commander by heavy and the 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.440
 bunker by far-sighted right-wing shooter 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.970
 Kill the sniper for extra 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.069
 hit effect for the rest 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.510
 crafts depending on taste as 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.790
 Third craft is from 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.609
 Citizenship good as a module recommend 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.220
 we the sniper collection 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.090
 Stabilizer makes the goal easier 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.250
 piecing paired with the ventilation 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.380
 the damage per minute to 2,400 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.690
 units if visibility is more important 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.490
 as loading time seems to set now 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.840
 ventilation through optics or telescope 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.820
 Consumers should be the standard 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.400
 repair goes verbandkasten and 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.630
 Fire extinguishers generally involve 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.580
 is there to shoot at distance 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.410
 instead of being in close combat 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.210
 the high accuracy shot and 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.550
 puncture allow the opponents to 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.050
 Great distance to annihilate battle 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.340
 output and much 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.150
 experience silver and medals 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.400
