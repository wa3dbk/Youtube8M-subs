00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of these guys get behind them so that I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469 
of these guys get behind them so that I
could<00:01:47.220> shoot<00:01:47.490> him<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:47.909> cuz<00:01:48.270> that's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
could shoot him in the back cuz that's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
could shoot him in the back cuz that's
the<00:01:48.540> easiest<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> kill<00:01:49.229> somebody<00:01:49.470> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
