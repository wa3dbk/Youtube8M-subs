the<00:00:30.779> liver<00:00:30.990> could<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.230> used<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> thickener

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the liver could be used as a thickener

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
the liver could be used as a thickener
we<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.640> something<00:00:32.820> else<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
we can just put it in something else it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
we can just put it in something else it
doesn't<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.170> used<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> dish

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
doesn't have to be used in this dish

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
doesn't have to be used in this dish
probably<00:00:35.700> better<00:00:36.540> without<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
probably better without it because it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
probably better without it because it
has<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> different<00:00:37.860> flavor<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.719> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
has a different flavor for the me and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.090 
has a different flavor for the me and
you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.079> bread<00:00:40.320> crumbs<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.739> thickening

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you can use bread crumbs or thickening

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.119 
you can use bread crumbs or thickening
anyway<00:00:41.430> which<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> do

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
anyway which is what I'm going to do

just separate the saddle from the top

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.729 
just separate the saddle from the top
half<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> joint<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> spinal<00:00:49.140> cord<00:00:49.320> but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
half so joint in the spinal cord but

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.299 
half so joint in the spinal cord but
you've<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> find<00:00:51.000> should<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> able<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.309> cut

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you've got to find should be able to cut

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
you've got to find should be able to cut
through<00:00:53.610> much<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.870> easily<00:00:55.110> lie<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
through much more easily lie of if you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.729 
through much more easily lie of if you
have<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> better<00:00:56.219> knife<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> thing

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
have a better knife for this thing

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.020 
have a better knife for this thing
that's<00:00:58.739> fine<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.160> myself<00:00:59.699> yeah<00:01:01.910> try<00:01:02.910> and
