third<00:03:11.310> /<00:03:11.640> glitches<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.510> handling<00:03:13.080> grow

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
third / glitches in the handling grow

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.949 
third / glitches in the handling grow
which<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> next<00:03:14.040> row<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
which is the next row down it is all the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.710 
which is the next row down it is all the
way<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.709> quick<00:03:17.550> draw<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.510> pretty

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
way to the right is quick draw so pretty

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.930 
way to the right is quick draw so pretty
much<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.079> makes<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.500> zoom<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.950> faster<00:03:20.489> so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
much this makes you zoom in faster so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.660 
much this makes you zoom in faster so
you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.209> actually<00:03:21.510> win<00:03:22.260> gunfights<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:23.070> people

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
you can actually win gunfights if people

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.289 
you can actually win gunfights if people
are<00:03:23.760> using<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.930> example<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:26.640> vector<00:03:27.090> a

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
are using for example the vector a

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.420 
are using for example the vector a
submachine<00:03:28.079> gun<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> upper<00:03:29.400> hand

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
submachine gun so you get the upper hand

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.090 
submachine gun so you get the upper hand
sort<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.360> rule<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> better<00:03:31.470> chance<00:03:31.890> of

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
sort of rule get a better chance of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.060 
sort of rule get a better chance of
killing<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.730> person<00:03:33.260> okay<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.410> fourth<00:03:34.739> perk

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
killing the person okay the fourth perk
