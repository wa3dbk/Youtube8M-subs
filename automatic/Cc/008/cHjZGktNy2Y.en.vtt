has got and I remember back in the day
when<00:00:40.710> i<00:00:40.980> first<00:00:41.250> started<00:00:41.640> racing<00:00:41.820> supermoto<00:00:42.510> ad

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
when i first started racing supermoto ad

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.110 
when i first started racing supermoto ad
Smith<00:00:43.500> used<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.949> blow<00:00:44.160> everybody<00:00:44.640> away<00:00:44.699> on<00:00:45.089> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
Smith used to blow everybody away on a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720 
Smith used to blow everybody away on a
380<00:00:45.600> KTM<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.769> I<00:00:46.800> thought<00:00:47.010> I've<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.609> one

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
380 KTM so I thought I've got to get one

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
380 KTM so I thought I've got to get one
of<00:00:47.879> those<00:00:47.999> so<00:00:48.929> yeah<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a complete basket case and I've just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.149 
a complete basket case and I've just
totally<00:00:55.980> renovated<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:56.999> restored<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.839> and

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
totally renovated it and restored it and

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.889 
totally renovated it and restored it and
put<00:00:59.159> all<00:00:59.190> modern<00:00:59.670> equipment<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.749> all

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

that and just basically it's been a bit
of<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.809> development<00:01:04.500> sort<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.860> project<00:01:05.630> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
of a development sort of project this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.770 
of a development sort of project this
year<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.560> oh<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.820> brilliant<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
year and and oh it's it's brilliant I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.900 
year and and oh it's it's brilliant I
love<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.800> said<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.040> development

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
love it so you said a development

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.510 
love it so you said a development
project<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.950> there's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
project so would you think this there's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
project so would you think this there's
room<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.060> specific<00:01:15.330> class<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.350> stroke

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
room for a specific class for two stroke

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.310 
room for a specific class for two stroke
within<00:01:17.040> supermoto<00:01:17.610> yeah<00:01:18.510> most<00:01:18.780> definitely<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
within supermoto yeah most definitely I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100 
within supermoto yeah most definitely I
mean<00:01:20.090> you've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> look<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.660> now<00:01:21.780> things

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
mean you've got to look at it now things

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
mean you've got to look at it now things
are<00:01:22.290> turning<00:01:22.730> full<00:01:23.730> circle<00:01:24.330> again<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.780> know

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
are turning full circle again you know

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.180 
are turning full circle again you know
you<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> motocross<00:01:25.920> world

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
you look in the motocross world

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.210 
you look in the motocross world
everybody's<00:01:26.880> two-stroke<00:01:27.570> crazy<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.010> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
everybody's two-stroke crazy and I just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
everybody's two-stroke crazy and I just
think<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.580> it's<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
think it's it's the way to go up you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.930 
think it's it's the way to go up you
know<00:01:31.440> even<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.800> we<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.400> two-stroke

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
know even if we just have a two-stroke

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.750 
know even if we just have a two-stroke
class<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.920> bikes<00:01:35.160> are<00:01:35.340> cheaper

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
class you know the bikes are cheaper

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.910 
class you know the bikes are cheaper
they're<00:01:36.150> cheaper<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> maintain<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.470> cheaper<00:01:37.800> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
they're cheaper to maintain a cheaper to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
they're cheaper to maintain a cheaper to
crash<00:01:38.190> their<00:01:38.490> cheaper<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.940> tires<00:01:39.240> they're

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
crash their cheaper on tires they're

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.930 
crash their cheaper on tires they're
cheaper<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> buy<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.760> it's

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
cheaper to buy and they're not it's

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.930 
cheaper to buy and they're not it's
noisy<00:01:42.090> either<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.440> know<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:44.580> they<00:01:44.760> just

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
noisy either you know and they just

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.510 
noisy either you know and they just
smell<00:01:45.210> great<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.690> well<00:01:45.720> well<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:47.160> know<00:01:47.310> what

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
smell great as well well as we know what

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.400 
smell great as well well as we know what
the<00:01:47.700> were<00:01:48.270> finding<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.810> difficult<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.260> noise

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
the were finding it difficult with noise

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.080 
the were finding it difficult with noise
issues<00:01:49.800> at<00:01:49.950> lots<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> circuits<00:01:50.730> now<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
issues at lots of circuits now and the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
issues at lots of circuits now and the
four<00:01:51.270> steps<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:52.350> quite<00:01:52.770> noisy<00:01:52.980> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
four steps are are quite noisy you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
four steps are are quite noisy you
mentioned<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> cost<00:01:54.510> effective<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
mentioned that the cost effective just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
mentioned that the cost effective just
