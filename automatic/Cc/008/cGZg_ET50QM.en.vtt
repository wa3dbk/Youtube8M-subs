i'm sorry you can't see the name because
it's<00:01:33.400> going<00:01:33.850> away<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:36.280> foundation<00:01:37.240> is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
it's going away and your foundation is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.510 
it's going away and your foundation is
going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.600> be<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.990> little<00:01:38.320> damp<00:01:38.710> or<00:01:38.950> maybe<00:01:39.159> tacky

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
going to be a little damp or maybe tacky

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.609 
going to be a little damp or maybe tacky
you<00:01:39.850> would<00:01:40.000> have<00:01:40.119> rut<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.690> want<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.960> put<00:01:41.590> on

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
you would have rut you want to put on

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.270 
you would have rut you want to put on
your<00:01:41.860> powder<00:01:42.130> until<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:43.180> thoroughly<00:01:44.280> coated

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
your powder until it's thoroughly coated

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.460 
your powder until it's thoroughly coated
I<00:01:45.670> guess<00:01:45.970> because<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:47.020> sets<00:01:47.290> your

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
I guess because that sets your

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.999 
I guess because that sets your
foundation<00:01:48.360> next<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.600> highlighting<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.830> can

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
foundation next is highlighting you can

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.100 
foundation next is highlighting you can
skip<00:01:51.369> these<00:01:51.549> steps<00:01:52.000> if<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.570> don't<00:01:52.780> feel<00:01:53.080> like

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
skip these steps if you don't feel like

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.870 
skip these steps if you don't feel like
it<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.560> want<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.979> just<00:01:54.130> go<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.640> powder

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
it you want to just go from the powder

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.450 
it you want to just go from the powder
but<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.930> highlighting<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.890> just<00:01:57.220> makes

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
but I do the highlighting it just makes

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.630 
but I do the highlighting it just makes
your<00:01:57.610> eyes<00:01:57.789> pop<00:01:59.039> so<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.100> put<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
your eyes pop so you put it in the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.790 
your eyes pop so you put it in the
