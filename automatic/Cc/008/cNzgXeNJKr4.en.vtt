00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.100
 the quality of videos that you upload to your 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.739
 page very good information that we 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.340
 they provide I would like you to help me 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.390
 with my problem 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 I am 21 years old, measuring one meter 75 and weighing 78 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 kilos or 172 pounds is very difficult for me 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 increase in size my legs and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 calves I train them only once 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.970
 for the week I have a good 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.670
 feeding based on high quantities 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.090
 of complex protein carbohydrates and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.550
 essential fats and consumption consumed a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 winner of the same weight as you had in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 your page after training my part 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.869
 higher if it grows very fast by the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 lower part almost not especially the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.740
 calves practically nothing for that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.750
 I stopped training back and that was 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 providing the symmetry in my body 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.210
 seeing me big above and small and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 weak from below I would like me to 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 they will orientate well what to do in advance 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 thank you very much good friends it seems that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 you are doing everything right you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.720
 I suggest you keep training legs a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.050
 once a week maybe even once 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.810
 for every ten days or three times per month 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.920
 try to train with high weights 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.590
 low repetitions 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.600
 try to do the least cardiovascular 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.240
 possible the cardiovascular has the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.450
 tendency to decrease the size and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.570
 also to reduce the size of the volume 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 of the muscle is about 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.920
 maybe do three or four exercises 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.880
 maximum for legs squats 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.070
 white after extension and calves 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.780
 also the femoral is very important not 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.580
 must train the femoral many people 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.649
 they do not understand it and that's why when 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.270
 they only understand the 4s and the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.340
 calf of the leg stops having 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.709
 the size and try to avoid 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.660
 cardiovascular most important because 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.760
 the cardiovascular as I reiterate you are going to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.880
 decrease the size of your leg treats 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.860
 of being less repetitions for more weight 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.989
 and try to train legs only 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.550
 three times a month give her legs 10 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.470
 rest days before training the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.690
 again that increase your size 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.910
 also try to use creatine monkey 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.459
 hydrated and it is not necessary to use 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.590
 anabolic but definitely use 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.060
 creatine and take at least 3 to 4 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 liters of water per day 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.799
 thank you very much thank you for your 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.410
 question I hope it is well forgive me if 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.180
 he repeated me a little but he's leading 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.720
 it was and it's very cold but some 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.819
