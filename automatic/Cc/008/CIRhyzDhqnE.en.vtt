of it there it goes it's actually turned
out<00:02:27.519> perfect

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
out perfect

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.259 
out perfect
so<00:02:29.079> if<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.230> notice<00:02:29.459> yellow<00:02:30.459> fill<00:02:30.819> line<00:02:31.030> down

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
so if you notice yellow fill line down

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:40.649 
so if you notice yellow fill line down
there<00:02:32.159> cap<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.370> off<00:02:39.120> I'm<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.329> do<00:02:40.420> next

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
there cap that off I'm going to do next

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.740 
there cap that off I'm going to do next
I<00:02:40.900> must<00:02:41.049> start<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.409> car<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.250> kind<00:02:42.489> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
I must start the car and just kind of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
I must start the car and just kind of
wait<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> few<00:02:44.079> seconds<00:02:44.650> pump<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.189> brakes<00:02:45.519> and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
wait a few seconds pump the brakes and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.379 
wait a few seconds pump the brakes and
hopefully<00:02:46.120> those<00:02:46.359> lights<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:47.200> off<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:52.269> right

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
hopefully those lights go off all right

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:59.390 
hopefully those lights go off all right
let's<00:02:52.599> take<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.810> look

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.530 

and<00:02:59.670> they<00:03:00.090> did<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.580> what<00:03:02.580> ended<00:03:02.879> up<00:03:03.000> being<00:03:03.060> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and they did so what ended up being is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.589 
and they did so what ended up being is
your<00:03:04.530> brake<00:03:05.340> system<00:03:05.790> detected<00:03:07.550> low<00:03:08.599> brake

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
your brake system detected low brake
