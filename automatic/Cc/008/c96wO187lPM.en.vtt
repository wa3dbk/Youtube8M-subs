00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
doing I can just copy and or type down
the<00:01:22.920> code<00:01:23.130> yourself<00:01:26.180> basically<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.479> saying

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the code yourself basically I'm saying

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
the code yourself basically I'm saying
is<00:01:28.460> wow<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.000> no<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.539> links<00:01:30.840> left<00:01:32.509> or

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and let's create actually let's create a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:08.850 
and let's create actually let's create a
queue<00:01:54.950> or<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.980> list<00:01:56.580> list<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.330> better

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.190 

one<00:02:09.580> two<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.320> this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.650 
add link alright and then we want to
source<00:02:22.650> code<00:02:22.920> equals<00:02:24.140> source<00:02:25.140> code<00:02:25.410> out<00:02:25.620> place

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
source code equals source code out place

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:46.679 
source code equals source code out place
we<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> replace

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689

got to get rid of all the previous links
by<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.299> erasing<00:02:50.930> them<00:02:51.079> pretty<00:02:51.319> much

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.180 

place<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:03.930> nothing<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.860> should

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
place that with just nothing this should

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.610 
place that with just nothing this should
get<00:03:05.370> rid<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.580> it

okay all right now so what we did is we

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.850 
okay all right now so what we did is we
got<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.740> index<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.700> file<00:03:15.410> we<00:03:16.410> got<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
got the index of the file we got the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.300 
got the index of the file we got the
actual<00:03:17.160> file<00:03:17.430> added<00:03:17.820> mp3<00:03:18.420> onto<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
actual file added mp3 onto it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.600 
actual file added mp3 onto it
then<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.430> added<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.970> URL<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.680> file<00:03:22.920> name

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
then we added the URL to the file name

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.000 
then we added the URL to the file name
to<00:03:24.420> get<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> full<00:03:24.900> link<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.650> added<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
to get the full link and we added the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.660 
to get the full link and we added the
fowling<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.520> list<00:03:26.730> then<00:03:27.300> we<00:03:27.660> erased<00:03:28.490> list<00:03:29.490> so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
fowling to a list then we erased list so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.130 
fowling to a list then we erased list so
we<00:03:29.790> pretty<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.180> say<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.600> got<00:03:30.870> this

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
we pretty much say we got this

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.340 
we pretty much say we got this
completely<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.580> then<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:32.820> basically<00:03:33.120> just

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
completely and then we basically just

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
completely and then we basically just
deleted<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.490> next<00:03:35.670> time<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:35.970> get<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
deleted it so the next time we get the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.150 
deleted it so the next time we get the
index<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.810> href<00:03:37.200> it'll<00:03:37.560> go<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:37.950> one

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
index of a href it'll go to this one

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
index of a href it'll go to this one
instead<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.030> staying<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.260> going

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
instead of staying on this one and going

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.880 
instead of staying on this one and going
over<00:03:40.620> again<00:03:40.860> again<00:03:41.250> again<00:03:41.370> again<00:03:42.770> all<00:03:43.770> right

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
over again again again again all right

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.840 
over again again again again all right
