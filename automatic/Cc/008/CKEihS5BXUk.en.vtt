00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
warfarin I probably will really enjoy

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.049 
warfarin I probably will really enjoy
playing<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.600> multiplayer<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:44.730> gotta

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
playing the multiplayer but I just gotta

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.740 
playing the multiplayer but I just gotta
keep<00:00:45.329> thinking<00:00:45.899> where<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.750> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
keep thinking where is this going and I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.680 
keep thinking where is this going and I
have<00:00:49.739> real<00:00:50.070> hope<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.700> tryouts<00:00:51.000> next<00:00:51.239> game

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have real hope in tryouts next game

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
have real hope in tryouts next game
because<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:54.530> think<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> be

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
because I think that it's going to be

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
because I think that it's going to be
very<00:00:57.270> very<00:00:57.629> different<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.379> anything<00:00:58.649> we've

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
very very different from anything we've

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
very very different from anything we've
seen<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.520> got<00:01:00.239> quite<00:01:00.719> involved<00:01:01.640> not<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
seen I got quite involved not like it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
seen I got quite involved not like it
enters<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> company's<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.619> involved

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
enters the company's but I got involved

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
enters the company's but I got involved
in<00:01:05.129> playing<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> strike<00:01:06.240> team<00:01:06.540> app<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
in playing with the strike team app that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
in playing with the strike team app that
came<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.100> crap<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.810> was

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
came out was crap by the way but it was

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
came out was crap by the way but it was
a<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.110> different<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> felt<00:01:11.159> weird<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a bit different it felt weird like it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
a bit different it felt weird like it
didn't<00:01:12.479> feel<00:01:12.750> quite<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.380> call<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> duty<00:01:13.920> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
didn't feel quite like call of duty but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
didn't feel quite like call of duty but
it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.220> interesting<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> same<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it was interesting in the same way and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
it was interesting in the same way and
of<00:01:15.900> course<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.350> only<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> iOS<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of course it was only on iOS I think so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
of course it was only on iOS I think so
it<00:01:17.700> wasn't<00:01:17.970> quite<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:19.140> real<00:01:19.530> step<00:01:19.890> forward<00:01:19.950> or

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it wasn't quite a real step forward or

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
it wasn't quite a real step forward or
anything<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
anything but it was different and it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
anything but it was different and it
felt<00:01:23.040> fresh<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.509> convinced<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
felt fresh I'm not convinced that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.880 
felt fresh I'm not convinced that
advanced<00:01:25.470> warfare<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.310> gonna<00:01:26.640> feel<00:01:26.909> fresh

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
advanced warfare is gonna feel fresh

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890 
advanced warfare is gonna feel fresh
I'll<00:01:28.890> play<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.189> I'll<00:01:29.880> play<00:01:30.119> co-op<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> I'll

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I'll play it I'll play co-op and I'll

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
I'll play it I'll play co-op and I'll
play<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.890> might<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.310> play<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
play probably might even play the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.740 
play probably might even play the
campaign<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.799> away<00:01:35.159> those

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
campaign but if you take away those

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.819 
campaign but if you take away those
exoskeletons<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> some<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> kind<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
exoskeletons and some of the kind of

exoskeletons and some of the kind of
high-tech<00:01:38.070> II<00:01:38.490> stuff<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> jumping

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
high-tech II stuff you know the jumping

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
high-tech II stuff you know the jumping
ability<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.650> stupid<00:01:40.979> stuff<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.490> not

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ability the kind of stupid stuff I'm not

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.710 
ability the kind of stupid stuff I'm not
convinced<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.500> anything<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:45.600> we

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
convinced that it's anything that we

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.929 
convinced that it's anything that we
haven't<00:01:45.899> seen<00:01:46.079> before<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> seems<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> be

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
haven't seen before and it seems to be

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
haven't seen before and it seems to be
that<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> sins<00:01:49.110> called<00:01:49.500> for

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that this kind of sins called for

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.130 
that this kind of sins called for
obviously<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> underlying<00:01:51.270> architecture<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
obviously the underlying architecture is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
obviously the underlying architecture is
there<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.619> always<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.579> fierce

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
there it's always gonna be in a fierce

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.570 
there it's always gonna be in a fierce
game<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.360> shooting<00:01:54.750> other<00:01:54.840> people
