the big fallacies of of wealth and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.889 
the big fallacies of of wealth and
development<00:00:41.649> is<00:00:42.489> called<00:00:42.789> a<00:00:43.059> zero<00:00:43.329> sum<00:00:43.839> game

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
development is called a zero sum game

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.219 
development is called a zero sum game
fallacy<00:00:44.889> and<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.609> is<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:46.389> supposition<00:00:46.719> that

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
fallacy and that is the supposition that

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.069 
fallacy and that is the supposition that
wealth<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.249> like<00:00:48.429> some<00:00:48.670> kind<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.940> giant<00:00:49.539> pie

fixed<00:00:51.069> amount<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:52.030> if<00:00:52.329> you<00:00:52.600> could<00:00:53.469> have

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
fixed amount of it so if you could have

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.860 
fixed amount of it so if you could have
a<00:00:53.679> larger<00:00:54.249> slice<00:00:54.519> of<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.909> someone<00:00:55.600> can<00:00:55.780> may

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
a larger slice of it someone can may

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
a larger slice of it someone can may
have<00:00:56.019> to<00:00:56.170> make<00:00:56.350> do<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:56.589> less

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

Ron<00:00:58.329> answer<00:00:58.929> what<00:00:59.229> actually<00:00:59.409> happens<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.670> that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
Ron answer what actually happens is that

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.939 
Ron answer what actually happens is that
wealth<00:01:01.119> is<00:01:01.299> created<00:01:01.539> by<00:01:02.170> trade<00:01:02.469> you<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.799> don't

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
wealth is created by trade you you don't

to encourage development but I could sum
it<00:01:38.680> up<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.100> chapter<00:01:39.340> indeed<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.060> got<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.330> down

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
it up in a chapter indeed I got it down

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.640 
it up in a chapter indeed I got it down
to<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.750> page<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.410> then<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.220> paragraph<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:43.120> fact

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
to a page and then a paragraph in fact

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.590 
to a page and then a paragraph in fact
there's<00:01:44.650> only<00:01:44.740> three<00:01:45.070> words<00:01:45.600> by

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
there's only three words by
