00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
architecture you see this is for

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
architecture you see this is for
instance<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.960> silhouette<00:00:25.380> shape<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
instance a silhouette shape that is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.630 
instance a silhouette shape that is
always<00:00:26.910> oriented<00:00:27.480> towards<00:00:27.990> us<00:00:28.109> when<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> tilts

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
always oriented towards us when it tilts

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.069 
always oriented towards us when it tilts
in<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.779> axis<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.980> turn<00:00:32.730> around<00:00:33.079> he's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
in this axis but it can turn around he's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
in this axis but it can turn around he's
always<00:00:34.290> facing<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.270> ok<00:00:36.320> let's<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:38.360> want

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
and by the golden card rule it should be

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.950 
and by the golden card rule it should be
2.4<00:05:27.480> meters<00:05:28.380> long<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.450> want<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.510> see<00:05:30.750> how<00:05:30.900> it

2.4 meters long I want to see how it

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.840 
2.4 meters long I want to see how it
lives<00:05:31.200> it's<00:05:31.650> two<00:05:31.770> point<00:05:32.040> four<00:05:32.400> point<00:05:32.460> one

there I want another one ok import an

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.460 
there I want another one ok import an
object<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.660> we<00:06:01.990> take<00:06:03.900> so<00:06:04.900> let's<00:06:05.080> plays<00:06:05.320> in

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
object and we take so let's plays in

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.760 
object and we take so let's plays in
here<00:06:05.970> good<00:06:07.230> so<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:10.080> our<00:06:11.080> window<00:06:11.500> if<00:06:11.560> this

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
here good so this is our window if this

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.080 
here good so this is our window if this
sword<00:06:12.070> looks<00:06:13.080> pretty<00:06:14.080> cool<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:15.490> now<00:06:15.700> let's

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
sword looks pretty cool so now let's

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.130 
sword looks pretty cool so now let's
make<00:06:16.600> it<00:06:16.660> a<00:06:17.080> bit<00:06:17.290> narrow<00:06:17.650> because<00:06:18.010> you<00:06:18.280> want<00:06:18.550> it

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
make it a bit narrow because you want it

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.370 
make it a bit narrow because you want it
yep<00:06:20.730> so<00:06:21.730> a<00:06:21.970> narrow<00:06:22.450> window<00:06:22.690> should<00:06:23.110> buy<00:06:23.320> the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
yep so a narrow window should buy the

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.610 
yep so a narrow window should buy the
golden<00:06:24.010> cards<00:06:24.250> rule<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:25.290> think<00:06:26.290> you're<00:06:26.380> 90

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
golden cards rule I think you're 90

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.390 
golden cards rule I think you're 90
centimeters<00:06:27.100> how<00:06:27.280> long<00:06:27.430> is<00:06:27.550> it<00:06:28.950> yeah<00:06:29.950> 90

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
centimeters how long is it yeah 90

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.640 
centimeters how long is it yeah 90
centimeters<00:06:30.820> long<00:06:30.970> so<00:06:31.270> we<00:06:31.450> have<00:06:31.720> to<00:06:32.020> point<00:06:32.260> for

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
centimeters long so we have to point for

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:41.760 
centimeters long so we have to point for
the<00:06:33.490> difference<00:06:34.000> is<00:06:36.780> point<00:06:37.780> for<00:06:38.160> 1.5<00:06:39.390> ok<00:06:40.770> so

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
the difference is point for 1.5 ok so

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.909 
the difference is point for 1.5 ok so
this<00:06:42.070> is<00:06:45.810> how<00:06:46.810> I<00:06:46.840> never<00:06:47.200> a<00:06:47.260> window<00:06:47.590> should<00:06:47.710> look

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
this is how I never a window should look

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.440 
this is how I never a window should look
like<00:06:48.300> hmm<00:06:49.300> that's<00:06:49.720> very<00:06:49.900> narrow<00:06:51.300> ok<00:06:52.300> we<00:06:52.419> can

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
like hmm that's very narrow ok we can

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.010 
like hmm that's very narrow ok we can
close<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.020> window<00:06:53.290> again<00:06:53.410> even<00:06:56.250> let's<00:06:57.250> just

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
close the window again even let's just

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.659 
close the window again even let's just
pull<00:06:59.020> down<00:07:00.540> there<00:07:01.540> is<00:07:01.630> much<00:07:02.040> ok<00:07:03.040> remove<00:07:03.490> the

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
pull down there is much ok remove the

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.920 
pull down there is much ok remove the
guidelines<00:07:04.060> oh<00:07:04.950> gosh<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.070> wall<00:07:06.250> that<00:07:06.810> was<00:07:07.810> the

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
guidelines oh gosh the wall that was the

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
guidelines oh gosh the wall that was the
line<00:07:08.080> ok<00:07:09.720> so<00:07:10.720> and<00:07:11.260> now<00:07:11.830> let's<00:07:12.100> just<00:07:12.400> add<00:07:12.610> a<00:07:12.640> door

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 
line ok so and now let's just add a door

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.640 
line ok so and now let's just add a door
we<00:07:14.950> take<00:07:15.250> a<00:07:15.280> rectangle<00:07:15.850> again<00:07:16.229> so<00:07:17.229> and<00:07:17.530> the

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
we take a rectangle again so and the

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.980 
we take a rectangle again so and the
door<00:07:17.770> shall<00:07:18.100> be<00:07:19.530> 1<00:07:20.530> meter<00:07:20.710> wide<00:07:21.690> 2.1<00:07:22.690> widget

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
door shall be 1 meter wide 2.1 widget

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:30.900 
door shall be 1 meter wide 2.1 widget
pie<00:07:23.440> and<00:07:24.300> put<00:07:25.300> it<00:07:25.419> on<00:07:25.540> again<00:07:27.570> maybe<00:07:28.570> I'll<00:07:29.100> ok

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
pie and put it on again maybe I'll ok

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.310 
pie and put it on again maybe I'll ok
so<00:07:32.220> that<00:07:33.220> are<00:07:33.490> some<00:07:34.030> very<00:07:34.300> very<00:07:34.570> basic<00:07:35.050> steps

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.320 
so that are some very very basic steps

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.460 
so that are some very very basic steps
you<00:07:35.500> can<00:07:35.530> do<00:07:35.770> with<00:07:36.040> Google<00:07:37.000> Sketchup<00:07:37.470> I've

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470 
you can do with Google Sketchup I've

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.490 
you can do with Google Sketchup I've
done<00:07:38.830> more<00:07:39.040> complex<00:07:39.520> things<00:07:39.660> as<00:07:40.660> you<00:07:40.900> may<00:07:41.470> have

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
done more complex things as you may have

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.400 
done more complex things as you may have
already<00:07:41.710> seen<00:07:42.100> another<00:07:42.310> video<00:07:42.640> so<00:07:42.730> I<00:07:42.820> get

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.410 
already seen another video so I get

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.560 
already seen another video so I get
called<00:07:44.410> the<00:07:44.560> point<00:07:44.980> cell<00:07:45.190> architecture<00:07:45.570> ok

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.570 
called the point cell architecture ok

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.290 
called the point cell architecture ok
that's<00:07:46.840> it<00:07:46.990> for<00:07:47.020> today<00:07:47.350> on<00:07:47.760> yeah<00:07:48.760> try<00:07:49.090> it<00:07:49.120> out

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300 
that's it for today on yeah try it out

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.730 
that's it for today on yeah try it out

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.350 
interested in architecture is something

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.200 
interested in architecture is something
or<00:07:53.500> just<00:07:53.560> want<00:07:53.890> to<00:07:53.920> decorate<00:07:54.130> your<00:07:54.550> home<00:07:54.910> menu
