00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.800
I was born in Cascavel, Parana, in Brazil.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.800
When I come home I feel a great sense of relief. It's like... "I'm home again."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500
Every time I come home... Man, it's something that I can't really explain.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800
My relationship with my parents is really great.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
My family works really really hard to pay for the house and everything, you know?

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.000
And yea, whenever I can, I help them financially because it's tough.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800
My family always comes first. A lot of people ask me, "Neguin, do you think about your future?"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.800
I say, "I do, of course I think about my future." But first of all, I want to help who helped me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.800
This trip is especially meaningful to me, because I am finally going to visit my brother's grave.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.200
But right now I am just really excited to see my family.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.200
When he comes back, I'm so happy... I start feeling excited 2 days before he arrives.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.700
After the big guy up above, he's everything to me. After God, it's Neguin.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.800
Mum! I am back!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
My son! How are you?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.800
I'm fine, mom.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.200
Are you eating well?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.800
Yes, and how is everyone at home?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.900
Yes, they're all well.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.800
Let's go inside then.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.800
How is it going kids?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.800
Uncle!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800
How are you all?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.800
Wow, look at your hair Marina, it's got so long!

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.800
What about these cool trainers, are they new? Wow, look at those.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.800
Give me the ball, let's play.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.300
Go on, Marina. Let's see if you can get it in.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.200
It has to be from here, this is the spot. Go on, throw it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Terrible, your turn. Nearly.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Who is going to get it in? I'll give 1 dollar to whoever does it.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.000
That's enough for now. Let's go have lunch. You guys have school, right? Let's go then, we'll play more later.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
My family was always there to support me. My parents, my brothers, everyone.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.000
Ever since I was a kid they encouraged me to do lots of good things.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.500
My sister was more like a mother to me. She was the one I talked with the most, who always helped me.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.200
I had a brother but he passed away last year. He was like a father to me not just a brother.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.800
He taught me the differences between right and wrong.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.800
He'd say you shouldn't do this, you should do this. He was a big role model for me. It all happened so quickly.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You never think it will happen but after it does it serves as an example. You think "whoa.." But that's life.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.500
Being back here makes me think about when I was a kid, playing with my brother.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.200
I miss him.
