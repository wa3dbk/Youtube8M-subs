00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello, how are you dressed? 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.319
 to get how to download and play 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 super smash bros for our android 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.730
 well for that we're going to need the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.730
 mega 64 emulator that you will find 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 directly on the google play it would be 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.580
 this one here and we could install it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.580
 totally free 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.330
 as you see it weighs only 12 58 megabytes and 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 now what we would need would be the rom 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.640
 of the game 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 because for that I'm going to leave you a link in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
 the description that will take you to the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 mediafire page and you are going to give it here 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 where it says in download here we go to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.370
 choose with internet and it would be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 downloading the rom now only us 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 would wait until the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.530
 rom good once you are already created the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.980
 rom then let's open the application of the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.980
 emulator 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.719
 The first time we open it, it goes away 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.530
 to take a little longer to create 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:07.960
 all the files to be able to have a 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.960
 better emulation and better gameplay 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.150
 and here we are going to give a game and say 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.159
 let's find the place where 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.840
 we have left the game rom 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.550
 how do we download it directly from 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 our android is going to save in 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 the download folder hondÃ³n lo agua 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.130
 here we are going to select super smash 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.710
 bros and we will give you to start 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.540
 emulation we could ask the chips 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 and give this part of here 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.200
 good and with that we could play at 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.120
 super smash bros on our android 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.840
