00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.790
 this week he talking about henrique is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 a map application for iphone and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 android that has been quite successful 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.799
 in the world among drivers including 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.560
 Here in Brazil 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 the legal system that allows you to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.820
 alerts while you're on the way 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 to let you know where traffic is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 an accident where there is a radar and this has 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 conquered has done is to conquer 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 A lot of users here in Brazil I'm 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.450
 here with karina pap who is a reporter for 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.149
 link and she talked to one of the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.950
 elise carol founders that you can 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.280
 the application it has to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280
 cool 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:52.770
 so the paul gave essentially to the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.379
 inter alia he was aware of traffic 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 And then you'll see my red or 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.910
 union is slow and applications 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.480
 quickly we want a return to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 past 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.229
 he can indicate the alternatives that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.930
 It's for you to escape the traffic where you have a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.930
 blocking and whether based on 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.680
 It was really cool and I saw this reference is and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.979
 that the application in 2008 will 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.110
 19 fire nor did they throw away it 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.240
 To say that I always have the habit of calling 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.880
 the friend asking how I paid for it 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.890
 road when you have a driver 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.700
 my front and know to cut the traffic 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.759
 slow down of gas and information will be 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.579
 with people here in 2009 nor their 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.500
 globally and officially here in 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.080
 Brazil in June of that year but I had 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.630
 400,000 users not even taking into 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 Portuguese and now I 'm already cool, nice. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.069
 the tatiana de mello days is of the whole 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 the west of the link and she used 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.569
 first time one and made a commute is 23 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.159
 miles here in São Paulo tatit que 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.099
 Did you think I was playing? 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.409
 skeptical because I'm a super google fan 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.479
 maps 500 places 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.940
 and then when I came in I put it on the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.470
 mobile phone and the first route 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.660
 would do in the east 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.130
 thinking of getting the world's traffic 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 marginal right 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.170
 and then I went on the google apps phone on 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.299
 hand and with it on the cell phone in the other hand 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.579
 comparing the routes initially 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.440
 Do you confirm me on Google, and then I 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.239
 I noticed that the 01 is a bit more 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.549
 smart and much faster 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.709
 marginal dogma I was looking at the icons 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.269
 appeared on a camera looks at us 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.430
 This camera clicked love, you want to shoot. 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.730
 all the radars of the marginal all 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.489
 tagged by other users or more to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.560
 front in the east radial there was a cart 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.530
 a symbol on one side of the map and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.420
 clicked for this is an accident is 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.940
 imported two hours the cold is possible 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.980
 as the case came close to the deal 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.920
 that actually had about 12 vehicles 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.099
 police to Haiti before the accident 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.139
 I think it's cooler, right at the beginning. 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.500
 when you put it in navigation mode 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.690
 to indicate the path and question you are 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.310
 the passenger if you are you can 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.380
 Continue 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.730
 if you are a driver you can not 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.950
 so you can not type in it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.690
 then who is guaranteeing the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.760
 safety of drivers 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.610
 along the way also a method of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.130
 Reporting is something you've seen 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.200
 the traffic accident or the traffic light 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.880
 broken as a goal is very simple 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.890
 22 clicks 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.349
 the business already report so I think the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.120
 their idea is to leave a system well 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.800
 fast and safe for the driver 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.140
 click and already report that there is 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.099
 injury or other motorists become 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.130
 Danger 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.080
 I thought it was cool, very fast, no. 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.850
 I know if I'm going to change I need to test him more 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.860
 a day to day me but I think they are 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.260
 excellent but still are paulo 23 um 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.480
 little more human here in são paulo is 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.220
 one thing the man said is that it's a 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.680
 of the disease founders that I found 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 better that it is an application only for 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.030
 drivers I think that who uses 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.510
 public transport or who walks the walk such 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.450
 it is not a seal the goal is not the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.730
 best option and also a thing 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.849
 interesting that was the new version 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.549
 released at the end of October that 3.5 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.489
 What's novelty is you can share 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.840
 your journey with other people 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.940
 including people who do not have the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.280
 For example, you have 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.200
 to meet a person who 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.640
 ensures that looking 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.060
 s or by facebook the first and the person sees 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.920
 a palace that your drive along 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.810
 And you can know the time to get a 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.540
 person to another 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.700
 also the creation of facebook that the work 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.500
 now also no legal help 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.950
 the full report you see in the link 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.120
 this week talking about every analysis 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.720
 explaining how it works 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.720
 app
