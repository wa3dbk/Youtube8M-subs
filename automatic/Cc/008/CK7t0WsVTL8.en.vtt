video and I figured you know I think
it's<00:00:08.429> worth<00:00:08.610> doing<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:09.300> isn't<00:00:10.050> anything<00:00:10.620> fancy

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
it's worth doing it isn't anything fancy

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's worth doing it isn't anything fancy
or<00:00:11.580> really<00:00:12.210> substantial<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> doesn't<00:00:13.440> change

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
or really substantial it doesn't change

gives off this little bit of a glow of
course<00:00:44.640> these<00:00:44.940> cartridges<00:00:45.329> need<00:00:45.750> power<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
course these cartridges need power in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
course these cartridges need power in
order<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> work<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> power

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
order to work and they get that power

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
order to work and they get that power
from<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.989> Game<00:00:49.170> Boy<00:00:49.320> Color<00:00:49.559> itself<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.120> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
from the Game Boy Color itself so we can

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
from the Game Boy Color itself so we can
tap<00:00:51.600> into<00:00:51.809> some<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> circuitry<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.920> the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
problems when I stuck the LED on it so

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.340 
problems when I stuck the LED on it so
that's<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.150> power<00:03:37.299> point<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.750> I'm<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.320> to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
that's the power point that I'm going to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.949 
that's the power point that I'm going to
use<00:03:38.440> going<00:03:38.890> forward<00:03:39.340> here<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:40.510> if<00:03:40.690> you've<00:03:40.840> got

they will be a bit brighter but the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.520 
they will be a bit brighter but the

necessarily<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.670> good<00:04:07.000> thing<00:04:07.329> so<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.079> need<00:04:08.230> to

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
necessarily a good thing so we need to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
we don't burn it out the easiest way is

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.800 
we don't burn it out the easiest way is
to<00:04:17.049> stick<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> resistor<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.340> line<00:04:18.729> with<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.359> LED

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810

shrink<00:04:54.780> tubing<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.620> keep<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.920> from<00:04:56.100> shorting

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
shrink tubing to keep it from shorting

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.490 
shrink tubing to keep it from shorting
anything<00:04:56.940> out<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.930> once<00:04:58.140> you've<00:04:58.290> gotten

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
anything out so once you've gotten

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.920 
anything out so once you've gotten
everything<00:04:58.800> soldered<00:04:59.520> together<00:04:59.700> test<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.780> one

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
everything soldered together test it one

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.510 
everything soldered together test it one
more<00:05:01.170> time<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.770> make<00:05:01.980> sure<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.400> all

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
more time just make sure that it all

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.670 
more time just make sure that it all
works<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.090> then<00:05:03.600> button<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.050> up<00:05:04.200> what's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
works and then button it up what's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.530 
works and then button it up what's
interesting<00:05:05.070> is<00:05:05.730> that<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.210> don't<00:05:06.390> really

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
interesting is that you don't really

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.870 
interesting is that you don't really
need<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.930> hold<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.350> LED<00:05:07.800> down<00:05:08.040> inside<00:05:08.700> the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
need to hold the LED down inside the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.370 
need to hold the LED down inside the
case<00:05:09.120> or<00:05:09.360> anything<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.780> don't<00:05:09.900> need<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.200> use

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
case or anything you don't need to use

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.920 
case or anything you don't need to use
hot<00:05:11.160> glue<00:05:11.490> or<00:05:11.520> electrical<00:05:12.390> tape<00:05:12.570> or<00:05:12.750> anything

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
hot glue or electrical tape or anything

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.420 
hot glue or electrical tape or anything
it's<00:05:13.260> not<00:05:13.350> going<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.650> go<00:05:13.800> anywhere<00:05:14.070> because

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
it's not going to go anywhere because

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.730 
it's not going to go anywhere because
it's<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.970> very<00:05:15.180> tight<00:05:15.450> fit<00:05:15.780> inside<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.470> case

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
it's a very tight fit inside that case

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.370 
it's a very tight fit inside that case
once<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.669> get<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.000> top<00:05:18.240> cover<00:05:18.570> put<00:05:18.870> back<00:05:19.110> on

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
once you get the top cover put back on

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.190 
once you get the top cover put back on
it<00:05:19.800> holds<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.340> LED<00:05:20.850> down<00:05:21.090> firm<00:05:21.540> against<00:05:22.080> that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
it holds the LED down firm against that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.840 
it holds the LED down firm against that
circuit<00:05:22.620> board<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:23.040> it's<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.370> going<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.669> go

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
circuit board so it's not going to go

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.970 
circuit board so it's not going to go
anywhere<00:05:24.090> there's<00:05:24.990> actually<00:05:25.470> very<00:05:25.680> little

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
anywhere there's actually very little

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.159 
anywhere there's actually very little
room<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.520> an<00:05:26.610> LED<00:05:26.850> just<00:05:27.480> happens<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:28.020> fit

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
room and an LED just happens to fit

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.100 
room and an LED just happens to fit
perfectly<00:05:28.790> now<00:05:29.790> what<00:05:30.480> I<00:05:30.510> do<00:05:30.630> this<00:05:30.900> might<00:05:31.080> a

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
perfectly now what I do this might a

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.900 
perfectly now what I do this might a
little<00:05:31.410> bit<00:05:31.530> differently<00:05:31.919> again<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.580> second

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
little bit differently again the second

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.390 
little bit differently again the second
time<00:05:32.940> probably<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.960> used<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.440> white<00:05:34.680> LED<00:05:35.190> this

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
time probably I used a white LED this

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.650 
time probably I used a white LED this
time<00:05:35.640> because<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.030> thought<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.360> would<00:05:36.480> look

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
time because I thought it would look

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.990 
time because I thought it would look
cool<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.169> problem<00:05:37.530> is<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.860> used<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.280> directional

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
cool the problem is I used a directional

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.870 
cool the problem is I used a directional
LED<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:40.050> may<00:05:40.200> want<00:05:40.410> to<00:05:40.470> get<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.650> diffuse<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.490> LED

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
LED you may want to get a diffuse to LED

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.880 
LED you may want to get a diffuse to LED
if<00:05:42.120> you're<00:05:42.330> going<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.510> actually<00:05:42.660> go<00:05:42.990> by<00:05:43.290> LEDs

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
if you're going to actually go by LEDs

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.040 
if you're going to actually go by LEDs
to<00:05:44.160> do<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:44.490> mod<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:45.390> way<00:05:45.540> you'll<00:05:45.720> get<00:05:45.900> kind

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
to do this mod that way you'll get kind

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.560 
to do this mod that way you'll get kind
of<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.260> nice<00:05:46.410> all-around<00:05:47.160> glow<00:05:47.669> it'll<00:05:48.270> look<00:05:48.450> a

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
of a nice all-around glow it'll look a

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.750 
of a nice all-around glow it'll look a
lot<00:05:48.600> better<00:05:49.110> it'll<00:05:49.680> look<00:05:49.770> more<00:05:50.010> diffused<00:05:50.520> and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
lot better it'll look more diffused and

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.300 
lot better it'll look more diffused and
without<00:05:51.180> any<00:05:51.390> hot<00:05:51.660> spots<00:05:51.900> or<00:05:52.410> making<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.190> look

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
without any hot spots or making it look

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.010 
without any hot spots or making it look
like<00:05:53.550> you've<00:05:53.790> turned<00:05:54.150> your<00:05:54.270> Gameboy<00:05:54.720> into<00:05:54.960> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
like you've turned your Gameboy into a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.680 
like you've turned your Gameboy into a
flashlight<00:05:55.350> or<00:05:55.680> something<00:05:56.160> like<00:05:56.280> that

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
flashlight or something like that

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.659 
flashlight or something like that
but<00:05:57.690> anyway<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.470> very<00:05:58.530> simple<00:05:59.340> easy

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
but anyway this is a very simple easy

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.360 
but anyway this is a very simple easy
and<00:06:00.150> cheap<00:06:00.180> mod<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.870> do<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.710> can<00:06:02.010> get<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.220> little

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
and cheap mod to do it can get a little

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.250 
and cheap mod to do it can get a little
finicky<00:06:02.729> at<00:06:02.940> times<00:06:03.240> with<00:06:03.690> trying<00:06:04.050> to<00:06:04.080> keep

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
finicky at times with trying to keep

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260 
finicky at times with trying to keep
from<00:06:04.320> shorting<00:06:04.830> anything<00:06:05.220> out<00:06:05.370> but<00:06:05.940> you<00:06:06.120> know

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
from shorting anything out but you know

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.380 
from shorting anything out but you know
what<00:06:06.510> take<00:06:06.750> your<00:06:06.810> time<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.410> you<00:06:07.710> can<00:06:07.919> do<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.390> if

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
what take your time and you can do it if

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.120 
what take your time and you can do it if
you<00:06:09.600> liked<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.020> video<00:06:10.110> I<00:06:10.320> would<00:06:10.710> appreciate<00:06:10.919> a
