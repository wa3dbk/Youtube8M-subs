00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
left if you look to the right you'll see

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.060 
left if you look to the right you'll see
it's<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.560> dead<00:04:10.770> end

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
it's a dead end

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.770 
it's a dead end
so<00:04:11.640> we've<00:04:11.820> got<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.090> go<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.390> left<00:04:14.720> now<00:04:15.720> we
