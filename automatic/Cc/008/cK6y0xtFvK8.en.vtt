done<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.539> just<00:02:00.719> simply<00:02:01.259> take<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> USB<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
done that just simply take the USB I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.760 
done that just simply take the USB I
take<00:02:02.999> the<00:02:03.090> SD<00:02:03.210> card<00:02:03.359> out<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.869> USB<00:02:04.170> adapter

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
take the SD card out your USB adapter

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
take the SD card out your USB adapter
and<00:02:04.979> put<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.090> camera

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and put it in your camera

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
and put it in your camera
okay<00:02:08.040> now<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> you've<00:02:08.460> got<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.640> SD<00:02:09.030> card

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
okay now that you've got your SD card

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 
okay now that you've got your SD card
installed<00:02:09.750> backed<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> back<00:02:10.770> into<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
installed backed into the back into the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.250 
installed backed into the back into the
camera<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.630> turn<00:02:12.930> on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
camera all you have to do now is turn on

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.770 
camera all you have to do now is turn on
the<00:02:13.680> inspirer<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.790> sure<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.390> at

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the inspirer now make sure you have at

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.960 
the inspirer now make sure you have at
least<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.260> half<00:02:16.500> charge<00:02:16.890> battery<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
least a half charge battery because the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.490 
least a half charge battery because the
update<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.540> take<00:02:18.810> quite<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> few<00:02:19.350> minutes

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
update can take quite a few minutes

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.980 
update can take quite a few minutes
sometimes<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.790> reckon<00:02:21.120> up<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.330> 25<00:02:21.780> minutes

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
sometimes they reckon up to 25 minutes

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.020 
sometimes they reckon up to 25 minutes
so<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.830> battery<00:02:23.130> goes<00:02:23.160> flat<00:02:23.310> during<00:02:23.760> your

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so if the battery goes flat during your

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.390 
so if the battery goes flat during your
update<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.930> would<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.320> very<00:02:25.560> bad<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.190> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
update that would be very bad so I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
update that would be very bad so I
generally<00:02:26.670> always<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> fully<00:02:27.510> charged

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
generally always have a fully charged

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.010 
generally always have a fully charged
battery<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.710> progress<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:30.780> let<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
battery for this progress I just let the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:40.130 
battery for this progress I just let the
camera<00:02:31.170> calibrate<00:02:31.710> itself<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.840> you'll<00:02:39.990> know

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
camera calibrate itself now you'll know

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.670 
camera calibrate itself now you'll know
here

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
here

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.350 
here
you've<00:02:40.920> probably<00:02:41.190> got<00:02:41.430> more<00:02:41.640> than<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> normal

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you've probably got more than the normal

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.870 
you've probably got more than the normal
startup<00:02:43.080> noise<00:02:43.530> you've<00:02:43.860> got<00:02:44.070> uh<00:02:44.100> these<00:02:44.670> are

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
startup noise you've got uh these are

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880 
startup noise you've got uh these are
constant<00:02:45.360> beeping<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.140> that's<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.740> basically

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
constant beeping and that's it basically

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.610 
constant beeping and that's it basically
now<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.940> firmware<00:02:48.750> update<00:02:51.410> yeah<00:02:52.410> that's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
now in the firmware update yeah that's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010 
now in the firmware update yeah that's
cause<00:02:52.830> dddd<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.209> basically<00:02:54.630> what<00:02:54.870> you're

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
cause dddd that's basically what you're

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.370 
cause dddd that's basically what you're
looking<00:02:55.050> for<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.530> fact<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.810> that's<00:03:01.110> what

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
looking for in fact if I and that's what

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.400 
looking for in fact if I and that's what
you're<00:03:01.530> looking<00:03:01.830> for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.190 

so<00:03:08.010> basically<00:03:08.430> let<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.910> run<00:03:09.240> now<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.020> can

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
so basically let that run now that can

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.590 
so basically let that run now that can
take<00:03:10.230> quite<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> few<00:03:10.800> minutes<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.670> think<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.450> this

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
take quite a few minutes I think on this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.750 
take quite a few minutes I think on this
one<00:03:12.660> actually<00:03:13.020> on<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:13.740> particular<00:03:14.190> firm<00:03:14.610> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
one actually on this particular firm it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.970 
one actually on this particular firm it
only<00:03:14.940> took<00:03:15.150> me<00:03:15.390> about<00:03:15.600> six<00:03:15.960> minutes<00:03:16.320> but<00:03:16.860> they

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
only took me about six minutes but they

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.850 
only took me about six minutes but they
reckon<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.550> 25<00:03:18.180> minutes<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.930> complete<00:03:19.560> so

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
reckon up to 25 minutes to complete so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.200 
reckon up to 25 minutes to complete so
what<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.340> need<00:03:20.460> to<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.790> need<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> let

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
what you need to do is you need to let

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.000 
what you need to do is you need to let
that<00:03:21.240> run<00:03:21.690> until<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.200> nautic<00:03:22.770> changes<00:03:23.250> again

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that run until the nautic changes again

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.380 
that run until the nautic changes again
you'll<00:03:26.010> notice<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> tone<00:03:27.090> has<00:03:27.330> changed

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
you'll notice that the tone has changed

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.230 
you'll notice that the tone has changed
to<00:03:28.050> basically<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.650> single<00:03:29.070> beat<00:03:29.280> pause<00:03:29.880> and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
to basically a single beat pause and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.150 
to basically a single beat pause and
then<00:03:30.420> two<00:03:30.660> quick<00:03:31.020> beeps<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.710> just<00:03:31.890> move<00:03:32.070> we

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
then two quick beeps if I just move we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.340 
then two quick beeps if I just move we
make<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.490> phone<00:03:32.700> call<00:03:33.180> sir<00:03:39.080> that's<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.200> note

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
make the phone call sir that's a note

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.810 
make the phone call sir that's a note
that<00:03:40.530> you're<00:03:40.650> looking<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.610> now

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
that you're looking for and that is now

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.180 
that you're looking for and that is now
the<00:03:41.880> firmware<00:03:42.420> updated<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.650> paradigm

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
the firmware updated so you can paradigm

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.070 
the firmware updated so you can paradigm
the<00:03:44.340> inspire<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:48.480> we'll<00:03:48.600> move<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.930> to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the inspire and then we'll move on to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.100 
the inspire and then we'll move on to
the<00:03:49.410> controller<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> do<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> controller

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the controller now to do the controller

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.440 
the controller now to do the controller
all<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.470> simply<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.010> take<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.640> same<00:03:53.880> SD

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
all you simply do is take the same SD

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.930 
all you simply do is take the same SD
card<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.050> your<00:03:55.260> camera<00:03:55.410> now<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.460> can<00:03:56.850> do

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
card out of your camera now you can do

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.490 
card out of your camera now you can do
one<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.120> two<00:03:57.330> things<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.750> you've<00:03:57.900> got<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> micro

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
one of two things if you've got a micro

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410 
one of two things if you've got a micro
adapter<00:03:59.070> that's<00:03:59.370> actually<00:03:59.850> better<00:04:00.090> and

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
adapter that's actually better and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.210 
adapter that's actually better and
quicker<00:04:00.600> but<00:04:01.230> if<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.440> don't<00:04:01.620> have<00:04:01.770> a<00:04:01.830> micro

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
quicker but if you don't have a micro

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.340 
quicker but if you don't have a micro
adapter<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.240> bin<00:04:03.420> fail<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.990> copied

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
adapter the bin fail that you copied

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.640 
adapter the bin fail that you copied
onto<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.860> cameras<00:04:05.670> HD<00:04:06.570> card<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.110> copy<00:04:07.380> onto

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
onto the cameras HD card just copy onto

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.010 
onto the cameras HD card just copy onto
our<00:04:08.130> USB<00:04:08.490> memory<00:04:08.820> stick<00:04:09.330> but<00:04:09.720> I'm<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:09.990> to

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
our USB memory stick but I'm going to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.440 
our USB memory stick but I'm going to
use<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.200> lexer<00:04:11.190> adapter<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.090> simply

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
use a lexer adapter so you just simply

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.200 
use a lexer adapter so you just simply
plug<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.840> into<00:04:13.080> there<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.650> then<00:04:14.190> on<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.670> USB

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
plug that into there and then on the USB

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.300 
plug that into there and then on the USB
sockets<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.200> back<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.830> just<00:04:16.859> want<00:04:17.130> to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
sockets on the back you just want to

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.960 
sockets on the back you just want to
plug<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> into<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.420> USB<00:04:19.290> adapter<00:04:19.799> like<00:04:20.640> that

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
plug it into the USB adapter like that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.300 
plug it into the USB adapter like that
and<00:04:21.420> kind<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.840> same<00:04:22.020> as<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.320> inspire<00:04:22.770> just

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
and kind of the same as the inspire just

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.800 
and kind of the same as the inspire just

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
SD card now one for the model and one

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.490 
SD card now one for the model and one
for<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.730> controller<00:05:42.330> if<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:43.050> open<00:05:43.260> them<00:05:43.380> up

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
for the controller if you open them up

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.750 
for the controller if you open them up
they'll<00:05:43.740> just<00:05:43.860> be<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:44.010> little<00:05:44.220> bit<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.400> text<00:05:44.670> and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
they'll just be a little bit of text and

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.720 
they'll just be a little bit of text and
it<00:05:44.880> will<00:05:45.000> see<00:05:45.240> either<00:05:45.900> failed<00:05:46.770> if<00:05:47.190> it's<00:05:47.580> not

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
it will see either failed if it's not

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.060 
it will see either failed if it's not
updated<00:05:47.880> correctly<00:05:48.360> or<00:05:48.960> it'll<00:05:49.590> either<00:05:49.740> see

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
updated correctly or it'll either see

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.070 
updated correctly or it'll either see
canceled<00:05:51.000> or<00:05:51.300> success

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
canceled or success

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.290 
canceled or success

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
so either canceled or success will

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.080 
so either canceled or success will
