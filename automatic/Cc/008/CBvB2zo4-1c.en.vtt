00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome to the free state follow the 6 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.179
 actually was not planned but there 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.910
 currently the circumstances a bit strange 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.540
 are thinking come out meanwhile and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.000
 we'll see 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 yes we are under the map of gta and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 I take a closer look at all corners 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 how, for example, do we have that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 Military ground support mine 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 hellyer is definitely going for it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.699
 here, of course, pretty awesome as well 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 My computer is with a computer 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.350
 even a helicopter has behaved yes 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 Here , for example, we have a bush 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.530
 just like that stands a little tree 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 somewhere under the motto really strange 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 I would say like the dekom 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.230
 why because there is no idea that has 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 then it means he knows already 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.539
 strange thing but oh well maybe 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.309
 also just coincidence 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.320
 place your mistake or so who knows 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.670
 beautiful 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 In any case, I have many corners 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.650
 It will be looked at if it is there 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.210
 sort of secret tunnel or something 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.100
 but then I do not really have anything 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 found also mounted here 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.900
 the cottage that we all know there 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 There is this strange name 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.200
 from a mountain in this seminar eye 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.500
 or ufo is about how to draw with the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 signs on it and different sketches 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.640
 jetpack and so on maybe 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 but also this room behind is one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.939
 door and gate to a gate but there 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.000
 is as we see nothing 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.000
 special are 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.310
 I tried as close as possible 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.220
 ranzukommen but it has a bit 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.150
 been hard from below 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.190
 Of course you have to be careful 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.470
 do not fly out of the back again 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.840
 prospect returned to the map 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 but I was in the room 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 nothing significant to see 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.070
 only small things but only not even 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.780
 just not saying anything like that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.729
 It's a shame , but you know 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.229
 not even if rockstar something 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.850
 adding a patch can yes 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.010
 Suddenly there was his but 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.220
 then we'll stop again over'm 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.600
 At some point a big patch comes 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.810
 Maybe it will be one 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.810
 kisses run here 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.810
 Yes 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.950
 so here we have this altruist village 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.920
 there is this gates of this drawing 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.019
 looks very similar from the mounted 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 whole mountain the outlines so see that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.510
 quite similar but also here 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.700
 there are no hidden entrances or 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 Tunnelsysteme here is pure 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.610
 Nothing 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.349
 so there is also the myth refutes it 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.400
 is an insider tip to a get back in 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.629
 otherwise we would have outlined the mtg 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.590
 or seen and would have us there 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.180
 can go in 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.470
 but there were times can not be seen 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.060
 Of course, that is because of the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.560
 editor was here but i do not believe him 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.389
 maybe in story mode the whole thing 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.019
 do it again but I also believe 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:17.690
 not that then at some point dice 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.159
 know that some buildings just do not 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.799
 are more developed in one 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.579
 our east africa follow of course 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.900
 Follow has seen that there are many buildings 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.129
 were simply not set up anymore 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.989
 but well, let's say we look 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.349
 again just over at the military 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.480
 there but packed so yes here too 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.889
 military grounds in the halls and such 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.079
 continue and this does not matter 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.139
 worth seeing 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.970
 I looked cuckoo but nothing 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.049
 special because you might have it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.310
 I mean fly in a hall 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.419
 But I should never have done that 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.829
 but I do not think we're there either 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.079
 something would have been found in the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.889
 huge hall there is nothing no ufo 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.889
 in it or something 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.590
 bum Bum 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.830
 pity in any case would have been me 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.390
 he might want something 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.750
 nice easter egg is about thick 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.580
 but fat is not really me 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.940
 every corner looked so interesting 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.430
 these were also the flood channels 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.750
 locked by the bars are there 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.490
 yes it could be left and right 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.990
 mine will be a secret passage in the work 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.640
 but there was nothing there 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:37.320
 make is unfortunately yes Online has tunnel 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.230
 technically not much too 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 Offer 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.410
 actually a nice fat 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.840
 cave would be cool in any case 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.460
 been 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.770
 but well what should you do that is 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 just nothing found 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.710
 what would you have done for him ? 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.900
 Animals like to see so I would have 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.060
 yes, if the military base in 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.919
 secret room would have where you have fat weapons 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.509
 Can find and vehicles maybe 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.970
 or any other interesting ones 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.940
 things where you can discuss about it right 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.819
 I can as no idea what to do with 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.580
 aliens or so or what the gala im 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.470
 secret plane or something 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.720
 who definitely cool or just that 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.160
 with the moon iliad this drawing that 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.130
 there really was something in it but 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.440
 apparently it's just that way 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.240
 somehow to deal with that player 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.270
 they search and search and get there 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:43.370
 somehow make up their stories and 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:45.289
 but nothing else 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.699
 nothing nothing nothing just happens 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.610
 nothing nowhere 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.280
 I really have every interesting corner 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.440
 So looking at who knows maybe 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.060
 somewhere far out in the sea country 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.460
 but we can be under the 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.610
 do not fly that we just hope 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.620
 and sporting koubek who knows the sea 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.990
 he is up to a certain limit 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.699
 passable and already pretty far 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.479
 so you can really do a lot more 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.199
 around kuzin 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.789
 who possible that somewhere in any one 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.349
 Direction shit no matter where else 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.000
 Easteregg is hidden far out in the 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.580
 Sea where almost no 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.229
 ground he is from the game that would be 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.860
 possible one and who knows who knows so 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.629
 already blatant 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.039
 and therefore not really easy to 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:36.520
 I watch who is swimming 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:39.689
 once the completely walkable say more 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.870
 me now or passable more 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:46.599
 what to look for is all big i am 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.219
 my border from the sea where the ground 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:50.699
 it is not that far away 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:56.680
 then it goes again kilometers 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:59.650
 and maybe that's what it was 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.180
 In any case, for the sec, we follow 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.289
 unfortunately have not seen anything special 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.169
 but we have a look toner 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.939
 thrown and know now 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.740
 but who knows what with upcoming updates 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.979
 we still could have we could 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.610
 grandchildren also look at my idea of ​​it 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:18.969
 Yes, there are some banks where you can not get in 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.310
 Can not really work so you could go there 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:23.710
 Let's see the safe room what is there 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.349
 interesting but no matter I thank you 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.939
 to watch me 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.009
 and yes tomorrow is the last day with 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.599
 Follow this packaged and then go 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.159
 it would have to continue normally then 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:35.529
 here are some other secrets of the 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:40.319
 Turnover play affects many friends 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:40.319
 thanks for watching and vista uncle
