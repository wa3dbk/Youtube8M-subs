00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.440
 hi there, are you looking comparative 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.750
 game review version 2 galaxy note 3 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.639
 n9005 run on snapdragon 800 chipset 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 in quad processor 2 and 3 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 gigahertz and graphics accelerator 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.980
 adreno 330 and the n900 is inside 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.560
 samsung exynos octa 5420 own chip 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 with two processors of 4 cores but 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 only one is used to win 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 operates at a frequency of 1 gigahertz ideas 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
 for the schedule is responsible married t620 8 m n 6 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's test and compare the behavior in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.640
 games 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.160
 Perhaps we will start with antutu although in the light 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.410
 recent events all these tests lost 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.450
 relevance but once we compare 22 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.340
 eat from samsung then why not 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.800
 the result turned out to be quite expected and 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.320
 snapdragon scored almost 37 thousand points 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.870
 overtaking himself but taxi we 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.910
 falls short of 35,000 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.800
 advantage first appeared in the distant 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.810
 RAM speed 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.290
 pray better manifested itself in 3d graphics 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 in the test about angel 20 ax us manifested itself 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.700
 significantly better both finished 30 and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.619
 snapdragon refused to show at all 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.869
 texture and terribly braked lost 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.610
 to your opponent more than three times but 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.619
 itâ€™s probably a matter of optimization 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.090
 the application itself 2 benchmark is 3d 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.760
 mark by running it on 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.710
 n9005 program immediately warned here 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.780
 the same from storm extreme is too 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 simple for him therefore recommends us 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.729
 Only only medal adreno 330 graphics 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.770
 manifested itself clearly better but joined 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.540
 physics what's interesting is to eliminate it with 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 other devices will not work 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.649
 the results of all vessels of smartphones and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.869
 tablets annulled but it's just 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.940
 test and they do not give anything except numbers 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.410
 where more important how the device will manifest itself in 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.410
 games we will now check 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.600
 those who watched the game review and n900 on 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.460
 our channel surely remember that in 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.380
 last asphalt graphics could not be 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.359
 set higher low fortunately in 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.069
 the last update fixed it so 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.020
 what's in both smartphones by default 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.209
 very high quality is established and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.789
 effects most likely work up an jell 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.950
 30 anyway the picture is gorgeous 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.110
 glare blur reflection it's all there 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.340
 no jerking brakes even when 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.080
 collision and of course we could not help 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.880
 check dead trigger 2 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.530
 going into performance settings we 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.360
 we see that the game is the default shot 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.610
 quality is low if we try 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 change to high then warns us 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 that the smartphone is weak for this and for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.310
 health no one answers 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.470
 it is clear that this is just nonsense game 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.930
 works fine in high quality on 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.540
 both smartphones are very high 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.470
 details available only on t-34 but also 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.450
 she would have had no problems recently 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 assassin's creed finger out 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.440
 clear owner optimization problems 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.810
 far from weak devices forced 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.530
 observe soap but fortunately not exynos and 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.510
 snapdragon 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.380
 these problems are not clear 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.359
 beautiful graphics and yes we are there 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 the only problem with the n900 is new 3 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.720
 Unfortunately, is it not in google play not in 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.790
 samsung aps 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.500
 if you install the game not from the store then 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.440
 she will fly out after the initial 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.430
 video but for n9005 the game is available and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.430
 works just fine 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.950
 all other games are identical to real 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.960
 racing 3 gta wai city gangster century with 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 modern combat and many other heavy 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.450
 games go exactly the same 2 storm 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.490
 the basics and the maximum graphics of everything 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.440
 This can be done the following conclusion if 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.240
 You are interested in the game component 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.120
 absolutely no matter which version you are 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.220
 select exynos and snapdragon equally 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
 manifest itself in all the games regardless of the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.209
 test results also with confidence 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.340
 we can say that in gta san andreas and in 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.260
 modern combat 5 both smartphones show 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.730
 yourself the best way the only question is 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.600
 do you need 4g 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.070
 if you need take 9005 and on this from me 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.650
 all subscribe rate 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.780
