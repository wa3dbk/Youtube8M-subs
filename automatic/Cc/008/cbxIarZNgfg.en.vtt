average running shoe but you really

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.029 
average running shoe but you really
can't<00:00:44.040> tell<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.820> small<00:00:45.440> unless<00:00:46.440> you're

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

and<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.219> tune<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:50.969> body

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you're really not going to see the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
you're really not going to see the
difference<00:00:53.550> you're<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> feel<00:00:54.270> the

something<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> take<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
something that's going to take the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
something that's going to take the
impact<00:01:12.030> off<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.470> knees<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.320> increase<00:01:16.320> my

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
two mile run time as well and i thought

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
two mile run time as well and i thought
that<00:01:21.390> i'll<00:01:21.509> give<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> try<00:01:22.140> because<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that i'll give these a try because the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.380 
that i'll give these a try because the
claims<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.330> adidas<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:26.090> making<00:01:27.090> our<00:01:27.619> that

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
claims that adidas is making our that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.410 
claims that adidas is making our that
you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.930> whole<00:01:31.380> energy<00:01:32.420> marketing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you know the whole energy marketing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.359 
you know the whole energy marketing
scheme<00:01:33.810> hey<00:01:34.259> we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> give<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
scheme hey we're going to give you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.480 
scheme hey we're going to give you
energy<00:01:36.079> it's<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> take<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.680> recoil<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
energy it's going to take the recoil and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
energy it's going to take the recoil and
it's<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> act<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> spring<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's going to act like a spring and you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.899 
it's going to act like a spring and you
guys<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.049> happened<00:01:43.590> with

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
guys know how that is that happened with

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.960 
guys know how that is that happened with
with<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> nike<00:01:45.479> shock<00:01:45.979> years<00:01:46.979> ago<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
with the nike shock years ago when it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
with the nike shock years ago when it
first<00:01:48.000> came<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> same<00:01:49.890> claims

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
first came out they had the same claims

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.539 
first came out they had the same claims
or<00:01:51.360> whatever<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> technology<00:01:53.280> has

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
or whatever but now the technology has

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.709 
or whatever but now the technology has
evolved<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.930> bit<00:01:55.280> i'm<00:01:56.299> willing<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.570> give

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
evolved a little bit i'm willing to give

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
evolved a little bit i'm willing to give
these<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> try<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.969> more

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
these a try because we have much more

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.010 
these a try because we have much more
research<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.409> technology

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
research we have more technology

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.029 
research we have more technology
instruments<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.229> gauge<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.610> results<00:02:06.570> of

news so oh but all that said I wanted to
give<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.469> shot<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.209> price<00:02:19.540> tag<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.730> little

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
give it a shot the price tag is a little

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.599 
give it a shot the price tag is a little
steep<00:02:21.969> there<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:23.340> 175<00:02:24.340> dollars<00:02:24.879> at<00:02:25.000> dicks<00:02:25.269> so

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
steep there are 175 dollars at dicks so

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.819 
steep there are 175 dollars at dicks so
that's<00:02:27.609> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.849> expensive<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:29.139> some

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
that's a little expensive for some

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.140 
that's a little expensive for some
foremost<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.920> pretty<00:02:33.189> big<00:02:33.430> hurdle<00:02:33.939> you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
foremost it's a pretty big hurdle you

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.629 
foremost it's a pretty big hurdle you
have<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:34.480> jump<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.139> to<00:02:35.709> purchase<00:02:36.129> these<00:02:36.370> if

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
have to jump to to purchase these if

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.599 
have to jump to to purchase these if
you're<00:02:36.939> going<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:38.159> give<00:02:39.159> them<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:39.370> try

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
you're going to you know give them a try

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.490 
you're going to you know give them a try
but<00:02:40.569> hopefully<00:02:41.469> the<00:02:42.450> benefit<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.720> having

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
but hopefully the benefit of having

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.210 
but hopefully the benefit of having
these<00:02:44.829> shoes<00:02:45.250> what<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.389> see<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.810> cost<00:02:47.220> and

these shoes what you see the cost and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.670 
these shoes what you see the cost and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
hopefully that that cost will be

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.000 
hopefully that that cost will be
exceeded<00:02:51.489> within<00:02:52.419> a<00:02:52.599> decent<00:02:53.139> amount<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.709> time
