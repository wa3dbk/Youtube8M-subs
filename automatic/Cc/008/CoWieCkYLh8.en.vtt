gymnastics world well it has and on any

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
gymnastics world well it has and on any
given<00:00:34.680> night<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.460> mean<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
given night I mean you have to be on you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
given night I mean you have to be on you
have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> hit<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.410> landings<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
have to hit your landings you have to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
have to hit your landings you have to
build<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.450> momentum<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.950> that's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
build on momentum and I think that's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
build on momentum and I think that's
what<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.430> ladies<00:00:41.820> did<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.480> they<00:00:43.020> never<00:00:43.230> gave

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
what our ladies did and they never gave

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.490 
what our ladies did and they never gave
up<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.090> kept<00:00:45.329> fighting<00:00:45.390> until<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.260> last

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
up we just kept fighting until the last

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
up we just kept fighting until the last
routine<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> couldn't<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.270> proud<00:00:48.480> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
routine and I couldn't be more proud of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.260 
routine and I couldn't be more proud of
this<00:00:48.780> team<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.710> feel<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:51.000> won

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
this team because I feel like they won

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
this team because I feel like they won
this<00:00:51.480> through<00:00:51.870> their<00:00:52.020> heart<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.410> soul<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.949> lot

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this through their heart and soul a lot

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.410 
this through their heart and soul a lot
of<00:00:53.160> people<00:00:53.430> may<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.059> you're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
of people may not know this but you're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
of people may not know this but you're
about<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.020> than<00:00:55.230> gymnastics<00:00:55.829> whether

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
about a lot more than gymnastics whether

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.650 
about a lot more than gymnastics whether
it's<00:00:56.160> basketball<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.730> football<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it's basketball or football you know it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's basketball or football you know it
can<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> game<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> runs<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.789> not<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
can be a game of runs what was it not to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
can be a game of runs what was it not to
use<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> pun<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.320> guess<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.859> turn<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> tide<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
use a pun i guess but turn the tide for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
use a pun i guess but turn the tide for
you<00:01:03.000> guys<00:01:03.180> tonight<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.949> started

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you guys tonight well I think we started

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
you guys tonight well I think we started
off<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> balance<00:01:06.510> beam<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
off good on the balance beam and you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
off good on the balance beam and you
can't<00:01:07.500> afford<00:01:07.740> any<00:01:07.979> mistakes<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can't afford any mistakes there and and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
can't afford any mistakes there and and
then<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.189> kept<00:01:11.460> gaining

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then I think we just kept gaining

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
then I think we just kept gaining
momentum<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.840> those<00:01:13.020> 3<00:01:13.350> 99<00:01:13.560> s<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
momentum and we got those 3 99 s at the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
momentum and we got those 3 99 s at the
end<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.430> floor<00:01:14.610> exercise<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.110> turned

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
end of floor exercise and then we turned

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
end of floor exercise and then we turned
it<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.830> vault<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> our

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it up on vault and that's one of our

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.300 
it up on vault and that's one of our
best<00:01:18.390> events<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.860> went<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
best events and then we went to the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 
best events and then we went to the
uneven<00:01:20.700> bars<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.810> maybe<00:01:22.380> our

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
uneven bars and I think that's maybe our

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.710 
uneven bars and I think that's maybe our
most<00:01:22.890> difficult<00:01:23.189> event<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> ladies

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
most difficult event and the ladies

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.090 
most difficult event and the ladies
we're<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.409> denied<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.950> did

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we're not going to be denied they did

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.530 
we're not going to be denied they did
the<00:01:26.250> best<00:01:26.400> job<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.270> year<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the best job that they have all year on

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.200 
the best job that they have all year on
