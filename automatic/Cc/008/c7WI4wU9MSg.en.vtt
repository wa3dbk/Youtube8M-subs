bacon-wrapped<00:00:17.010> cream<00:00:17.430> cheese<00:00:17.640> style<00:00:18.289> but

bacon-wrapped cream cheese style but

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
bacon-wrapped cream cheese style but
they<00:00:19.619> always<00:00:19.740> end<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:20.039> being<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.550> sort<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

right<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> habanero<00:01:04.680> version<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
right here is the habanero version of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.410 
right here is the habanero version of
this<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:08.330> don't<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this and so I'm going to I don't have

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.620 
this and so I'm going to I don't have
any<00:01:09.540> water<00:01:09.720> around<00:01:10.170> me<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.409> anything<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.630> we'll

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
any water around me or anything so we'll

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
any water around me or anything so we'll
see<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:12.990> theory<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.950> believe

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
see if my theory is right and I believe

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
see if my theory is right and I believe
that<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.060> jalapeno<00:01:15.450> poppers<00:01:15.840> always

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that because the jalapeno poppers always

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
that because the jalapeno poppers always
come<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> mild<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.100> doing<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.909> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
come out so mild that doing this with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
come out so mild that doing this with
the<00:01:18.180> habanero<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.470> habanero<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.009> actually

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the habanero the habanero will actually

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.390 
the habanero the habanero will actually
fairly<00:01:20.790> mild<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.530> or<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:23.070> least<00:01:23.250> not

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
fairly mild as well or at least not

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
fairly mild as well or at least not
incredibly<00:01:24.240> hot<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.720> it'll<00:01:25.020> really

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
incredibly hot and I think it'll really

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
incredibly hot and I think it'll really
bring<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.619> some<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> free<00:01:26.460> flavours<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bring out some of the free flavours I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.620 
bring out some of the free flavours I
typically<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.229> fairly<00:01:28.829> spicy<00:01:29.189> foods<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
typically like fairly spicy foods so I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.600 
typically like fairly spicy foods so I
may<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:31.950> hot<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.520> know

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
may not think it's really hot you know

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
may not think it's really hot you know
I've<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.030> been<00:01:33.299> wrong<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I've also been wrong about a lot of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.120 
I've also been wrong about a lot of
things<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.780> could<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.229> devastating<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
things so this could be devastating so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
things so this could be devastating so
I'm<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> eat<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> we'll

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
I'm gonna I'm going to eat it and we'll

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.850 
I'm gonna I'm going to eat it and we'll
see<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.500> happens

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
see what happens

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:52.489 
see what happens
so

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.770 

and<00:01:53.499> as<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.859> see<00:01:54.039> it's<00:01:54.189> up<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.630> gyms

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
and as you can see it's up up the gyms

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.179 
and as you can see it's up up the gyms
not<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.079> great<00:01:56.229> there<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:58.270> habanero<00:01:59.100> move<00:02:00.100> to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
not so great there well habanero move to

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.819 
not so great there well habanero move to
the<00:02:00.310> orange<00:02:00.549> genus<00:02:00.759> over<00:02:00.909> there<00:02:01.060> or<00:02:01.990> or<00:02:02.409> or

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
the orange genus over there or or or

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.499 
the orange genus over there or or or
genus<00:02:03.219> if<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.549> word<00:02:04.229> hmm<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.479> a

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
genus if that's a word hmm it is a

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.619 
genus if that's a word hmm it is a
little<00:02:07.689> spicy<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:10.060> definitely<00:02:10.330> kind<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.509> a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
little spicy it's definitely kind of a

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.140 
little spicy it's definitely kind of a
bit<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.349> lingering<00:02:11.650> spice<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
bit of a lingering spice but it's a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.750 
bit of a lingering spice but it's a
really<00:02:13.450> good<00:02:13.569> flavor<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:15.549> can<00:02:15.640> definitely

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
really good flavor you can definitely

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.940 
really good flavor you can definitely
get<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.840> all<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.080> flavor<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> habanero

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
get the all the flavor of the habanero

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.559 
get the all the flavor of the habanero
because<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.340> cream<00:02:18.640> cheese<00:02:18.819> has<00:02:19.030> diluted<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
because the cream cheese has diluted it

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.080 
because the cream cheese has diluted it
quite<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> bit<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.790> really<00:02:21.849> interesting<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
quite a bit it's really interesting the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.280 
quite a bit it's really interesting the
bacon<00:02:25.390> might<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> bit<00:02:25.870> thick<00:02:26.079> brows

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
bacon might be a bit thick brows

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.229 
bacon might be a bit thick brows
multiple<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.430> thickness<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:28.000> bacon

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
multiple is that thickness of bacon

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.990 
multiple is that thickness of bacon
works<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.599> good<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.870> jalapeno<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
works really good on a jalapeno but you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.520 
works really good on a jalapeno but you
might<00:02:31.150> actually<00:02:31.299> need<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.599> really<00:02:31.989> thin<00:02:32.200> cut<00:02:32.410> or

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
might actually need a really thin cut or

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.509 
might actually need a really thin cut or
even<00:02:32.709> maybe<00:02:32.829> a<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.129> cheaper<00:02:33.459> bacon<00:02:35.519> it's

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
even maybe a like a cheaper bacon it's

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.670 
even maybe a like a cheaper bacon it's
good<00:02:36.670> overpowered

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.429 

hmm<00:02:42.659> those<00:02:43.659> are<00:02:43.810> really<00:02:43.900> good<00:02:44.049> I'm<00:02:44.140> gonna<00:02:44.230> play

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
hmm those are really good I'm gonna play

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.059 
hmm those are really good I'm gonna play
with<00:02:44.530> us<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:46.510> say<00:02:46.689> I<00:02:47.019> tried<00:02:47.709> one<00:02:47.920> with

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
with us I will say I tried one with

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.490 
with us I will say I tried one with
ghost<00:02:48.250> chili<00:02:48.569> or<00:02:49.569> well<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> did<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.049> jalapeno<00:02:50.409> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
ghost chili or well I did a jalapeno and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.380 
ghost chili or well I did a jalapeno and
then<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> did<00:02:50.890> ghost<00:02:51.489> chili<00:02:51.700> powder<00:02:51.939> inside<00:02:52.239> of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
then I did ghost chili powder inside of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.270 
then I did ghost chili powder inside of
it<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.659> that<00:02:52.870> was<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:54.670> was<00:02:54.909> an<00:02:55.060> experience

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it and that was that was an experience

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.259 
it and that was that was an experience
I'll<00:02:57.280> probably<00:02:57.519> experiment<00:02:57.970> with<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> little

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
I'll probably experiment with a little

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.910 
I'll probably experiment with a little
bit<00:02:58.390> more<00:02:58.569> but<00:02:58.810> less<00:02:59.170> aggressively<00:02:59.739> because

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
bit more but less aggressively because

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.280 
bit more but less aggressively because
that<00:03:00.189> took<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> while<00:03:00.939> to<00:03:00.970> recover<00:03:01.150> from<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.230> so

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
that took a while to recover from but so

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.250 
that took a while to recover from but so
far<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.950> think<00:03:03.519> first<00:03:03.700> test<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.329> habanero

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
far I think first test of the habanero

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.030 
far I think first test of the habanero
popper

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
popper

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.220 
popper
it<00:03:06.549> was<00:03:06.670> pretty<00:03:06.849> good<00:03:07.030> we'll<00:03:07.900> try<00:03:08.049> this<00:03:08.109> again

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
it was pretty good we'll try this again

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.710 
it was pretty good we'll try this again
one<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.799> downsides<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.420> peppers

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
one of the downsides is that the peppers

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.809 
one of the downsides is that the peppers
are<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:10.930> small<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:12.250> they're<00:03:12.430> kind<00:03:12.760> of

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
are so small that they're kind of

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.119 
are so small that they're kind of
time-consuming<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.450> make<00:03:13.599> them<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.829> may

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
time-consuming to make them so I may

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.099 
time-consuming to make them so I may
look<00:03:15.280> around<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.609> try<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> find<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.659> some

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
look around and try to find some some

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.309 
look around and try to find some some
larger<00:03:17.500> fresh<00:03:17.950> habaneros<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.879> give<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.420> try

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
larger fresh habaneros to give it a try

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.539 
larger fresh habaneros to give it a try
but<00:03:20.829> we'll<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.069> what<00:03:21.159> happens<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.489> first

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
but we'll see what happens the first

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.839 
but we'll see what happens the first
test<00:03:21.909> so<00:03:22.389> good<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.500> wasn't<00:03:23.849> wasn't

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
test so good and that wasn't wasn't

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:25.890 
test so good and that wasn't wasn't
terrible<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.420> was<00:03:25.510> arrived<00:03:25.690> enough

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
terrible is I think was arrived enough

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.120 
terrible is I think was arrived enough
spice<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.609> play<00:03:27.609> with<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.849> little<00:03:27.879> bit
