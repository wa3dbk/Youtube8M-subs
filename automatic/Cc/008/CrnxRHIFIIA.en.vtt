 an extremely important role 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 today we see in the writings of great philosophers like Plato 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.100

 and therefore this channel of development through the arts 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 is an element that vehicles had already found 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270
 as a fundamental element 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.270

 he credits part of what has been discussed a role 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.099
 also the important increase 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.299
