00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 welcome back to second 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.089
 without blue tower defense battles me 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.689
 play something against fred again 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.550
 look I've still got another idea 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.720
 short of watching yes I do not know 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 so completely what I should take but 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.390
 somehow I've just not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.660
 uses what is that here again 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 I do not care as special things 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 you just take everything for granted 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 I can continue to spy on 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 you do not care but now do not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.590
 I do not see what kind of troops you are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.730
 so what are some buildings is therefore 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 well i see is when you put it but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.320
 That's just where the come from 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.180
 now again from below but by the way 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 welcome from the top shit no matter 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 Now I have to look cool now 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.030
 Also the niger in any case curious 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 what else you hate, you have to do this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 new things are coming out of here now 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 water I would sit namely very 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 inexpensive and not at the end 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.350
 in the end is really good you have to say 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.670
 as I said I have not so now 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.509
 the mega blogs experience has to be 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.770
 I'm a bit surprised 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.790
 What happens now I do not know which 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 update branches are best long 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.979
 building at the spike factory after this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.680
 By the way, the hottest than in the city like 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.689
 you still do not get it then 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.869
 after 23 games I had the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.810
 unlocked yes yes but what about ? 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.049
 select or not what nicole 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.049
 choose 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 yes it has to be said really good 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 Surprise what the colleague with it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 hinbekommt here make the cannon times 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 So I'm watching the factory 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.009
 could not choose every case 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.969
 only move left and right 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.149
 I do not know 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.409
 no idea i think after that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.210
 Select the third fourth victory correctly 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.979
 we can you 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.060
 not me I'm not there yet 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.289
 really busy I have to say 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 there is a even a bit of a gamble 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.980
 that time to test the production runs 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.980
 definitely in full swing 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.590
 there are still some ball and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 scored by the ever a bit 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.410
 high here the mini as well as from below 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.970
 from the team through clever 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 to get used to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.260
 It's a waste of money, I have it 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.459
 I'll have it at the very beginning 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.690
 just quietly pushed through data 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.010
 it worked that was a first 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.160
 I immediately everything in the first round 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:59.730
 shot through or not in the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:02.640
 first in the demo for example too 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.590
 only 112 and so if we 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.410
 Now both the ninjas have that is you 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.780
 have the u-boat so synonymous of new 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.040
 this can be the reactor in the u boot what 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.970
 can be a reactor at the u boot 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.420
 I would once there is no tips 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:30.180
 but it or not for phone too 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:35.310
 here question mark yes and she saves money 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.500
 and then you go closer and you after the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.450
 On the other side, I know again 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.900
 I have to save myself completely now 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.130
 for the film a special vehicle we 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.390
 have to know already but see 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.070
 that's not really good on 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.109
 this route gives better okay so 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:02.570
 see is all right but that's so great 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.570
 what's going on here heart broken 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.540
 yes, where I need no space for it 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.099
 is an advantage 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.049
 Unfortunately, you did not think that 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:19.579
 I'm already the ones below 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:20.989
 spikes off the problem is also the go 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.940
 also faster, that is the comma 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.800
 they also remain set from round to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 round still possible but I can get it 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.080
 come here with me if so 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:35.500
 I come through here there is still 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.500
 not as much 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:54.020
 after all, it already knows how to do it here 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:56.289
 Now I can finally do something 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.289
 because go there 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.720
 now they have some with 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.050
 I have to watch the lumpi that I am 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.260
 caught a little bit again 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.889
 he was not good at all 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.970
 that was not as good as lost 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.030
 real to which I know the heli 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:32.599
 hope that makes the thing because 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:34.550
 okay what did he come on the song 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:43.460
 Now , quite a lot come 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:45.730
 balloons live on 1 396 that is 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.490
 of course now 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.810
 so far harder difficult I know 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.190
 not exactly what I was all for 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.520
 a tactic i now drive the u boats 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.260
 are so good at which I already quite good 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.710
 out of the line - here I miss the rocket 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:09.290
 for the softing by skillful close like that 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.130
 often went through the flood I 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.389
 no more spikes 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.980
 I do not know the spikes clever 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.600
 that's shit but only you 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.180
 you hardly have anything you have hardly anything 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.080
 just lost madrilenen yes I have to too 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:28.460
 if i hope i am often at 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:31.790
 audience and it will be bad 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.470
 individually decided that the shit her 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:45.950
 have come through there with you yes that 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:47.510
 was it coming now i was shit that 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.620
 it was again head to head running 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.090
 I would not last five seconds no 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.000
 seconds later if we even so 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.169
 been far 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.860
 i got through in the last second 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:05.860
 shot 52 to get here as 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.860
 follow 2 thanks for watching and want ob 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.860
 matthias still succeed the revanche
