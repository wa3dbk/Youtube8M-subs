okay<00:00:07.490> hello<00:00:07.700> everybody

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
okay hello everybody

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.869 
okay hello everybody
slamball<00:00:08.910> zero<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.299> three<00:00:09.619> and<00:00:10.619> today<00:00:11.429> I'm

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
slamball zero to three and today I'm

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.089 
slamball zero to three and today I'm
gonna<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.150> teaching<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.019> last<00:00:13.589> step<00:00:13.859> on

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
gonna be teaching you the last step on

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.839 
gonna be teaching you the last step on
solving<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.609> 5x5<00:00:15.449> rubik's<00:00:15.869> cube<00:00:16.109> because<00:00:16.919> most

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
solving a 5x5 rubik's cube because most

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.659 
solving a 5x5 rubik's cube because most
videos<00:00:18.239> just<00:00:18.630> say<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.860> okay<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.610> you

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
videos just say like okay now that you

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.979 
videos just say like okay now that you
have<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> centers<00:00:21.419> and<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> edge

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989 
have all the centers and all the edge

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.569 
have all the centers and all the edge
piece<00:00:22.259> of<00:00:22.380> soil<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.860> solve<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> three<00:00:23.460> by

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
piece of soil just solve like a three by

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.700 
piece of soil just solve like a three by
three<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.869> tell<00:00:25.020> you<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.169> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
three and they don't tell you how so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.920 
three and they don't tell you how so
doesn't<00:00:25.860> make<00:00:25.980> any<00:00:26.160> sense

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
doesn't make any sense

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.269 
doesn't make any sense
so<00:00:27.930> today<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.439> gonna<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.800> gonna<00:00:29.040> show

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so today I'm gonna actually gonna show

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.010 
so today I'm gonna actually gonna show
you<00:00:29.460> how<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.610> finish<00:00:29.879> it<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:30.540> I<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.930> I

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
you how to finish it because I know I

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.590 
you how to finish it because I know I
didn't<00:00:31.469> understand<00:00:31.860> what<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.219> meant<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.730> so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
didn't understand what they meant and so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.520 
didn't understand what they meant and so
that's<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:33.989> I'm<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.289> showing<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that's what I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
that's what I'm gonna be showing you
thing<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> solve<00:00:37.280> 303<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
thing so the way I solve 303 is first I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.240 
thing so the way I solve 303 is first I
get<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> cross<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:40.829> also<00:00:41.070> what

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
get a cross on top and that's also what

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
get a cross on top and that's also what
you<00:00:41.310> have<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.880> sorry<00:00:42.690> sure<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you have to do here sorry sure that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.780 
you have to do here sorry sure that
looks<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:44.420> just<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.840> cross<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
looks like just get the cross like that

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.190 
looks like just get the cross like that
looks<00:00:48.630> like<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> five<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:50.880> five

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
looks like that and on the five by five

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.560 
looks like that and on the five by five
you<00:00:52.200> do<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> same<00:00:52.710> thing<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> first<00:00:56.570> just

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you do the same thing so you first just

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.530 
you do the same thing so you first just
across<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.360> that<00:01:05.210> now<00:01:06.210> let's<00:01:06.420> look

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
across just like that now let's look

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.219 
across just like that now let's look
that<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> three<00:01:07.590> layered<00:01:08.340> cross<00:01:09.229> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that it's like a three layered cross so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
that it's like a three layered cross so
that's<00:01:10.469> what<00:01:10.829> it<00:01:10.890> looks<00:01:11.009> like<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.149> next

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that's what it looks like then the next

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.849 
that's what it looks like then the next
thing<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.569> do<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.959> whine<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.319> these<00:01:13.499> two

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859 
thing I do is I whine up these two

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:15.800 
thing I do is I whine up these two
colors<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.459> so<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.179> this<00:01:15.270> case<00:01:15.509> you'd<00:01:15.719> be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
colors here so in this case you'd be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.730 
colors here so in this case you'd be
lining<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.259> ones<00:01:16.709> up<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.039> these<00:01:17.579> three<00:01:18.740> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
lining these ones up here these three so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.209 
lining these ones up here these three so
if<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.429> looks<00:01:20.639> like<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
if that looks like like that

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.029 
if that looks like like that
so<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:26.789> suppose<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.240> end<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.740> we're<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.859> do

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
so these suppose I end up we're gonna do

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.719 
so these suppose I end up we're gonna do
it<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.649> course<00:01:34.679> when<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.520> doing

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it here and of course when you're doing

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.050 
it here and of course when you're doing
it<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.999> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.359> also<00:01:37.069> keep<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.279> cross<00:01:38.549> like

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it you have to also keep the cross like

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.529 
it you have to also keep the cross like
that<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.899> all<00:01:39.929> that<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.499> lined<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:41.149> no<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:42.209> I<00:01:42.329> end

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
that so all that is lined up no so I end

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.449 
that so all that is lined up no so I end
up<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.529> next<00:01:43.799> thing<00:01:43.889> I<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.039> is<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
up now the next thing I do is get the

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.480 
up now the next thing I do is get the
corners<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:46.170> match<00:01:46.349> these<00:01:46.590> two<00:01:46.799> colors<00:01:47.159> so

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
corners that match these two colors so

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.649 
corners that match these two colors so
they're<00:01:47.639> eight<00:01:47.729> corners<00:01:47.969> up<00:01:48.209> there<00:01:50.389> so<00:01:51.389> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
they're eight corners up there so this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.489 
they're eight corners up there so this
is<00:01:51.719> red<00:01:52.139> so<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.499> line<00:01:52.709> up<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.009> red<00:01:53.130> side<00:01:54.439> put<00:01:55.439> her

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
is red so I line up the red side put her

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.960 
is red so I line up the red side put her
up<00:01:55.619> there

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:09.940 

there<00:02:08.649> there

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
there there

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.570 
there there
hey<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.580> like<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.850> tea<00:02:11.060> type<00:02:11.510> shape<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
hey if like a tea type shape this the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.810 
hey if like a tea type shape this the
corners<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:15.190> middle<00:02:16.190> pieces<00:02:16.400> lined<00:02:16.670> up

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
corners and the middle pieces lined up

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.210 
corners and the middle pieces lined up
and<00:02:17.060> after<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.330> same<00:02:17.540> thing<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.980> put

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
and after the same thing here so put

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.000 
and after the same thing here so put
that<00:02:19.280> corner<00:02:19.850> right<00:02:20.800> there

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
that corner right there

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:39.100 
that corner right there
matches<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> blue<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.210> red<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.900> last

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
matches the blue in the red in the last

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.500 
matches the blue in the red in the last
corner<00:02:40.510> over<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.530> looks<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
corner over there it looks like that and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.290 
corner over there it looks like that and
now<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.170> next<00:02:45.530> step<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.550> solving<00:02:47.030> these<00:02:47.090> edge

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
now the next step is solving these edge

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.800 
now the next step is solving these edge
pieces<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:48.110> match<00:02:48.200> these<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:48.739> colleges<00:02:49.570> so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.420 

able<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> look<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.500> I'm<00:02:54.860> sorry<00:02:55.130> edge

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
able to look like that I'm sorry edge

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.560 
able to look like that I'm sorry edge
piece<00:02:58.870> and<00:03:00.400> reasoning<00:03:01.400> line<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.090> fast<00:03:02.330> is

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
piece and reasoning line so fast is

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.030 
piece and reasoning line so fast is
because<00:03:02.600> obviously<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
because obviously you don't have to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
because obviously you don't have to
solve<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.310> 3x3<00:03:04.850> where<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.810> buy<00:03:06.019> five<00:03:06.320> by

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
solve a 3x3 where you just buy five by

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.320 
solve a 3x3 where you just buy five by
five<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.350> well<00:03:09.880> then<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.060> pretty

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
five if you do well then you pretty

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.380 
five if you do well then you pretty
stupid<00:03:13.209> all<00:03:14.209> right

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
stupid all right

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.690 
stupid all right
and<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.660> looks<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:16.030> same<00:03:17.030> thing<00:03:17.060> here

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and it looks like that same thing here

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it looks like that same thing here
put<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.880> edge<00:03:19.970> pieces<00:03:20.299> in

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:51.860 

just<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.920> Lexi<00:03:29.430> Jackson<00:03:30.500> edgy

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.470 

last<00:03:52.870> one

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
last one

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.280 
last one
and<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.780> looks<00:03:55.990> like<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.860> around<00:03:58.290> looks

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
and it looks like that all around looks

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.880 
and it looks like that all around looks
like<00:03:59.410> that

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
like that

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.150 
like that
the<00:04:00.640> next<00:04:01.000> step<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.300> flipping<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.720> keel<00:04:01.930> over

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the next step is flipping the keel over

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.940 
the next step is flipping the keel over
overhang<00:04:03.160> getting<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:03.970> last<00:04:04.180> third<00:04:04.600> layer

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
overhang getting that last third layer

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.920 
overhang getting that last third layer
see<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.010> look<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:06.370> either<00:04:06.790> an<00:04:07.030> L<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.630> top<00:04:07.780> of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
see you look for either an L the top of

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.750 
see you look for either an L the top of
the<00:04:08.260> line<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.280> want<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.490> get<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.670> that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
the line and you want to get to that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.900 
the line and you want to get to that
cross<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.510> we<00:04:10.570> have<00:04:10.750> an<00:04:10.870> L<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:12.340> we<00:04:12.460> didn't<00:04:12.760> if

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
cross so we have an L so we didn't if

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.970 
cross so we have an L so we didn't if
that<00:04:14.940> algorithm<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.810> get<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.140> but<00:04:17.950> she

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
that algorithm to get it but she

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.690 
that algorithm to get it but she
shouldn't<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:19.830> okay<00:04:20.860> and<00:04:21.130> same<00:04:21.459> thing<00:04:21.489> here

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
shouldn't know okay and same thing here

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.850 
shouldn't know okay and same thing here
we<00:04:22.150> have<00:04:22.270> an<00:04:22.420> L<00:04:22.600> see<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.050> looks<00:04:23.320> like<00:04:23.500> it's<00:04:23.770> like

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
we have an L see it looks like it's like

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.690 
we have an L see it looks like it's like
a<00:04:23.920> three<00:04:24.250> layered<00:04:24.550> over<00:04:24.850> again<00:04:25.920> so<00:04:26.920> you<00:04:26.980> do<00:04:27.190> ya

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
a three layered over again so you do ya

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.830 
a three layered over again so you do ya
gonna<00:04:28.830> front<00:04:30.150> right<00:04:31.410> up<00:04:32.410> right<00:04:33.420> inverted<00:04:34.420> up

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
gonna front right up right inverted up

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.780 
gonna front right up right inverted up
and<00:04:35.110> averted<00:04:36.180> front<00:04:37.180> reverted<00:04:37.540> on<00:04:38.640> repeat<00:04:39.640> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
and averted front reverted on repeat the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.010 
and averted front reverted on repeat the
same<00:04:40.000> thing<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:42.100> get<00:04:42.250> your<00:04:42.400> cross<00:04:43.020> okay

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
same thing and you get your cross okay

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.150 
same thing and you get your cross okay
now<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.200> next<00:04:44.320> step<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.710> lining<00:04:44.980> these<00:04:45.100> up

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
now the next step is lining these up

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.240 
now the next step is lining these up
flicky<00:04:45.760> had<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.970> do<00:04:46.060> before

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
flicky had to do before

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.610 
flicky had to do before
so<00:04:48.250> here's<00:04:48.640> two<00:04:49.300> there<00:04:49.660> put<00:04:50.230> them<00:04:50.350> on<00:04:50.530> the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
so here's two there put them on the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.960 
so here's two there put them on the
right<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:50.980> back<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:54.100> they're<00:04:54.580> all<00:04:54.760> lined

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
right in the back and they're all lined

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.380 
right in the back and they're all lined
up<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.770> air<00:04:56.860> we<00:04:56.980> have<00:04:57.010> one<00:04:57.310> at<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.060> front<00:04:58.210> and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
up the air we have one at the front and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.920 
up the air we have one at the front and
one<00:04:58.510> go<00:04:58.720> back<00:04:59.160> so<00:05:00.160> do<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.090> same<00:05:01.330> algorithm

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
one go back so do the same algorithm

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.810 
one go back so do the same algorithm
this<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.380> three<00:05:02.890> recipe<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.280> line<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.669> left

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
this the three recipe to line the left

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.470 
this the three recipe to line the left
you<00:05:04.630> get<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:08.220> put<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.310> like<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.360> of

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
you get to put it like that and all of

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.370 
you get to put it like that and all of
them<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.810> like<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:12.720> just<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:14.080> case<00:05:14.200> you

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
them I like that and just in case you

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.020 
them I like that and just in case you
don't<00:05:14.500> really<00:05:14.890> algorithms<00:05:15.550> or<00:05:15.669> whatever<00:05:15.910> I'll

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
don't really algorithms or whatever I'll

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.500 
don't really algorithms or whatever I'll
just<00:05:16.060> post<00:05:16.390> in<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.660> video<00:05:16.780> description

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
just post in the video description

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.480 
just post in the video description
okay<00:05:19.510> now<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:19.900> corners<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:21.010> this<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:21.400> you

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
okay now the corners like this so you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.800 
okay now the corners like this so you
look<00:05:21.640> for<00:05:21.669> a<00:05:21.820> corner<00:05:21.970> that<00:05:22.240> has<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.630> three

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
look for a corner that has the three

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.950 
look for a corner that has the three
matching<00:05:23.260> colors<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:25.180> three<00:05:25.660> watching

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
matching colors to the three watching

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.360 
matching colors to the three watching
sides<00:05:26.200> here<00:05:26.380> so<00:05:26.410> here<00:05:26.740> we<00:05:26.830> have<00:05:26.950> here's<00:05:27.160> one

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
sides here so here we have here's one

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.460 
sides here so here we have here's one
red<00:05:28.090> blue<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:28.960> yellow

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
red blue and yellow

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.980 
red blue and yellow
so<00:05:30.310> we<00:05:30.520> do<00:05:30.640> this<00:05:30.850> like<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.240> huh<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.750> then<00:05:34.900> do

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
so we do this like that huh and then do

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.720 
so we do this like that huh and then do
we<00:05:35.080> have<00:05:35.200> this<00:05:35.380> corner<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.919> my<00:05:36.040> channel<00:05:36.370> honey

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
we have this corner to my channel honey

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.930 
we have this corner to my channel honey
up<00:05:36.940> there<00:05:37.150> same<00:05:38.020> thing<00:05:38.050> here

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
up there same thing here

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.570 
up there same thing here
Oh<00:05:40.000> Oh<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.720> corners<00:05:40.990> already<00:05:41.260> lined<00:05:41.410> up

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
Oh Oh the corners already lined up

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.450 
Oh Oh the corners already lined up
somehow<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.760> do<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.860> right<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:44.980> really<00:05:45.160> down

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
somehow you do the right and really down

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.100 
somehow you do the right and really down
butyrate<00:05:46.030> down

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
butyrate down
