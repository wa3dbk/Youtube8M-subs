multiplier beta and that's going to be

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
multiplier beta and that's going to be
kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> important<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.719> also<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
kind of important we also get a little

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.939 
kind of important we also get a little
user's<00:01:01.770> guide<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.949> completely

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
user's guide thing which is completely

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.750 
user's guide thing which is completely
gray<00:01:05.519> pretty<00:01:06.450> boring<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.990> thin<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.760> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
gray pretty boring pretty thin too so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690 
gray pretty boring pretty thin too so
hopefully<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.310> giant

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hopefully this game will be a giant

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.980 
hopefully this game will be a giant
benchmark<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.920> original<00:01:14.250> crisis<00:01:14.610> was

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
benchmark like the original crisis was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.969 
benchmark like the original crisis was
because<00:01:15.990> I've<00:01:16.200> heard<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.530> talk<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
because I've heard some talk that it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
because I've heard some talk that it
might<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
might not be and that would kind of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.289 
might not be and that would kind of
disappointment<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.970> should<00:01:21.000> load

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
disappointment so I think we should load

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.200 
disappointment so I think we should load
this<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:22.979> system<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.520> 24<00:01:23.939> 80s

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this up and to our system with 24 80s

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
this up and to our system with 24 80s
see<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.229> max<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.350 

hey<00:01:33.000> guys<00:01:33.180> welcome<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:34.520> i'm<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.760> i<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.000> hear

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
me with these raging Fermi's but we got

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
me with these raging Fermi's but we got
a<00:01:40.620> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.190> game<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.780> say

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
a little bit into the game I have to say

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
a little bit into the game I have to say
don't<00:01:43.980> really<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> gameplay<00:01:47.910> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
don't really like it the gameplay it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
don't really like it the gameplay it
just<00:01:48.780> doesn't<00:01:48.930> feel<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.410> same<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:50.160> feels<00:01:50.400> very

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just doesn't feel the same it feels very

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
just doesn't feel the same it feels very
sluggish<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> unrefined<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:54.110> don't<00:01:55.110> even

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
sluggish and unrefined I don't even

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.320 
sluggish and unrefined I don't even
think<00:01:55.320> directors<00:01:55.860> 11<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.340> supported<00:01:56.850> right

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
think directors 11 is supported right

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330 
think directors 11 is supported right

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
like it will be supported later none of

junk<00:02:31.170> card<00:02:31.410> too<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.209> think<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> 59<00:02:34.170> he

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
junk card too so I think when the 59 he

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.610 
junk card too so I think when the 59 he
comes<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.820> maybe<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.940> driver<00:02:36.209> update<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:37.260> fix

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
comes out maybe a driver update on fix

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.530 
comes out maybe a driver update on fix
all<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:40.760> there's<00:02:41.760> no<00:02:41.880> benchmarks

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
all this but there's no benchmarks

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.160 
all this but there's no benchmarks
that's<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.049> knowing<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.880> not<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that's kind of knowing it's not like you

add a breadboard setting freeze in the
higher<00:05:38.270> graphic<00:05:39.110> settings<00:05:39.320> because<00:05:39.950> there's

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
higher graphic settings because there's

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.150 
higher graphic settings because there's
only<00:05:40.430> three<00:05:40.760> more<00:05:41.030> show<00:05:41.599> you<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:41.900> will<00:05:42.080> fast

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.029
