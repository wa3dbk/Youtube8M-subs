00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.780
 we are back there fishing and echoing 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.940
 fishing is still boiling and you will 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.130
 understand why the waters of these small 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.700
 are hot not having native fish 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.439
 the year just looks personal and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.840
 show you two assemblies here 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.029
 very simple that we are doing and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.829
 that is working out the right answer only 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.960
 the pitch in a little hat shopping 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.519
 neighbor here has a line of fluorine 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:42.250
 carbon of about 25 pounds 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:49.589
 43 links a meter and with which the whip and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:53.499
 here at the tip a little sign 8 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.739
 in exactly the same way I have 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:59.159
 here a good whole week with the same 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.629
 money with the same line diameter 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:08.110
 flower finished and a little sign 9 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.229
 because this buoy is good with the same 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.939
 first title has already collapsed this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.520
 Wood is going to be, then we go. 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.909
 relation to the consignment becomes barley 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 and location where the fish can attack when 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.259
 a bit more annoying as is a 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.130
 a little more suspicious that we make the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.530
 people go first is to be enough 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.229
 change one with sling the paper is over 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.240
 let this wood rest place and 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.070
 after he did start to climb what the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 we do we shipment a buoy 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.310
 more discreet to make less noise 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.500
 in water - volume - color then the fish is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.020
 it easier to attack than good 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.570
 this wood that is planned here is me 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.729
 I usually like to use buoys and wood 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.020
 the sling and then the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.270
 good girl this here 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.149
 the lines we are using from 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.420
 Monofilament primer is to attract the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.679
 end of 25 pounds she'll give zero 40 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.649
 minutes 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.270
 It's okay to make the whips of 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:13.490
 focus cake also brings a leader clash 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.270
 25 pounds for the mother not about 0 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.240
 43 minutes 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.940
 It's good and here they only use us in this minute. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.640
 which is rounding dinho you saw 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.400
 Now you want us to put a reason 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 zinha then what we're in this nine 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.120
 number 8 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.980
 these two extremely important assembly lines 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.140
 simple one that is working and has 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.240
 a lot of other assemblies that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.240
 We'll talk to you later. 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.709
 Hey 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.450
 the strength that china 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.440
 the happened 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.440
 the world 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.599
 the hunt at 66 kilos of oil does not leave and 56 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.170
 pounds at most did not force him to do 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.580
 it took much more 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.580
 I abused you now, the companion. 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.580
 parana 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:30.370
 i connected in 3 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:33.640
 Thanks for the information. 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.650
 I go on the bank and started to fight 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.630
 that there is not really big fish but 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:45.270
 looks just not as good a thing going well 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:48.160
 Yellow even fight that was very 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.530
 This machine is the same tobacco I think 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:58.890
 that is one thing is much bigger is not water 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.890
 direct is favorable 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.219
 in this fish stock is a result of 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:24.319
 extremely clean water that keeps 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.079
 high temperature leaving the 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.659
 active fish at any time of the year 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.209
 inside the hot river resorts are 18 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:36.639
 sources of thermal waters supplying 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:36.639
 all complex with several attractions 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:57.129
 and after the commercials the fishery is 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:06:00.219
 made at night has beautiful freak wings and 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.249
 great surprises iluska plunges the side 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.110
 side of Amazonian species do not miss the 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.110
 ps alternative back now
