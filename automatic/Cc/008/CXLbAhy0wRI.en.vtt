00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
tactility right-sizing what makes it we

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.080 
tactility right-sizing what makes it we
are<00:01:32.229> different<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.770> gives<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.549> potential

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
are different and gives it the potential

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.270
