00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 and that which has a lot of illusion 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.010
 to see how it is worth 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.960
 or what is not what is 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.770
 I know what it is but I do not know how it is 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.770
 exactly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.660
 good to see you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 what they have brought me a lot of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 cartonboard 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.140
 actually I guess that below 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.790
 This is 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:52.580
 the male and the mouse fix 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.580
 I can see here, it's worth 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.469
 it's a pass and I do not know if it 's so 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.420
 complicated to open it but if not good 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.360
 then they taught him then he spoke and we 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 I teach 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.990
 How is it 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.400
 and on the other hand 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 this is this 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.890
 to this the strike but good to see you 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.570
 declared good has a lot of 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.909
 flavor history villas for 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.050
 and others but see what keyboard 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.850
 good backlit you have here you see 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.340
 good everything what all the little things that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.340
 You have to go teaching right now 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.290
 Well, we're here more than 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 close so you can appreciate everything 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.060
 the detail of this this piece of 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.590
 mechanical keyboard that's good then 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 it's also super full of ozone this 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.760
 is the keyboard is worth you saw the letters 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.050
 backlit of good time so 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.710
 I only have the red ones but we can 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.870
 configure it and also the neon mouse 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.610
 better ozone also good that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.510
 also good because I'm going to talk to you 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.700
 little bit about it is good 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.090
 first talk about the mouse the mouse 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.700
 Neon that you are going to be able to come with him 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.950
 with the mouse that oscillates around the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.530
 50 euros worth is what goes for this reason 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.920
 a software is coming to you as it is like 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.040
 is this and you are going to be able to configure your 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.410
 8 buttons that also good because it has a 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.730
 Ergonomic design that fits very well 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
 at your hand it is worth 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 you are going to be able to good because you are going to be able to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.190
 move the good mouse I do not know 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.120
 the delay that has 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.110
 good can be adjusted we go 12 minutes 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.920
 of delay be nothing 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.650
 adjustable to 125 250 500 and 1000 and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.770
 funny has has a memory of 128 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.990
 internal kilobytes is worth so for that 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.660
 can you configure your buttons 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.080
 independently if it takes one 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.880
 person or another and what is said comes with 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520
 the software so you can attract it 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.800
 everything correctly is not complicated 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.890
 goodbye to me I have not even touched yet the 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.600
 software is worth just good so you 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.490
 it comes configured a way what am I 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.260
 using that form that is the one that uses 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.250
 then practically the majority 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.360
 and the truth is that it is very good 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.780
 the 6400 laser sensor that also has 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.780
 it's incredible since you see that it's good 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.920
 that is a support the d 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.680
 of mouse and well, here we have in the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.410
 little box will come everything like maybe 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.500
 pretty much explained so that what 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.790
 You can see that you can see 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.190
 Well, those eight buttons is what 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.320
 does it makes it pretty special good and 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.480
 then on the other hand the keyboard is the 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.010
 keyboard that also of course comes 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.409
 with 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.230
 with the software that you can install it in 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.129
 your pc and well then say not this 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.860
 keyboard that is worth about 90 euros and good 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.590
 you see that the letters there are 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.930
 well the letters are backlit and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.260
 just clicking here and here it's worth 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.320
 you are going to be able to make that they stop 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.510
 illuminate the pods of the keys and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.850
 you will turn them back on 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.130
 now this blinking mode is saying that 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.190
 so that the game keys let's say 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:36.229
 for gamers they appear in red 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.400
 worth those and those and the rest are illuminated 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.900
 blank is worth 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.350
 and good if we give it back we can 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.199
 leave it we can leave them fixed and even 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.330
 we can give it back for more 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.949
 lighting is worth or remove them and leave them 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.590
 Well, as I had it, not only 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.560
 the red ones light up well that already 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.680
 You yourselves is also good if you 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.570
 you set here back vale has 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.169
 can you put this up for more 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.669
 comfort even the cable you can what 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.560
 you can divert on the side you want 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.350
 also so that you do not bother the cable 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.350
 and if you look here you have several 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.740
 entries an additional usb and input 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.650
 audio or paracas for helmets 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.930
 ok and input also for the microphone 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.389
 so you will not have anything like that 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.000
 plug anything into your pc not so 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.070
 you have everything nearer good is optional 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.169
 not of course I for example the children 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.660
 good moment of movement we are going to 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.380
 say at the moment I have it I have it 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.630
 put at a level on the computer but 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.740
 maybe I'll change it and put it behind 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.630
 because the truth is that it comes very well 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.139
 that is to say that not because the keyboard 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.389
 Mechanical differentiates it from membrane 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.789
 that the membrane ones have a membrane 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.590
 a kind of band-aid like rubber 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.740
 plastic below all the keys 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.930
 and these, because each key is independent 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.210
 let's say it's a key that is plugged in 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.490
 and well then that also at the time of 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.509
 change them and other deterioration these 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.970
 keyboards last a lot more has the 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.250
 has this worth to support the arm that 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.500
 it makes it much more much more comfortable worth 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.659
 and well, I do not know what else to tell you 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.030
 say that it is advisable to one hundred 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:22.099
 One hundred no longer, not because of me, but because of 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.259
 several people who have tried it and all 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.530
 they have spoken to me very well about him and good 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.360
 I hope you liked this one 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.240
 small review you already know that neither 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.430
 I'm a keyboard player is worth and neither 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.560
 I have a lot of ideas but I already tell you that I have 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.240
 talked to several people who did 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.930
 yes they use it and play games 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.639
 like the sun for example that it is 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.009
 a game like this so to use more the 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.050
 keyboard and you know what else I use the 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.330
 command of the console although the keyboard 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.969
 I use but then to write and so on 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.070
 Well, they sent me this keyboard and 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.460
 this mouse puts you and the network that 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.960
 I appreciate so much I have not gotten 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.090
 to make a draw but I hope to be able to 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.699
 get it produced and that is that 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.340
 you know kids like it so that 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.710
 these two areas say host how handsome and 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.169
 you know how many people have seen no and 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.969
 Well surely I hope to be able 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.219
 get something for all of you 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:19.769
 after some draw among all those who 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.449
 the channel is said so you know 

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:23.899
 maximum support for this type of kids 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:26.369
 things because they are the ones that later make 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:28.679
 get more things is worth it for a 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:30.629
 draw for some history like that a 

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:34.579
 I welcome kids and see you in the 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.579
