00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
like your own hopefully you wouldn't do

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.940 
like your own hopefully you wouldn't do
that<00:00:43.950> though<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> pack<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.620> comes

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that though so in this pack it comes

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.240 
that though so in this pack it comes
with<00:00:47.239> six<00:00:48.239> bundles<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.930> hair<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:51.320> 22<00:00:52.320> 18<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
with six bundles of hair to 22 18 and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.889 
with six bundles of hair to 22 18 and
216<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.739> closure<00:00:56.149> which<00:00:57.149> isn't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
216 and then also a closure which isn't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.160 
216 and then also a closure which isn't
the<00:00:58.289> best<00:00:58.469> closure<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> world

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
the best closure in the world

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.520 
the best closure in the world
so<00:01:01.430> these<00:01:02.430> bundles<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:03.899> pretty

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so these bundles actually look pretty

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
so these bundles actually look pretty
decent<00:01:04.739> um<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> curl<00:01:06.210> pattern

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
decent um you can see the curl pattern

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.580 
decent um you can see the curl pattern
on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> hair<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.420> bundles

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
on the hair this is actually two bundles

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the hair this is actually two bundles
they<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> enough<00:01:12.140> hair<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> included<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they say that enough hair is included in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
they say that enough hair is included in

this to do your entire head I'll
probably<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:18.030> making<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:19.340> u-part<00:01:20.340> wig<00:01:20.369> with

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

this<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.299> haven't<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.170> decided<00:01:22.380> yet<00:01:22.970> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
this I haven't really decided yet so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.550 
this I haven't really decided yet so
this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.640> 20<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.180> 18<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this is the 20 this is the 18 and then I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.950 
this is the 20 this is the 18 and then I
don't<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
don't know if you can see this

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
don't know if you can see this
rinky-dinky<00:01:33.960> closure<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.009> included

rinky-dinky closure that they included

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.850 
rinky-dinky closure that they included
um<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.259> important<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.619> me<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
um it was really important for me to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
um it was really important for me to
know<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.040> kinda<00:01:38.430> closure<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.939> included

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
know what kinda closure was included

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.080 
know what kinda closure was included
with<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.759> kinda<00:01:41.810> didn't<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:44.090> find

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
with this but I kinda didn't really find

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.380 
with this but I kinda didn't really find
any<00:01:45.420> information<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:47.390> these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
any information on that and then these

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.060 
any information on that and then these
are<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.750> two<00:01:49.200> bundles<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:50.009> 16<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.450> see

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
are the two bundles of 16 as you can see

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.880 
are the two bundles of 16 as you can see
so<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.060> hair<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:55.140> soft

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so this up hair is really soft

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.560 
so this up hair is really soft
it<00:01:56.600> smells<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:58.909> pretty<00:01:59.909> much<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> hair<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
it smells like pretty much the hair that
you<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.930> off<00:02:01.049> Aliexpress<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> stuff

their<00:03:27.449> natural<00:03:27.720> hair<00:03:28.199> process<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:29.009> suppose<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
their natural hair process I suppose the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.770 
their natural hair process I suppose the
unprocessed<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.180> not<00:03:30.329> really<00:03:30.479> sure<00:03:30.720> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
unprocessed I'm not really sure I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.020 
unprocessed I'm not really sure I
suppose<00:03:30.959> fine<00:03:31.259> process<00:03:31.680> um<00:03:31.979> I<00:03:32.189> don't<00:03:32.699> know<00:03:32.909> if

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
suppose fine process um I don't know if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.339 
suppose fine process um I don't know if
you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.359> see<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.879> but<00:03:36.620> strength<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:40.109> on

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
you can see that but strength so but on

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.259 
you can see that but strength so but on
all<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:41.069> is<00:03:41.280> seems<00:03:42.150> pretty<00:03:42.329> good<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:45.979> will
