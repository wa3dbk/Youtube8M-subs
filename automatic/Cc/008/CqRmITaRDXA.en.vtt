in the game so you put four cubes of

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.200 
in the game so you put four cubes of
wood<00:02:36.209> together<00:02:36.389> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.019> you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
wood together and then you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.210 
wood together and then you
actually<00:02:37.450> create<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> workbench<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
actually create a workbench and on the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.490 
actually create a workbench and on the
workbench<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.970> where<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.480> create<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:41.440> of

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
workbench is where you create all of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.220 
workbench is where you create all of
your<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.460> know<00:02:42.580> your<00:02:42.610> apt<00:02:43.240> your<00:02:43.660> crafting

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
your you know your apt your crafting

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.590 
your you know your apt your crafting
things<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.070> then<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.970> create<00:02:46.300> like

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
things and then you can that create like

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.170 
things and then you can that create like
an<00:02:46.720> oven<00:02:46.930> meltdown<00:02:47.770> iron<00:02:48.160> mount<00:02:48.670> down<00:02:48.850> goals

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
an oven meltdown iron mount down goals

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.960 
an oven meltdown iron mount down goals
and<00:02:49.570> make<00:02:49.810> weapons<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.890> tools<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and make weapons and tools out of the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.550 
and make weapons and tools out of the
iron<00:02:52.150> that's<00:02:52.450> even<00:02:52.690> stronger<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.320> means

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
iron that's even stronger so that means

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980 
iron that's even stronger so that means
you<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.800> dig<00:02:54.040> through<00:02:54.640> more<00:02:54.820> plox<00:02:55.270> right<00:02:55.750> your

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
you can dig through more plox right your

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.140 
you can dig through more plox right your
weapons<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.710> your<00:02:57.070> tools<00:02:57.250> deplete<00:02:57.820> as<00:02:58.030> you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
weapons and your tools deplete as you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.280 
weapons and your tools deplete as you
use<00:02:58.330> them<00:02:58.540> they're<00:02:58.900> not<00:02:58.990> going<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.170> last

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
use them they're not going to last

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.980 
use them they're not going to last
forever<00:02:59.530> okay<00:03:00.010> every<00:03:00.760> time<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.060> dig<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.810> get

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
forever okay every time you dig you get

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.780 
forever okay every time you dig you get
an<00:03:02.230> extra<00:03:02.350> block<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.920> exactly<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.520> something

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
an extra block the exactly is something

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.250 
an extra block the exactly is something
else<00:03:03.940> exactly<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.750> guy<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.930> made<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
enterprise don't have to take crabbing

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.780 
enterprise don't have to take crabbing
yeah<00:03:07.060> yeah<00:03:07.750> oh<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.710> fully<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.580> little

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
yeah yeah oh it's fully and like little

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.850 
yeah yeah oh it's fully and like little
big<00:03:10.030> planet<00:03:10.060> things<00:03:11.050> are<00:03:11.230> very<00:03:11.380> simple<00:03:11.680> at

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
big planet things are very simple at

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.170 
big planet things are very simple at
first<00:03:11.920> making<00:03:12.430> these<00:03:12.640> things<00:03:12.820> but<00:03:12.940> then<00:03:13.090> you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
first making these things but then you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.450 
first making these things but then you
can<00:03:13.300> get<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:13.630> complex<00:03:14.200> computers<00:03:15.160> and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
can get to really complex computers and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.210 
can get to really complex computers and
make<00:03:15.730> TNT<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.660> saw<00:03:17.050> some<00:03:17.170> guy<00:03:17.500> micht<00:03:17.710> ENT<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
make TNT I saw some guy micht ENT and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.410 
make TNT I saw some guy micht ENT and
then<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.400> made<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.550> trail<00:03:18.910> red<00:03:19.360> rock<00:03:21.240> it's<00:03:22.240> also

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
then you made a trail red rock it's also

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.060 
then you made a trail red rock it's also
multiplayer<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.140> can<00:03:23.410> go<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.710> with<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
multiplayer so you can go on with a

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.950 
multiplayer so you can go on with a
friend<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.610> create<00:03:24.970> stuff<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.480> depends<00:03:25.870> on

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
friend and create stuff it depends on

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.840 
friend and create stuff it depends on
the<00:03:26.050> server<00:03:26.320> there's<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.130> could<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.400> massive

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the server there's it could be massive

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.580 
the server there's it could be massive
it<00:03:27.970> could<00:03:28.120> be<00:03:28.270> small<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.840> famous<00:03:29.410> video
