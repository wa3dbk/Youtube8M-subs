through day two and when in the only
bear<00:03:41.740> shade<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.190> think<00:03:42.340> we're<00:03:42.430> gonna<00:03:42.550> find<00:03:42.610> all

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
bear shade I think we're gonna find all

day long

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.210 
day long
find<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.960> quite<00:03:44.140> tough<00:03:44.440> what's<00:03:44.890> getting<00:03:45.040> ass

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
find it quite tough what's getting ass

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.130 
find it quite tough what's getting ass
most<00:03:45.460> I<00:03:45.580> think<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.000> how<00:03:46.120> hot<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.630> dry<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.960> is

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
most I think is is how hot and dry it is

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.510 
most I think is is how hot and dry it is
and<00:03:47.410> there<00:03:47.830> is<00:03:47.950> no<00:03:48.130> water

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
and there is no water

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.360 
and there is no water
that's<00:03:48.820> what<00:03:49.000> bench<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.300> all<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.660> parched
