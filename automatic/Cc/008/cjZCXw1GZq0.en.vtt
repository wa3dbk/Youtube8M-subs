just my idea of it I got it from eBay it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.330 
just my idea of it I got it from eBay it
was<00:02:40.670> $10<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.140> dark<00:02:42.410> brown<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.130> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
was $10 and it's a dark brown so the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.640 
was $10 and it's a dark brown so the
dark<00:02:43.580> brown<00:02:43.880> will<00:02:44.630> mix<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.020> with<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.410> which

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
dark brown will mix in with this which

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.750 
dark brown will mix in with this which
is<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.830> number<00:02:46.070> two<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.860> was<00:02:49.010> fast<00:02:49.280> shipping

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
at the computer and it's so hard it's so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.469 
at the computer and it's so hard it's so
much<00:04:57.479> easier<00:04:57.509> with<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:57.990> mirror<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.159> my<00:05:00.150> mirrors
