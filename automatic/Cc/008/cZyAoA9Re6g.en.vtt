00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 Let's work, let's connect the car. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 we're here to connect the flash drive 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.989
 light up because it works 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.969
 the father then worked in some time 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.079
 then I think the pay I have here 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 what to download is because the bike no longer has 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.239
 an explorer and I had to download and that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.629
 and come on, we have here 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.930
 the system memory of the phone and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 sbt memory says it wants memory 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.080
 it has several files like you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 You can see there then he has is and can 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.650
 read on 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 if I put here a micro adapter 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 usb 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.930
 He's going to get it , too. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 Let's see here. 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.119
 in the safety part this time is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 need to disconnect before before 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:37.430
 will get you from here to the neo capo more 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 usb disk storage 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.210
 disable usb storage otg on the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210
 Come on, let's go, guys. Let's go. 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 USB storage otter or is protect 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.930
 where is good some applications are not in use 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.030
 They will stop and were 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.680
 unavailable until you activate the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.409
 usb storage again ok 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.210
 storage will be removed I think 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.910
 can then be removed and can now 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.400
 remove without any problem with the staff 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.870
 then it already has an option below 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.590
 O 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.280
 Do not know, then you can. 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.080
 good connect let's now focus on a drive 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.290
 usb, right? 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.909
 It's kiko in the head with a drive here now. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:37.829
 already ascended to see that the screen 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:46.349
 where the mouse people do not have mouse 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:03:03.269
 q q will have grace he did not get the mouse 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:03:05.069
 people and now and now now now goes 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.120
 win another name has something I 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.120
 I do not think so, not personally. 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.010
 to the one but I always with background that is 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.739
 also different than a 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:26.790
 there's nothing to talk about here usb connected 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:29.340
 and did not show anything to disconnect 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.060
 here and let's connect again let's go 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.879
 see what will happen 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.980
 on and not the mouse does not pick staff is 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.950
 Of course I certainly think that it will catch. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.090
 plus the mouse it turns on but does not recognize 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.410
 a personal mouse 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.230
 the usb recognizes the pendrive 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.199
 recognize and have an adapter 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.780
 micro usb also certainly certainly 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:59.040
 I would also certainly recognize ok 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.599
 or the connector to protect it 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 it works so that it has until 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.859
 option here 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.260
 nuno moto g2 personal touch this if you 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.919
 I liked the lady, thank you so much and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.919
