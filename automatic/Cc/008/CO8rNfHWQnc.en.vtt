00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
i think i'll make up some random numbers

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.190 
i think i'll make up some random numbers
they<00:02:23.590> could<00:02:23.800> be<00:02:24.250> ten<00:02:24.970> cents<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.510> pound<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.960> next

day one day then be two dollars out of
the<00:02:28.780> next<00:02:28.990> day<00:02:29.110> then<00:02:29.490> five<00:02:30.490> for<00:02:30.970> ten<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:32.140> next

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
the next day then five for ten the next

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.790 
the next day then five for ten the next
day<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.360> five<00:02:34.990> cents<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.620> pound

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.310 
day and then back to five cents a pound
and<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:37.060> crazy<00:02:37.450> they<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.900> no<00:02:38.050> idea

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
and then it is crazy they have no idea
