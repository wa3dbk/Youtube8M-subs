is a bit soft at the moment I think I
need<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.219> adjust<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.239> few<00:00:33.570> bits<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.079> track

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
need to adjust a few bits for this track

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.420 
need to adjust a few bits for this track
but<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> mean<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.940> no<00:00:37.100> temp<00:00:38.100> scale

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

that on or don't do it at all so it's
taken<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> few<00:00:51.840> crashes<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
taken a few crashes like that I just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.830 
taken a few crashes like that I just
given<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> control<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:53.820> son<00:00:54.090> who<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.420> 10

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
given the control to my son who is 10

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790 
given the control to my son who is 10
and<00:00:55.250> he's<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:57.000> big<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> big<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and he's going to be a much big so big a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.819 
and he's going to be a much big so big a
test<00:00:59.270> of<00:01:00.270> its<00:01:00.420> durability<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.559> he's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
test of its durability because he's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.080 
test of its durability because he's
going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> crash<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.520> than<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.760> although

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
going to crash it more than me although

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.660 
going to crash it more than me although
I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.420> he's<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.930> slower<00:01:04.170> than<00:01:04.350> me<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
I think he's gonna go slower than me but

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.810 
I think he's gonna go slower than me but
maybe<00:01:05.670> he<00:01:05.850> won't<00:01:05.970> we'll<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.409> but<00:01:07.409> um<00:01:07.590> yeah<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
maybe he won't we'll see but um yeah the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
maybe he won't we'll see but um yeah the
suspension<00:01:09.390> action<00:01:09.659> seems<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.200> nice<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
suspension action seems really nice and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.510 
suspension action seems really nice and
smooth<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:12.229> stock<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.979> Chief<00:01:14.310> ho

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
smooth for stock you know Chief ho

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.080 
smooth for stock you know Chief ho
shocks<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> quick<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.369> obviously<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
shocks it's quick but obviously that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
shocks it's quick but obviously that
depends<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> system<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
depends on the system you put in it so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
depends on the system you put in it so
you<00:01:20.060> know<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> guess<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> irrelevant

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you know that I guess is irrelevant

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.929 
you know that I guess is irrelevant
really<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> case<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> kit<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
really but in this case it was the kit I

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.990 
really but in this case it was the kit I
don't<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.210> else<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.650> nice

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
don't know what else can I say nice

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.780 
don't know what else can I say nice
that's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.180> better<00:01:30.329> nice

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
that's a lot better nice

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.940 
that's a lot better nice
it<00:01:32.300> seems<00:01:32.660> quite<00:01:32.900> easy<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.170> drive<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.770> mean

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950

surviving<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.620> far<00:02:21.870> yeah<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.459> generally

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459

surviving so far yeah I just generally
I'm<00:02:24.640> impressed<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.020> for<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
I'm impressed with it I like it for the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.290 
I'm impressed with it I like it for the
price<00:02:26.680> i<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.849> get<00:02:27.970> into<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
price i think if you want to get into a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.500 
price i think if you want to get into a
bit<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:29.220> buggies<00:02:30.220> i<00:02:30.250> think<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> could<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.150> some

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
bit of buggies i think you could do some

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.800 
bit of buggies i think you could do some
racing<00:02:31.660> with<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.140> i<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:33.300> i've<00:02:34.300> gotta<00:02:34.660> be

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
racing with this i think i've gotta be

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.740 
racing with this i think i've gotta be
44<00:02:35.349> here<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.769> an<00:02:35.860> old<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.190> 44<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:36.849> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
44 here and it's an old be 44 but and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.640 
44 here and it's an old be 44 but and
that's<00:02:38.530> nice<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.310> very<00:02:39.610> nimble<00:02:39.819> and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that's nice but this is very nimble and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.320 
that's nice but this is very nimble and
i'm<00:02:41.650> interested<00:02:42.310> very<00:02:42.489> interested<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.940> get<00:02:43.150> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
i'm interested very interested to get it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.479 
i'm interested very interested to get it
on<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:45.330> on<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.650> mid<00:02:47.650> by<00:02:47.830> yourself<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> is

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
on the on the mid by yourself this is

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.640 
on the on the mid by yourself this is
rear<00:02:48.700> motor<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.360> midnight<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.319> might<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.620> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
rear motor and midnight it might be a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.729 
rear motor and midnight it might be a
bit<00:02:50.769> more<00:02:50.920> neutral<00:02:51.450> less<00:02:52.450> rear<00:02:52.810> ND<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.530> that

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
bit more neutral less rear ND like that

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.340 
bit more neutral less rear ND like that
when<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.069> in<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.220> air<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.120> know<00:02:55.350> easier

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
when it's in the air so you know easier

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.920 
when it's in the air so you know easier
to<00:02:56.500> keep<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.190> car<00:02:58.090> level<00:02:58.450> maybe<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
to keep the the car level maybe in the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.650 
to keep the the car level maybe in the
air<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.170> we'll<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.500> I<00:03:00.269> will<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> mid

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
air but we'll see I will do the mid

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.140 
air but we'll see I will do the mid
motor<00:03:01.840> conversion<00:03:02.349> soon<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.910> how<00:03:04.030> it
