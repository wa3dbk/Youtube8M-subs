00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
there's 22 years of technology

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.110 
there's 22 years of technology
keep<00:00:15.760> up<00:00:15.940> with<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.420> mean

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
keep up with I mean

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.820 
keep up with I mean
yeah<00:00:17.660> design<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.110> different

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
yeah design is different

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
yeah design is different
the<00:00:20.310> older<00:00:20.550> ones<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:20.940> was<00:00:21.030> a<00:00:21.060> separation

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the older ones there was a separation

with<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> newer<00:01:07.170> technology<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.860> came<00:01:08.009> up

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
with the newer technology they came up

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.249 
with the newer technology they came up
with<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> role<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> doors<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> there's<00:01:10.200> no

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
with the role of doors so there's no

with the role of doors so there's no
chance<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.799> people<00:01:11.460> running<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:11.880> doors<00:01:12.149> or

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
chance of people running into doors or

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.330 
chance of people running into doors or
have<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> door<00:01:12.750> come<00:01:12.899> down<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.320> top<00:01:13.500> oh<00:01:13.829> yeah

have the door come down on top oh yeah

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
have the door come down on top oh yeah
because<00:01:15.180> there's<00:01:15.390> times<00:01:15.659> where<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> gets<00:01:16.110> cold

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because there's times where it gets cold
