going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> smash<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.080> up<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.520> carrots<00:02:19.790> are

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
going to smash it up so the carrots are

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.400 
going to smash it up so the carrots are
boiled<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.720> add<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> little<00:02:21.140> bit<00:02:21.350> of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
boiled and you just add a little bit of

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.430 
boiled and you just add a little bit of
brown<00:02:21.650> sugar<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.510> usually<00:02:24.290> add<00:02:24.410> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
brown sugar to it and I usually add a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.890 
brown sugar to it and I usually add a
little<00:02:24.680> bit<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.920> butter<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.780> little

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
little bit of butter so it's a little

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.020 
little bit of butter so it's a little
bit<00:02:27.020> runny<00:02:27.320> right<00:02:27.590> now<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.730> to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
bit runny right now so you just have to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.740 
bit runny right now so you just have to
