when you guys are crouching you guys are
basically<00:00:35.190> head<00:00:35.370> glitching<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
basically head glitching so this can be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically head glitching so this can be
very<00:00:36.960> useful<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.350> other<00:00:37.500> game<00:00:38.010> modes<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.640> you
