to<00:00:44.540> eventually<00:00:45.080> develop<00:00:45.530> into<00:00:45.860> maybe<00:00:46.130> a<00:00:46.490> a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
to eventually develop into maybe a a

pass-first high point guard who could
actually<00:00:49.370> contribute<00:00:50.060> to<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.300> team<00:00:50.480> concept

giving<00:01:38.900> him<00:01:38.960> all<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.229> coverage<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.830> he

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
giving him all this coverage and he

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.649 
giving him all this coverage and he
legitimately<00:01:40.549> just<00:01:41.060> came<00:01:41.240> out<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.540> said

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
legitimately just came out and said

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.320 
legitimately just came out and said
recently<00:01:41.900> he<00:01:42.620> wants<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.920> be<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> sixth<00:01:43.460> man<00:01:43.640> why

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
recently he wants to be a sixth man why

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.789 
recently he wants to be a sixth man why
do<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.540> think<00:01:44.630> he<00:01:44.840> wants<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.080> be<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.260> sixth<00:01:45.619> man

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
do you think he wants to be a sixth man

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.710 
do you think he wants to be a sixth man
so<00:01:46.460> he<00:01:46.549> could<00:01:46.700> come<00:01:46.880> off<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.180> bench<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.479> jack

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
so he could come off the bench and jack

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.050 
so he could come off the bench and jack
up<00:01:47.900> shots<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:49.280> don't<00:01:49.520> know<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:49.700> he'll<00:01:49.909> ever

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
up shots I just don't know if he'll ever

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.770 
up shots I just don't know if he'll ever
develop<00:01:50.659> into<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.020> true<00:01:51.470> force<00:01:52.400> as<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.729> starter<00:01:53.299> I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
develop into a true force as a starter I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.930 
develop into a true force as a starter I
I<00:01:54.260> question<00:01:55.040> everything<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.670> I've<00:01:55.760> already

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
I question everything that I've already

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.920 
I question everything that I've already
named<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.600> dumb<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:58.670> think<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:58.939> he's<00:01:59.900> a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
named and dumb I just think that he's a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.070 
named and dumb I just think that he's a
shoot<00:02:00.320> first<00:02:00.560> player<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.689> he's<00:02:02.689> not<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.900> very

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
shoot first player and he's not a very

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.070 
shoot first player and he's not a very
good<00:02:03.200> defender<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.729> one<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.240> two<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.930> I

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
good defender the one the the two that I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.359 
good defender the one the the two that I
guess<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.409> one<00:02:06.590> thing<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.890> I'll<00:02:07.100> give<00:02:07.250> him

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
guess the one thing that I'll give him

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.919 
guess the one thing that I'll give him
credit<00:02:07.580> for<00:02:07.939> is<00:02:08.030> he<00:02:08.119> doesn't<00:02:08.479> turn<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.750> ball

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
credit for is he doesn't turn the ball

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.110 
credit for is he doesn't turn the ball
over<00:02:08.959> all<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.560> much<00:02:09.770> but<00:02:10.490> for<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.789> most<00:02:10.970> part

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
over all that much but for the most part

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.059 
over all that much but for the most part
he<00:02:11.480> doesn't<00:02:11.810> contribute<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> key<00:02:12.770> team

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
he doesn't contribute to the key team

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.230 
he doesn't contribute to the key team
concept<00:02:13.640> so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
concept so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.150 
concept so
I<00:02:14.300> do<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:14.960> being<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.200> sixth<00:02:15.530> man<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> best

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I do think being a sixth man is the best

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.830 
I do think being a sixth man is the best
option<00:02:16.460> or<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> guy<00:02:17.030> who<00:02:17.090> comes<00:02:17.390> off<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.600> bench

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
option or a guy who comes off the bench

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.710 
option or a guy who comes off the bench
and<00:02:18.110> puts<00:02:18.770> up<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.980> few<00:02:19.190> shots<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.700> game<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:20.600> I

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
and puts up a few shots a game but I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120 
and puts up a few shots a game but I
don't<00:02:20.900> know<00:02:20.990> if<00:02:21.080> he'll<00:02:21.200> ever<00:02:21.320> develop<00:02:21.830> into<00:02:22.100> a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
don't know if he'll ever develop into a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.460 
don't know if he'll ever develop into a
real<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.850> know<00:02:22.970> good<00:02:23.600> starter<00:02:24.050> quality

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
real you know good starter quality

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.190 
real you know good starter quality
starter<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.550> because<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.810> that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
starter just because I don't think that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.770 
starter just because I don't think that
he<00:02:27.680> has<00:02:27.860> here<00:02:28.340> when<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.090> pertains<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.690> way

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
he has here when it pertains to the way

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.360 
he has here when it pertains to the way
that<00:02:29.990> he<00:02:30.080> approaches<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> team<00:02:30.950> game<00:02:31.220> of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that he approaches the team game of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.270 
that he approaches the team game of
basketball<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:33.260> also<00:02:33.500> don't<00:02:33.890> think<00:02:34.070> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
basketball and I also don't think that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.420 
basketball and I also don't think that
he<00:02:34.550> has<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.970> abilities<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.900> become<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.980> force

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
he has the abilities to become a force

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.740 
he has the abilities to become a force
as<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.850> shoot<00:02:38.420> first<00:02:38.630> player<00:02:38.990> anyways<00:02:39.470> um<00:02:40.750> he's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
as a shoot first player anyways um he's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.810 
as a shoot first player anyways um he's
just<00:02:42.020> not<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.230> good<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.190> don't<00:02:43.400> understand

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
just not that good so I don't understand

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.090 
just not that good so I don't understand
the<00:02:43.940> medial<00:02:44.300> up<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.780> him<00:02:44.870> other<00:02:45.380> than<00:02:45.560> he<00:02:45.950> had
