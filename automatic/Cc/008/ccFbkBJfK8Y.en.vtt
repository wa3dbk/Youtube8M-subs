00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
pieces together but what I would suggest

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.739 
pieces together but what I would suggest
is<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.740> notch<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.880> use<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.389> tool

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
it's by Wilton and the reason why I

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.129 
it's by Wilton and the reason why I
prefer<00:01:44.609> this<00:01:44.999> one<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.359> because<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> smaller

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
prefer this one is because it's smaller

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.249 
prefer this one is because it's smaller
and<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.950> cuter<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> want<00:01:48.929> you<00:01:49.109> to

and is just cuter so what I want you to
do<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.130> point<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.759> basically<00:01:51.389> just<00:01:51.719> go

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
do to this point is basically just go

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
do to this point is basically just go
all<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:53.280> way<00:01:53.310> around<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:54.119> piece<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:56.479> see

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
all the way around your piece and see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
all the way around your piece and see
how<00:01:57.659> cute<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.139> is<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
how cute this is and it's going to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.039 
how cute this is and it's going to
create<00:02:00.139> just<00:02:01.139> a<00:02:01.319> nice<00:02:01.560> cute<00:02:02.009> effect<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.749> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
create just a nice cute effect as if it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:22.560 
create just a nice cute effect as if it
was<00:02:04.350> sewed

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.360 

and<00:02:23.570> there<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.800> an<00:02:24.980> entire

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
and there you go you have an entire

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 
and there you go you have an entire
place<00:02:25.850> readiness<00:02:26.360> are<00:02:26.600> done<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.770> let

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
place readiness are done and you let

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.360 
place readiness are done and you let
them<00:02:28.160> set<00:02:28.640> aside<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.450> least<00:02:29.600> half<00:02:29.960> an<00:02:30.170> hour

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
them set aside for at least half an hour

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.950 
them set aside for at least half an hour
the<00:02:31.370> reason<00:02:31.670> why<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:32.630> they

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the reason why I do that is because they

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040 
the reason why I do that is because they
come<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> little<00:02:33.410> bit<00:02:33.710> harder<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.450> easier

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
come a little bit harder and it's easier

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.340 
come a little bit harder and it's easier
to<00:02:36.350> mold<00:02:36.940> into<00:02:37.940> your<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.750> bottom<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.290> your

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
to mold into your the bottom of your

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.610 
to mold into your the bottom of your
shoe<00:02:39.890> look-see<00:02:40.820> your<00:02:41.060> shoe<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.720> already

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
shoe look-see your shoe is already

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.360 
shoe look-see your shoe is already
getting<00:02:43.040> harder<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.950> easier<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.070> work

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
getting harder so it's easier to work

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.020 
getting harder so it's easier to work
