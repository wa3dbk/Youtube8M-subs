00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
it's just it's just appearing and then I

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.569 
it's just it's just appearing and then I
don't<00:00:35.530> think<00:00:35.710> it's<00:00:35.860> going<00:00:36.040> to<00:00:36.160> disappear

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
don't think it's going to disappear

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.010 
don't think it's going to disappear
because<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:36.940> tell<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.180> what<00:00:37.300> is<00:00:37.420> fucking<00:00:37.780> grey

because I tell you what is fucking grey
but<00:00:38.800> I'm<00:00:39.220> starting<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.760> suspect<00:00:39.970> that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
but I'm starting to suspect that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.910 
but I'm starting to suspect that
Nintendo<00:00:40.840> using<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.350> as<00:00:41.440> an<00:00:41.500> experiment

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
Nintendo using it as an experiment

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.120 
Nintendo using it as an experiment
because<00:00:42.430> it's<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.560> online<00:00:44.890> functionality

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
because it's it the online functionality

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.200 
because it's it the online functionality
it<00:00:45.760> might<00:00:46.030> as<00:00:46.150> well<00:00:46.330> as<00:00:46.420> be<00:00:46.570> on<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.260> 360<00:00:48.210> within

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
it might as well as be on the 360 within

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.720 
it might as well as be on the 360 within
five<00:00:50.080> minutes<00:00:50.320> when<00:00:50.560> I<00:00:50.650> win<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:51.190> mean<00:00:51.490> within

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
five minutes when I win I mean within

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.340 
five minutes when I win I mean within
two<00:00:52.090> minutes<00:00:52.330> that<00:00:52.540> we<00:00:52.630> turn<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.990> on<00:00:53.080> for<00:00:53.260> the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
two minutes that we turn it on for the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.080 
two minutes that we turn it on for the
