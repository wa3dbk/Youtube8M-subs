00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.699
 for its short duration and large 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.380
 results you can lose 1 to 4 kilos 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.490

 Weighed 67 kilos with 700 grams at the end 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.949

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.750
 that I lose a kilo 700 grams can not 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.640
 look a lot like this was in three days 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.559
 and normally what I get in a 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.510
 week taking care of my invitation action 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.129
 Exercise is one kilo to be able to measure 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.910
 better results to me I also like 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.920
 measure me when starting the average diet 81.5 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.110
 centimeters of waist that is the part 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.600
 thinnest of my abdomen and part 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.809
 widest of fear ' men that is not the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.870
 hip but precision of the most part 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.850
 I feel like I have more chubby is 90 and 1.5 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 centimeters at the end of the average diet 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.789

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.320
 wider part 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.600
 so lower a centimeter and a half 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.710
 in the three days of the diet and this already 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.030
 You can do it as many times as 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.399
 you want necessary however it is 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.050
 important to wait a week between each 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.630

 green plant taking into account the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.620

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.510
 calories 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.220

 any other cookie that is not sweet 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.340
 but you have to take into account 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.110
 calories without squares of cookies 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.120
