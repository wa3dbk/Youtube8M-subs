of that new research affected your
perspective<00:00:31.880> since<00:00:32.390> you've<00:00:32.540> written<00:00:32.720> that

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
perspective since you've written that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.590 
perspective since you've written that
book<00:00:32.930> well<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.040> book<00:00:34.220> came<00:00:34.370> out<00:00:34.520> in<00:00:34.580> 2009<00:00:35.360> and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
book well the book came out in 2009 and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.720 
book well the book came out in 2009 and
then<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.780> paperback<00:00:36.230> was<00:00:36.379> released<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:36.890> 2010

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
then the paperback was released in 2010

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.619 
then the paperback was released in 2010
and<00:00:38.470> one<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.860> arguments<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.730> made<00:00:40.970> near<00:00:41.480> the

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
and one of the arguments I made near the

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.960 
and one of the arguments I made near the
end<00:00:41.660> of<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.930> book<00:00:42.140> was<00:00:42.440> not<00:00:42.590> just<00:00:42.800> about<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
end of the book was not just about the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.670 
end of the book was not just about the
basics<00:00:44.390> of<00:00:44.480> molecular<00:00:44.930> biology<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.500> fact
