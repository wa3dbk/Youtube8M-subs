are<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.100> too<00:02:37.340> much<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.850> game<00:02:38.000> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
are just too much for the game and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.120 
are just too much for the game and
they'll<00:02:38.720> just<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:39.260> too<00:02:39.410> overpowered<00:02:39.860> really

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
they'll just be too overpowered really

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949

but<00:02:40.370> personally<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.180> got<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> way<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.569> use<00:02:41.810> them

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959

the bottom right there so it's
definitely<00:03:26.660> legit<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.859> looks<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
definitely legit it looks like the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.830 
definitely legit it looks like the
killstreak<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.239> same<00:03:29.510> as

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
killstreak is going to be the same as

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.080 
killstreak is going to be the same as
lack<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.709> accept<00:03:31.220> they've<00:03:31.340> got<00:03:31.430> two<00:03:31.670> extra

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
lack of to accept they've got two extra

lack of to accept they've got two extra
ones<00:03:32.329> added<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:32.720> at<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.930> end<00:03:33.079> which<00:03:33.380> are<00:03:33.560> Simon

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
ones added on at the end which are Simon

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.160 
ones added on at the end which are Simon
Cowell<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.400> cats<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.329> don't<00:03:35.600> know<00:03:35.690> if<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> cats

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
Cowell and cats I don't know if the cats

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.569 
Cowell and cats I don't know if the cats
are<00:03:36.260> going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> be<00:03:36.620> similar<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.160> attack

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
are going to be similar to the attack

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.310 
are going to be similar to the attack
dogs<00:03:37.820> killstreak<00:03:38.299> because<00:03:38.690> as<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.079> can<00:03:39.200> see

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
dogs killstreak because as you can see

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.140 
dogs killstreak because as you can see
in<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.470> picture<00:03:39.709> there's<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> log<00:03:40.820> that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
in this picture there's like a log that

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.819 
in this picture there's like a log that
one<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.420> cats<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.690> sitting<00:03:42.049> on<00:03:42.140> maybe<00:03:42.650> it's

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
one of the cats is sitting on maybe it's

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.229 
one of the cats is sitting on maybe it's
going<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.010> be<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.130> killstreak<00:03:43.489> we<00:03:43.700> just<00:03:43.940> put

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
going to be a killstreak we just put

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.240 
going to be a killstreak we just put
down<00:03:44.359> to<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.660> floor<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.650> defends

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
down to the floor and it just defends

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.550 
down to the floor and it just defends
around<00:03:46.549> it<00:03:46.730> like<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.390> sentry<00:03:47.870> gun<00:03:48.049> or<00:03:48.290> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
around it like the sentry gun or the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.319 
around it like the sentry gun or the
Guardian<00:03:49.100> from<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.519> screenshot<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.150> looks

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
Guardian from the screenshot it looks

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.970 
Guardian from the screenshot it looks
like<00:03:50.510> salmon<00:03:50.870> Cal<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.140> going<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.350> be<00:03:51.470> easier<00:03:51.829> to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
like salmon Cal is going to be easier to

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.340 
like salmon Cal is going to be easier to
get<00:03:52.130> learn<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.880> cats<00:03:53.090> which<00:03:53.480> i<00:03:53.870> think<00:03:53.989> is

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
get learn the cats which i think is

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.559 
get learn the cats which i think is
surprising<00:03:55.070> since<00:03:55.400> Simon<00:03:55.670> Carly's<00:03:56.060> obviously

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
surprising since Simon Carly's obviously

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.900 
surprising since Simon Carly's obviously
extremely<00:03:56.989> powerful<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:58.370> think<00:03:58.819> he's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
extremely powerful and I think he's

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.880 
extremely powerful and I think he's
gonna<00:03:59.000> be<00:03:59.120> overpowered<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.959> hopefully<00:04:00.799> they

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
gonna be overpowered so hopefully they

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.470 
gonna be overpowered so hopefully they
never<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.370> little<00:04:01.609> bit<00:04:01.760> make<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.209> little<00:04:02.299> bit

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
never a little bit make it a little bit

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.780 
never a little bit make it a little bit
weaker<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.109> people<00:04:03.739> don't<00:04:03.920> over<00:04:04.190> use<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.609> or

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
weaker so people don't over use it or

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.640 
weaker so people don't over use it or
maybe<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:05.329> make<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.690> harder<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.109> get<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.560> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
maybe just make it harder to get in the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.349 
maybe just make it harder to get in the
game<00:04:06.799> this<00:04:07.130> next<00:04:07.459> screenshot<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.269> the
