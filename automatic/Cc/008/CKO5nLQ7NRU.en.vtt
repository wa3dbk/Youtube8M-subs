00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 where do we go 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.860
 this is our maternity ward 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 in summer she looks so quietly whitewashed 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.550
 Now replace the sand that's what I 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 prescribed wanted to tell it as if 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.670
 all firms we build are very important 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.170
 on the hills of us and who themselves created 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.840
 we pour about a meter and a half from sand 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.480
 in the tape foundation the device is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 a farm and a map every spring from and to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.109
 races where our animals stand each 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.120
 spring is all manure is being dredged and together 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.969
 a piece of sand about 10 centimeters 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.249
 sand leaves with manure and 10 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 centimeters we fall asleep new and all 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:02.069
 walls all this further here is divided into here 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 As a hospital should be 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:08.340
 about six seven months then there is still 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 today uterus will come in the month of November 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.040
 right here and no more 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 and there are no pens and they all together or 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 partitions 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.539
 You see this foundation is not a city 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.810
 here the cells will be about 15 ma so 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.430
 I understood it for everyone 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 the door is the door 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 this is the next pen here this bar here 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 so here partition off and the partition and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.320
 here it is one cell 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 I realized this is the door and the following income 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530
 snoopers 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.979
 but in order to clean these dung 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.320
 cells are removed these partitions 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.250
 like that 2 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.830
 and here is the depth of this sand 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.979
 depth height height up to one and a half meters 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.010
 one and a half meter of sand is poured first 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.850
 home one and a half registration on this hill 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 erected it all steel straight right 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.900
 on right on the sand at an hour we will go by 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.120
 is building there everything will be more 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.820
 view and no litter more than another 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.030
 no it is what it is here they are written 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.730
 on the sand and fight up all this gender I'm 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.880
 there whipped up to drag it goes 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 they still pull hay in the spring she 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.420
 approximately to the end of the concrete using this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.790
 centimeters 35 40 tarps bedding 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.610
 It is clear to hay with everyone this bedding 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.790
 bulldozer is not the day from here and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.100
 since dragging along with it with 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.580
 litter together takes about a part 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.890
 sand about 10 10 centimeters here 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.380
 no bacteria you see no none 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.330
 there is nothing here alone 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.640
 the main thing is that lambs as soon as they 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.180
 born not picked up any 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.900
 an infection 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.690
 if they got sick dad wears nothing with 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.000
 they will no longer reveal them all but if 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.130
 then compare the gray cheese with these they 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.640
 behind forever you understand weeks 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.310
 illnesses in childhood he has fallen behind forever 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.310
 do not agree with this if 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.250
 there is an era of waste well, as it were, according to the standards 5 7 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.690
 percent we have waste 2 percent this this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.900
 mostly at birth 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.840
 obstetric arrangement of course nothing 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.070
 don't do it when you come in and lie 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.380
 the whole department of the harvest did not find someone coming and 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.040
 ask need to help someone say so 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.790
 some kind of problem here as if 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.060
 there is a loss 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.519
 I understood when sorry and such that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.799
 interrupted and such premises you still build 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.640
 so we have four now building 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.170
 26 more rooms per thousand inscriptions 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.850
 macro 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.459
 one-time and chase when every 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.199
 room about 200 mm from here it is 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.019
 how would we have a little bit in length here 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.160
 somewhere around 250 ma there will be one thing shorter 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.240
 150 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.620
 well ka i get started here here like 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.480
 everything would depend on the front feeding like 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.549
 I would be clear on what should be and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.360
 square meters but the main front 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.100
 feeding 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.709
 here should be on every brand 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.580
 half a meter of front 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.340
 three options becomes cell as it were 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 escada they have not given birth to them for free 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.780
 well when they give birth and a month later lambs 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.910
 too will start to eat to the beads 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.960
 Here is this manger it serves and for 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.820
 feed 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.760
 right there pouring right here this 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 dosochka and such as a trough and at the same 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.520
 time here is a width 13 and a half 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:54.710
 centimeters and this will be calculated 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.360
 you can not do already not get through the head 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.120
 you can not make shire 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.780
 they will be free to hang out and carry 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.770
 here hay 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.770
 these 13 centimeters and such 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.140
 optimal optimally calculated our 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.970
 Life prompted and done already done 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.590
 wider thing but this is what you need 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.380
 we say the most ventilation is the simplest 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.180
 but at the same time it was dry in winter 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.730
 to have enough air you need just that 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.120
 such a blizzard and the whole mine is insulated to 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.970
 from there water dripped nothing and the ceiling 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.940
 insulated walls insulated 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.570
 if if wrinkles and all the whole work 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:45.620
 the fan depends on let you and 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.430
 the end well, that is, it is understandable blocked it 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.390
 blocked people no any 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:56.480
 systematically and goes early here lantern pav 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.360
 anal roof yes and air flow 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.430
 where from the door or experience are they 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.500
 open air flow on such 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.900
 indoors the sea ​​of ​​any and the door is brought 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.750
 food opens every day so here 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.970
 problems with air flow is not so she 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:19.100
 open until about -15 it's warm outside 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.490
 the option is enough here just so as not to 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.460
 the water did not freeze like they themselves 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.660
 afraid of the cold is to shield or mean 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.600
 tractor delivers food 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.370
 lest he break the water supply it 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.470
 made a fence but this farm 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.020
 cost 15 years ago was external 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.600
 always so this now I now you 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.650
 you will see the whole tube coming right 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.110
 here is the foundation 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.990
 now we no longer have water 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.790
 We are not building a farm in advance 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.010
 water here in the middle of the foundation 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.190
 we leave and yes even it is not necessary and so we 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.500
 brought out thought here to handy you 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.870
 It was at hand ended so that he 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.710
 freak opened and ran into this pipe 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.930
 all plastic you fountain here but 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.320
 As I understand this problem often 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.660
 It solved here but it's a piece of iron excess 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:15.460
 but natural things and but on this 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.460
 I do n't see the solution, I see all these myself
