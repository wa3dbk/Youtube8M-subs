00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.850
 in if we reason c 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.340
 batista70phone friends another one of the 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.289
 samsung novelty the samsung gear feat 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.689
 We are talking about 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.939
 practically as the name of also says 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.630
 a clock we say dedicated to fitness 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.719
 is a super amoled and tea curved display 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.540
 water and dust and resistant with 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:35.120
 ip67 certification can be integrated 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.789
 with the various functions performed 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 and whatever else we go to see we have 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.629
 here the part concerning the notifications le 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.480
 notifications for example there are 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.760
 notifications we certainly don't have the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.500
 multimedia control we can do 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.170
 start a song and it will start directly 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.750
 here we can send ahead to the next 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.899
 song we can stop we can 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.159
 working on the volume we can raise it e 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.610
 everything happens in a manner 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:08.869
 almost instantaneously on our phone 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.030
 what else we have the research the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.250
 device when we don't know where not 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.149
 we remember where we put it 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.490
 we do the research and he 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.649
 automatically starts playing or 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.240
 anyway to vibrate so that we 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.770
 we have the opportunity to visit 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.720
 our device once 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.000
 we found obviously we go to 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.380
 turn off this function 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.479
 what else we still have the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.100
 pedometer exercise frequency 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.450
 these obviously not me cardiac 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 I can show why right now 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.200
 we should take to start walking 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.590
 around the room and it doesn't seem like the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.009
 case 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.340
 we have an exercise break must them 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.410
 walking and running cycling and others 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.119
 then what else do we have a frequency 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.310
 heart 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.710
 then we put it on the wrist 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.650
 put it also backwards 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.590
 we put a problem on our wrist 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.729
 and let's see our frequency 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.380
 cardiac in this case we do sta 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.130
 mediating and seeing the frequency 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.540
 cardiac 75 76 we say that to be a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.970
 old man is absolutely nothing 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.610
 badly given the day after a moment ago 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.350
 an average and will average you 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.780
 your heart rate takes a 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.700
 momentino we are playing now 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.250
 going up we say that we have an 89 of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.750
 heart rate I have to say that I don't 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.800
 it's absolutely okay for the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.300
 workouts 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.250
 for example for background training 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.140
 to keep the frequency under control 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.200
 our heart rate 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.870
 we have timer as you can 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.660
 see we can set a time within 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.730
 which we say 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.820
 a kind of countdown we have the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.820
 stopwatch 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.660
 you see everything very fast we have the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.640
 possibility to change Spanish though 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.440
 we understand it very well kind of watch 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have different types of watches like 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.850
 you can also see with a lot of weather 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.050
 nice fund we can change it 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.720
 background you see we have several e 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.360
 this for example the type of pan size 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.210
 what's his name 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.790
 the spot let's say we can go to 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.680
 change various things I would like everything 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.610
 Spanish I don't know how to settle it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.470
 tongue 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 we display the battery 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.280
 attack 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.470
 all or we do the reset that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.989
 to say is a really great tool 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.030
 interesting because both as watch 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.769
 very nice very fashion and then it is 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.900
 really very helpful with regards 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.580
 the finished part I must say that 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.099
 honestly I really like this 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.250
 much also on an aesthetic level 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:41.300
 aesthetically really nice comfortable 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.350
 light that is very useful 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.060
 word more 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.310
 more apt that my name is in this 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.680
 moment and with this we have concluded the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.660
 salute of the variety lucio always from the
