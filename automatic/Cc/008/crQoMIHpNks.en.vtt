 of if it will get that the bear that is the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.929
 that explains it, I'm not going to explain 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.209
 every time I make a video tutorial 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.640
 about how he gets pokemon I'm not going to 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.899
 explain everything because it is the same 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 exactly right now in life 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.560
 explained in five videos how to do 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.030
 something that is the same reason why if not 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.430
 you know how to get it 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.289
 see the video of the jockey also what 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.810
 I'll leave in the description of the video that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.569
 it is equal to what you have to do to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.459
 get this year colleagues you have 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.910
 to do just the same as in the 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.250
 broth video only just that instead of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.690
 that the dow are going to get the che and me 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 it invaded color but the step is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.510
 exactly as I have repeated 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.069
 previously also as I said already 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 two or three times I am very heavy 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.320
 I want this to be quite gay grade 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.090
 I will leave the instructions in the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.390
 description of the video and the point file 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.780
 pokemon that the jamie rise to mega 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.910
 by myself another thing I wanted to say 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.850
 is that the archives by time that we have 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.930
 I get them on my own, not what 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.540
 with him 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.220
 I am the one that two I am the one that I upload 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 to some not some new ones there but 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.180
 well let me not explain it I am the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.000
 that gets them, it's me who take me 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 my time to get them and not what 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.420
 no one's copy is worth what this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.959
 be clear why 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.200
 this this told me with jorge villanueva 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.140
 I want that I was created that I do not 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.640
 copied from nobody says copion of shit 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.650
 this is from SeÃ±or Jones or is already 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.650
 youtube denounced mouth but you 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180
 closes the general for copy failures 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.790
 to begin with, I'm not copying from 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.760
 nobody because I had this in mind 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.220
 for quite some time and if um and if 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.870
 for whatever it is someone more famous fell 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 or someone who uploads more famous videos 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 fell down does this just me no no no no 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.280
 is that it is more and I did not know what 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.370
 Lord God, I'm subscribed to your channel 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.590
 for this he sees some videos we can not see 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.019
 everything and I did not know he was 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.150
 doing this and anyway this 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.549
 I had planned for a long time and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.980
 age way still the point files 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.440
 pokemon as I say again not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.090
 got of the Lord gods day tour I 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.700
 I'll make a video Adam Park 9 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.670
 this video I understand nothing 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.440
 This is the lord of the sun do not do that 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.440
 I do not do that 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.510
 it's more changing, I think he does not 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.430
 did any video to get me this 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.870
 It is various color so this 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.530
 shows that I'm not copying from 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.550
 nobody and that got it from myself 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.550
 it's worth it, this has been everything but 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.950
 it is clear the instructions I leave 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.930
 the description of the video the file 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.610
 together because also and if you do not have 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.170
 pretty clear in the institutions you see 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.670
 in my videos that of that too 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.500
 He said a description of the video that does not 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.449
 explained more carefully ok 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.529
