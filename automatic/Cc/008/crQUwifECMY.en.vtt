00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.560
Hi everybody. My English is limited so

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.600
I'm just grateful to the Laureus Academy

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.239
for nominating me in
this category and

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.890
giving me this prize. I am thinking about
all of the

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.910
nominations. Amazing champions in this
category

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.239
and I want to thank all people who enabled me to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.000
arrive at this level and to arrive to win this prize.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.750
It's a real honour for me

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.750
and thank you for that.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.580
I have been

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.520
skiing very young. Everybody skied in my valley and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.950
I thought maybe from five years old

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.370
I think I know my body and I know me

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.560
and I can say in the morning if I can - if it's a good day for me

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.720
[and Marie Bochet

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.170
she really has started to dominate this standing category.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.470
You do a sport - you do it

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.480
because you like it. It's your inspiration. So I can actually say, "Wow

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.550
you can use, you carry on your success

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.870
to help other people to help

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.449
maybe the disabled children, and also maybe the

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.520
difficult case to live well with a disability

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.759
I say, maybe I can help them - and that's very cool

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.809
I think it's a good thing

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.300
Bochet goes into top spot!

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.620

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.379
