which<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.439> very<00:01:34.530> frustrating<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.670> i'm

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
which is very very frustrating so i'm

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.100 
which is very very frustrating so i'm
unsure<00:01:35.820> whether<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> play<00:01:36.570> him<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.810> commonly

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
unsure whether to play him so commonly

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.090 
unsure whether to play him so commonly
we've<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> minute<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:37.920> wing

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
we've got a minute the right wing
forward<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> highest<00:01:38.970> rated

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
forward which is the highest rated

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
forward which is the highest rated
position<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> best<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.979> team

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
position but not the best for team

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
position but not the best for team
spirit<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.729> hopefully<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> robin

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the start of division 4 and it could be

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.069

it could be a frustrating start two
divisions<00:02:34.530> because<00:02:34.709> usually<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.129> lose

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
divisions because usually when I lose

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
divisions because usually when I lose
