00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
which appears to come from what looks

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.660 
which appears to come from what looks
like<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> end<00:00:34.739> side<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> year<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
like the end side of the year but is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
like the end side of the year but is
going<00:00:35.910> outside<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> basically<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
going outside and basically what that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
going outside and basically what that
does<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.460> means<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.790> basically<00:00:42.590> your

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
does is a means that basically your

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
stretch take like the ears got into some

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
stretch take like the ears got into some
form<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.960> trauma<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.340> basically

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
form of trauma and that is basically

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119 
form of trauma and that is basically
pushing<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> end<00:00:48.390> say<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.770> know<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pushing the end say I know a lot of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
pushing the end say I know a lot of
cures<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> people<00:00:51.180> try<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cures for this that people try and do is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
cures for this that people try and do is
by<00:00:51.870> pushing<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> blower<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> side<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> ear

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
by pushing the blower and side the ear

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
by pushing the blower and side the ear
and<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.570> pushing<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> jewelry<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.739> through

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then pushing the jewelry and through

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
and then pushing the jewelry and through
the<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.530> way<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> way

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the back now that is just one way of way

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
the back now that is just one way of way
completely<00:00:59.820> screwing<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:01.170> everything<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
completely screwing up everything so I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
completely screwing up everything so I
would<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.609> recommend<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> didn't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
would really recommend that you didn't

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280 
would really recommend that you didn't
do<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.790> basically<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> best<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
do that and basically the best way to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.359 
do that and basically the best way to
prevent<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.580> quite<00:01:08.729> obvious<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:10.369> don't

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
prevent is it's quite obvious is don't

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
prevent is it's quite obvious is don't
stretch<00:01:11.700> quite<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.540> slow

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
stretch quite go slow

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.399 
stretch quite go slow
it's<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> race<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.869> basically<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.140> if

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's not a race and basically like if

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.179 
it's not a race and basically like if
when<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> stretch<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.270> blood<00:01:18.570> pus<00:01:19.200> or

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
when you stretch you see blood pus or

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
when you stretch you see blood pus or
anything<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.479> shouldn't<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.810> coming

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
anything that really shouldn't be coming

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
anything that really shouldn't be coming
I<00:01:22.200> say<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> aeo<00:01:22.939> you've<00:01:23.939> generally<00:01:24.540> done<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I say to aeo you've generally done it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.100 
I say to aeo you've generally done it
wrong<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.670> ear<00:01:26.909> shouldn't<00:01:27.270> bleed<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
wrong because an ear shouldn't bleed the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.999 
wrong because an ear shouldn't bleed the
more<00:01:28.320> salient<00:01:28.770> hump<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.750> I'm<00:01:30.750> cool<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
more salient hump and I'm cool with a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.160 
more salient hump and I'm cool with a
stretching<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.820> pop<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> shouldn't

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
stretching going pop but it shouldn't

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
stretching going pop but it shouldn't
sound<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> crunch<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.570> basically<00:01:36.840> like

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
sound like a crunch and I basically like

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
sound like a crunch and I basically like
as<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> say<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> best<00:01:38.070> way<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> avoid<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
as I say the best way to avoid this is I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
as I say the best way to avoid this is I
find<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> boys<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.900> notorious<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.470> tape<00:01:40.740> us

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
find the boys or notorious with tape us

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.270 
find the boys or notorious with tape us

with people that buy tapers it up to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
with people that buy tapers it up to
stop<00:01:44.280> quite<00:01:44.579> small<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.689> quite<00:01:45.899> back

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
stop quite small and then go quite back

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350

20<00:01:57.420> ml<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.930> 25<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.680> 25<00:01:59.280> Mills<00:01:59.520> over<00:01:59.759> say

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
20 ml to 25 which is 25 Mills over say

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.660 
20 ml to 25 which is 25 Mills over say
an<00:02:00.000> inch<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> basically<00:02:01.439> people<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.219> force

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
an inch and basically people just force

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.249 
an inch and basically people just force
the<00:02:02.880> taper<00:02:03.119> all<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.570> through<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the taper all the way through and I

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.440 
the taper all the way through and I
think<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> most<00:02:06.000> common

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
think that that's one of the most common

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.809 
think that that's one of the most common
sizes<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:07.049> head<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.350> blow<00:02:07.560> eyes<00:02:07.740> happening<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
sizes of head of blow eyes happening and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
sizes of head of blow eyes happening and
basically<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.690> best<00:02:09.810> thing<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.349> with

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
basically the best thing you do with

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.260 
basically the best thing you do with
that<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.700> just

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that is to just

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.150 
that is to just
for<00:02:13.480> one<00:02:13.660> trial<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.230> generally<00:02:14.560> used<00:02:14.740> tapers

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
for one trial and generally used tapers

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.200 
for one trial and generally used tapers
and<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.550> cheap<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.910> uh<00:02:15.940> no<00:02:16.060> they're

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
and all that cheap and uh no they're

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.080 
and all that cheap and uh no they're
easy<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.800> dead<00:02:17.800> stretching<00:02:18.340> or<00:02:18.490> taping<00:02:18.760> is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
easy but dead stretching or taping is

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.150 
easy but dead stretching or taping is

pores which can hold the bacteria

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.790 
pores which can hold the bacteria
which<00:04:26.180> can<00:04:26.360> then<00:04:26.480> in<00:04:26.660> turn<00:04:26.690> cause<00:04:27.139> infections

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
which can then in turn cause infections

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.950 
which can then in turn cause infections
even<00:04:28.639> when<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:28.910> think<00:04:29.120> your<00:04:29.270> ears<00:04:29.389> heal<00:04:29.720> they

can even cause infection stay in the
lane

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
lane

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.730 
lane
so<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.780> best<00:04:32.930> thing<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.350> perspective

so the best thing to the perspective

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.140 
so the best thing to the perspective
would<00:04:34.160> stick<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:34.970> steel<00:04:35.410> stick<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.530> glass

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.190 
twice a day until you think that the
car's<00:05:12.860> gone<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.610> basically<00:05:14.000> if<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.840> do<00:05:14.990> that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
car's gone and basically if you do that

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.780 
car's gone and basically if you do that
I<00:05:15.260> with<00:05:15.560> them<00:05:15.680> recommend<00:05:16.220> waiting<00:05:16.550> for<00:05:16.760> a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
I with them recommend waiting for a

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.250 
I with them recommend waiting for a
while<00:05:17.060> before<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.720> say<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.930> start

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
while before you to say to start

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.620 
while before you to say to start
stretching<00:05:18.530> again<00:05:18.770> because<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:20.330> last<00:05:20.510> thing

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
stretching again because the last thing

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.000 
stretching again because the last thing
you<00:05:20.810> want<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.050> do<00:05:21.200> is<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.410> bring<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.740> tear

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
you want to do is to bring that tear

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.770 
you want to do is to bring that tear
again<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.700> can<00:05:22.850> then<00:05:23.060> end<00:05:23.240> up<00:05:23.389> having<00:05:23.690> the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
again and you can then end up having the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.379 
again and you can then end up having the
problem<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.229> had<00:05:24.470> with<00:05:25.160> my<00:05:25.400> right<00:05:25.610> ear<00:05:25.639> which<00:05:26.210> is

problem I had with my right ear which is

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.390 
problem I had with my right ear which is
where<00:05:26.570> a<00:05:26.600> tear<00:05:26.930> can<00:05:27.080> eventually<00:05:27.380> turn<00:05:27.860> into<00:05:28.160> a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
where a tear can eventually turn into a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.279 
where a tear can eventually turn into a
