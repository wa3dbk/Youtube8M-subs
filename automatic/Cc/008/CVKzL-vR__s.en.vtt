 free but contrary to other occasions 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.870
 the cacique did not die and it was like that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.700
 how he found an impossible goal by felipe 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.829
 flowers in the first minute of discount 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 for overflowing hugs 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.300
 after the meeting the protagonists and the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.670
 dt hector tapia analyzed the victory 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.020
 I give you my guel they told us it's all 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.880
 psychological nobody can forget about 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.040
 to play 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.560
 in the big team 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.970
 generally scaled software those that 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.980
 they come in their players that always in 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.780
 his team stand out then nobody gets 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 can forget to play is a theme 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.439
 psychological 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.790
 know that you have to have confidence that 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.750
 you have to keep working with the team 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750
 and he showed very good things 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 I took a step forward, we do not have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.049
 the coal this we know what 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.790
 that next week biology and a 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.159
 team that long ago coming 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.470
 doing things well but we in 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.090
 the week we will try 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.370
 find the skill that they 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 they have to be a party of 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.600
 competition or happy happy because 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.340
 I believe that a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.050
 as I said a barrier but what to 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.520
 many more 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.170
 other young people like us those of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 down quarry can also be 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.430
 also because it was like complicated to the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.840
 start we dominate the first match 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.210
 time and the second one costs us a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.770
 little they matched us but thanks 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.530
 encourages a final that was very important 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.690
 win 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.220
 especially so it was the reason why 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.450
 It was the week 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.450
 I think we all feel the game the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 departure of liked along with marcelo 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.500
 us especially because we worked 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.329
 with them but but we still noticed a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.740
 total disposition of all of all the 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.470
 group 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.520
 and they worked very well during the week 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.780
 and that gave us gave us foot and gave us the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.620
 certainty that we were going to get a good 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 Fortunately, that's how it was 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.090
 if it is a very entertaining match very of 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.670
 going round and at the end exciting because 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.709
 he also won as he likes 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 our our people so fighting 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.440
 struggling with a very disputed goal 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 Sebastian had a pretty injury 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.519
 complicated and he had a job 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 planned so that if it were 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.390
 feeling with more confidence than reaching 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.390
 be in the best conditions for 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.270
 can play 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.270
 this was the same I do not say that with 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.640
 liked was going to play but sebastiÃ¡n is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.850
 arriving just at a time where he already 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.500
 is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.800
 today he proved it is in full 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.120
 conditions to be able to play until the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.030
 last week I was playing in the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.110
 second and what I needed was football 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.410
 overcome 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.250
 to everything that everything 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.740
 felipe vive you have to have a lot of 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 It's really interesting to fight that 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.900
 ball and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.299
 fighting until the end 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.579
 it was a test of everything that is 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.370
 fight in the week to be able to 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.470
 turn this situation and not only 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.390
 imagine that we were 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.490
 with a pressure with the whole issue and in the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.490
 banking when he made the goal was 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.220
 other than 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.840
 I believe that since we were born here in this 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.090
 club 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.670
 like we like 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.010
 suddenly you win, you gain 340 in a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.930
 good chassis and you're happy but when 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.040
 you win well fighting with a rival that 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.510
 gets and at the end a play totally 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.569
 disputed and with being option to be 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 so that the goal is enjoyed by him 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.319
 enjoy the next challenge much more 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.879
 it will be before o'higgins in santa laura the 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.879
 Saturday at 3:30 p.m.
