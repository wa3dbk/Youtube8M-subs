00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.569
 Hello and welcome to another video from IQ at 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.319
 Today I have a docking point Inc and a video for you and I did that 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.820
 get a percent from the company Raptors 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 and now we'll just unpack that together 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 that's so 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.130
 as the first topic comes to mind the bill is against several 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.979
 pages 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.159
 and then we have the products 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.540
 HTC Sense the product 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.720
 and that's about this in a row the letters is this is a woman it 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.129
 went ahead you drove forward 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.790
 and for everyone 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.480
 and also for the side parts exactly 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 then we still have the percent 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.260
 Glue instructions 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.380
 and we still have a small cleaning cloth 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.830
 I put that was all side and we take a look at the percent 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.830
 it was outside the walls 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.399
 percent 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.399
 our focus on it is so 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.400
 Namely, this gene is called before their bed way so by Batman 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.960
 with the course also in the batman logo 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 good «This is for the back 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.160
 "That's another one with the Logo Cup that means Euler Apple's iPhone 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.130
 therefore be visible even if the percent 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.200
 Skinner offered you can still see that around an apple 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 and that is the front and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 also the side parts 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.270
 that lowers in the car without something on the goat 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.880
 and now I will also install my iPhone and I'll get you that soon 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.770
 quirky or bring 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 see you soon 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.290
 so welcome back 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 In the meantime, I have now attached the foil 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.480
 so quote 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.160
 I hope you can so I know the slide is already relative in itself 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.790
 dark 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.380
 but I think it looks pretty good 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.770
 so and these on the wall 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 the box 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 Lohmar is not quite that creeping 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.489
 yes but otherwise I have the film I think times quite appropriate 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.090
 above all, of course, TuS is hundred percent in my opinion 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.719
 and also the front where I last had extreme problems with because of 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.139
 I actually managed to get along these narrow bridges this time 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:37.019
 and yes so the film I like very well also the design of the attachment 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.509
 Heidi Spitz was pretty easy 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.039
 and Dr 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.139
 that's how it looks 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.889
 Of course, here is also a recess percent here 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.039
 for Dehen light sensor so for the r and sensor 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.999
 and in the year otherwise the foil is very fits exactly and must be so one 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.969
 be careful when attaching grade to such thin places 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.040
 politics, of course, a bit on the fingers and the air just 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.609
 Do not pull too hard on it because of course, the film so naturally 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.169
 a little bit of the end 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.010
 until you have full control 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.610
 Well, if we click on it then the bars will be too long 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.329
 you have to have and take care a bit but I think so 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.200
 It was relatively easy to install and it feels pretty good now 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.899
 Another positive effect is of course that you look through the slide here 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.039
 in the 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.809
 the death grip percent is diminished so a bit so my 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.759
 Opinion that he is not quite the way may also be due to who Commichau 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.439
 despite clock in Bonn the frame 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.959
 but diminished at the white paper 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.799
 So it's not that extreme anymore 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.499
 because we do that even if it is such a handle now 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.499
 because I still receive my three to four bars reception 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.349
 Well 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.030
 this was my video for rap after the percent slide 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.479
 that from the previous year 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.739
 and the spö thanks not so warmly at the company weather of the left sense of the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.219
 of course you have already seen the description of the logo Weier 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.329
 displayed 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.209
 that's it 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.189
 and the work of the video has made comments rated the video and 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.019
 subscribe me until next time clearly
