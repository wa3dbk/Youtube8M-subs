that<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:33.019> my<00:03:34.019> view<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:35.220> game<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that so my view of this game is

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.729 
that so my view of this game is
definitely<00:03:36.510> less<00:03:36.810> scary<00:03:37.230> than<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.620> other

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
definitely less scary than the other

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.979 
definitely less scary than the other
ones<00:03:38.010> that's<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.670> sure<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:40.310> got<00:03:41.310> my<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:42.540> got

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
ones that's for sure and I got my I got

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.080 
ones that's for sure and I got my I got
the<00:03:43.049> custom<00:03:44.010> thumbnail<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.549> third<00:03:44.879> one

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the custom thumbnail of the third one

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.589 
the custom thumbnail of the third one
that's<00:03:45.269> my<00:03:46.730> background<00:03:47.730> image<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.420> think

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
that's my background image and I think

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.680 
that's my background image and I think
anyway<00:03:49.459> that's<00:03:50.459> pretty<00:03:50.760> much<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.329> luma<00:03:51.510> games

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
anyway that's pretty much for luma games

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.660 
anyway that's pretty much for luma games
number<00:03:51.930> four<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:52.590> creepy<00:03:52.920> at<00:03:53.129> all<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.609> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
number four that's creepy at all but I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.640 
number four that's creepy at all but I
mean<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.150> end<00:03:54.269> was<00:03:54.359> kind<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.810> scary<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.410> not

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
mean the end was kind of scary but not

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.979 
mean the end was kind of scary but not
that<00:03:55.799> much<00:03:56.010> because<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:57.000> didn't<00:03:57.660> have<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
that much because I didn't have the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.020 
that much because I didn't have the
headphones<00:03:58.410> me<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.549> something<00:03:59.879> with

headphones me that to do something with
that<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.810> other<00:04:01.079> than<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:02.690> wish<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.959> could

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
that but other than that I wish I could

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.699 
that but other than that I wish I could
