if anybody even saw it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.090 
if anybody even saw it
they<00:00:41.850> probably<00:00:42.300> rented<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> VHS<00:00:43.829> tape

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and it had this title and also the alien

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
and it had this title and also the alien
says<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> continually<00:00:48.750> throughout<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
says it continually throughout the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
says it continually throughout the
entire<00:00:49.590> movie<00:00:52.219> Dolph<00:00:53.219> Lundgren<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.699> great
