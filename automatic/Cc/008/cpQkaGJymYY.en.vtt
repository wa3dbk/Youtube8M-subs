different weather conditions and over
this<00:01:57.460> radar<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.060> have<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.479> floor<00:01:58.930> camera

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
this radar you have the floor camera

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.740 
this radar you have the floor camera
it's<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.800> forward-looking<00:02:00.190> infrared<00:02:00.970> which

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
it's a forward-looking infrared which

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's a forward-looking infrared which
uses<00:02:02.110> thermal<00:02:02.410> imaging<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.250> gives<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
uses thermal imaging and gives the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.580 
uses thermal imaging and gives the
images<00:02:03.940> directly<00:02:04.420> inside<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.990> helmets<00:02:05.380> of

inside<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.410> area<00:02:50.620> basic<00:02:51.370> quality<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
inside this area basic quality of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.720 
inside this area basic quality of the
cockpit<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.019> glass<00:02:53.799> cockpit<00:02:54.069> concept

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
cockpit is it's a glass cockpit concept

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.100 
cockpit is it's a glass cockpit concept
so<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.600> see<00:02:55.810> five<00:02:56.910> MFT<00:02:57.940> displays<00:02:58.510> here<00:02:58.870> on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
so you can see five MFT displays here on

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.350 
so you can see five MFT displays here on
which<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.470> can<00:02:59.650> put<00:03:00.250> anything<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.910> want<00:03:01.150> from

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
which you can put anything you want from

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.870 
which you can put anything you want from
the<00:03:01.450> camera<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.739> instruments<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
engine power anything can really

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.059 
engine power anything can really
displays<00:03:06.400> monies<00:03:06.790> on<00:03:07.540> these<00:03:07.780> screens<00:03:08.069> after

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
displays monies on these screens after

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.130 
displays monies on these screens after
that<00:03:09.250> under<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.510> computer

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
that under here you have the computer

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.170 
that under here you have the computer
system<00:03:11.500> which<00:03:11.769> allows<00:03:12.069> us<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.310> control

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
system which allows us to control

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.589 
system which allows us to control
navigation<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.819> payload<00:03:15.819> weight<00:03:16.180> are<00:03:16.540> we

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
navigation and payload weight are we

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.990 
navigation and payload weight are we
going<00:03:16.870> into<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.260> flight<00:03:17.560> controls<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
going into the flight controls and the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.809 
going into the flight controls and the
last<00:03:19.450> thing<00:03:19.690> here<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.410> automatic<00:03:21.250> flight

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
last thing here is the automatic flight

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.210 
last thing here is the automatic flight
control<00:03:21.880> system<00:03:22.599> which<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.739> relatively

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
control system which is relatively

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.140 
control system which is relatively
performant<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.030> which<00:03:25.540> allows<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.079> pilot<00:03:26.290> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
performant and which allows the pilot to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.630 
performant and which allows the pilot to
let<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.359> helicopter<00:03:28.840> fly<00:03:29.049> by<00:03:29.290> itself<00:03:29.650> okay<00:03:30.549> as

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
let the helicopter fly by itself okay as

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.880 
let the helicopter fly by itself okay as
