let's play a little bit so you can hear

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:29.080 
let's play a little bit so you can hear
the<00:00:14.990> system

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.880 

so<00:00:29.660> I'm<00:00:29.930> actually<00:00:30.199> playing<00:00:30.590> with<00:00:30.710> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
so I'm actually playing with the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.560 
so I'm actually playing with the
wireless<00:00:31.279> system<00:00:31.609> hooked<00:00:31.699> up<00:00:31.910> right<00:00:32.119> now

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
wireless system hooked up right now

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.360 
wireless system hooked up right now
I<00:00:32.599> have<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.260> belt<00:00:33.410> pack<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:33.950> right<00:00:34.160> on<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
I have the belt pack on right on the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.220 
I have the belt pack on right on the
side<00:00:34.610> here<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.090> then<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.600> can<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:35.989> the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
side here and then you can see that the

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.439 
side here and then you can see that the
receiver<00:00:36.620> is<00:00:36.890> right<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.670> on<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.059> pedal

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
receiver is right in the on the pedal

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.660 
receiver is right in the on the pedal
board<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.930> for<00:00:39.680> guitar<00:00:40.040> players<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:40.610> is

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
board and for guitar players this is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.970 
board and for guitar players this is
ideal<00:00:41.150> because<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.629> can<00:00:41.930> reside<00:00:42.500> on<00:00:42.530> your

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
ideal because it can reside on your

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.250 
ideal because it can reside on your
pedal<00:00:43.430> board<00:00:43.670> or<00:00:44.239> on<00:00:44.390> your<00:00:44.480> amplifier<00:00:44.989> if

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
pedal board or on your amplifier if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.040 
pedal board or on your amplifier if
you're<00:00:45.440> not<00:00:45.949> using<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.699> elaborate<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:47.750> pedal

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
you're not using as elaborate of a pedal

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.439 
you're not using as elaborate of a pedal
system<00:00:48.410> as<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.739> is<00:00:48.980> right<00:00:49.220> here<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:50.089> on<00:00:50.269> the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
system as this is right here but on the

that<00:01:19.659> another<00:01:20.659> feature<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.380> aside<00:01:21.710> from

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that another feature on this aside from

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.620 
that another feature on this aside from
the<00:01:22.070> output<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:22.850> would<00:01:23.150> go<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.420> your

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
the output that would go to your

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870 
the output that would go to your
amplifier<00:01:23.780> or<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.530> your<00:01:24.680> pedals<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.790> we

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
amplifier or to your pedals is that we

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.789 
amplifier or to your pedals is that we
have<00:01:26.030> another<00:01:26.240> redundant<00:01:26.869> output<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:27.740> is

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
have another redundant output that is

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.679 
have another redundant output that is
constantly<00:01:28.549> live<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.210> would<00:01:29.360> go<00:01:29.509> into

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
constantly live and that would go into

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.660 
constantly live and that would go into
your<00:01:29.930> tuner<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.470> here<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:30.890> if<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.220> mute<00:01:31.520> it

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
your tuner right here so if you mute it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.819 
your tuner right here so if you mute it
if<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.909> went<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.390> back<00:01:32.570> side<00:01:32.900> here<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.679> I

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
if I went to the back side here and I

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.340 
if I went to the back side here and I
actually<00:01:34.280> mute<00:01:34.520> at<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.240> transmitter<00:01:36.079> I

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
actually mute at the the transmitter I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.380 
actually mute at the the transmitter I
can<00:01:36.979> be<00:01:37.100> tuning<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.520> can<00:01:37.670> see<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.179> tuner

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
can be tuning you can see that the tuner

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.569 
can be tuning you can see that the tuner
is<00:01:38.509> active<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:39.829> actually<00:01:40.189> been<00:01:40.310> active

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
is active it's actually been active

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.919 
is active it's actually been active
during<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.850> whole<00:01:41.060> time<00:01:41.270> I'm<00:01:41.420> playing<00:01:41.659> but

during the whole time I'm playing but

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.749 
during the whole time I'm playing but
you<00:01:42.079> can<00:01:42.229> see<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.859> mute<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.310> system

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
you can see that I can mute the system

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.899 
you can see that I can mute the system
and<00:01:43.999> still<00:01:44.659> have<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.289> tuner<00:01:45.890> active<00:01:46.249> now

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
and still have the tuner active now

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.940 
and still have the tuner active now

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
dry signal go to the console either for

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.279 
dry signal go to the console either for
processing<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.240> guitar<00:01:56.569> signal<00:01:57.049> through

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
processing the guitar signal through

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.889 
processing the guitar signal through
other<00:01:57.469> methods<00:01:58.219> or<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:59.119> being<00:01:59.659> able<00:01:59.749> to

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
other methods or just being able to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.859 
other methods or just being able to
record<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.530> signal<00:02:00.979> dragged<00:02:01.609> directly<00:02:02.600> for

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
record the signal dragged directly for

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.069 
record the signal dragged directly for
future<00:02:03.679> usage<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:04.490> there's<00:02:05.210> quite<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.630> bit<00:02:05.929> of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
future usage so there's quite a bit of

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.870 
future usage so there's quite a bit of
features<00:02:06.439> on<00:02:06.679> this<00:02:07.009> system<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.850> can

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
features on this system here as you can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.320 
features on this system here as you can
see<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.660> body<00:02:08.899> Peck<00:02:09.200> by<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> way<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:11.270> a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
see the body Peck by the way is a is a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.040 
see the body Peck by the way is a is a
metal<00:02:11.930> body<00:02:12.170> pack<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.790> allows<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.690> just

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
metal body pack it allows you to just

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.830 
metal body pack it allows you to just
have<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.950> regular<00:02:16.280> very<00:02:16.970> rugged<00:02:17.240> system

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
have a just a regular very rugged system

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.570 
have a just a regular very rugged system
here<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.740> guitar<00:02:19.100> players<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.490> be

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
here and you know guitar players can be

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.370 
here and you know guitar players can be
pretty<00:02:19.790> ruthless<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.390> their<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:21.200> their

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
pretty ruthless with their with their

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.800 
pretty ruthless with their with their
rig<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.490> metal<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.360> metal<00:02:23.660> body

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
rig but it's a metal it's a metal body

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.590 
rig but it's a metal it's a metal body
pack<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.410> uses<00:02:24.680> two<00:02:25.040> doublea's<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.510> be

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
pack it uses two doublea's so it can be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.340 
pack it uses two doublea's so it can be
power<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.080> quite<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> long<00:02:27.740> time<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.250> anyways

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
power for quite a long time so anyways

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.660 
power for quite a long time so anyways
let's<00:02:30.350> see<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> couple<00:02:30.680> other<00:02:30.950> features<00:02:31.190> here

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
let's see a couple other features here

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.830 
let's see a couple other features here
as<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.240> listen<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.630> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
as you listen to this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.620 
as you listen to this
we<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.800> feature<00:02:35.250> called<00:02:35.670> cable<00:02:36.300> tone

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
we have this feature called cable tone

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.990 
we have this feature called cable tone
and<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.530> cable<00:02:37.890> tone<00:02:38.099> does<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.580> as<00:02:38.730> ads

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and what cable tone does is as ads

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.770 
and what cable tone does is as ads
actually<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.459> kind<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.360> feature<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
actually the kind of the the feature of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
actually the kind of the the feature of
how<00:02:43.319> much<00:02:43.500> cable<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.069> would<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.340> cable

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
how much cable you would have cable

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.150 
how much cable you would have cable
resistant<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.630> change<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.500> tone<00:02:46.860> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
resistant to kind of change the tone a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.559 
resistant to kind of change the tone a
lot<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.610> guys<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.910> into<00:02:48.120> lots<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.510> different

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
lot of guys are into lots of different

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.600 
lot of guys are into lots of different
types<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.200> guitar<00:02:49.500> cables<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.220> cable

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
types of guitar cables and with cable

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
types of guitar cables and with cable
tone<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.000> replicate<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.989> tone<00:02:52.260> of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
tone you can replicate the tone of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.130 
tone you can replicate the tone of
either<00:02:53.099> different<00:02:53.819> cables<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.569> different

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
either different cables or different

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.229 
either different cables or different
lengths<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> cables<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.489> I'm<00:02:56.640> gonna<00:02:56.790> play<00:02:57.030> this

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
lengths of cables so I'm gonna play this

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.630 
lengths of cables so I'm gonna play this
first<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.560> heard<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:59.040> before<00:02:59.489> this

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
first you as you heard this before this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.540 
first you as you heard this before this
is<00:02:59.819> without<00:02:59.970> any<00:03:00.180> effect

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.560 

now<00:03:05.550> we're<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.820> change<00:03:06.150> we're<00:03:06.390> going<00:03:06.480> to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
now we're going to change we're going to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.740 
now we're going to change we're going to
go<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.990> 3-meter<00:03:07.530> setting

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.570 

and<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> next<00:03:14.319> one<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.709> eight<00:03:15.220> years

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.520 

now<00:03:20.540> we're<00:03:20.750> going<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.990> 12<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.410> can

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
now we're going to 12 now as you can

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.620 
now we're going to 12 now as you can
hear<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:27.980> very<00:03:28.190> subtle<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.120> changing

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
hear it's very subtle but it is changing

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.190 
hear it's very subtle but it is changing
in<00:03:29.750> its<00:03:29.810> tone<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.280> 15<00:03:31.730> meters<00:03:32.200> we're

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
in its tone this is the 15 meters we're

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.540 
in its tone this is the 15 meters we're
at<00:03:33.290> 25<00:03:33.800> meters<00:03:34.190> actually<00:03:34.340> right<00:03:34.640> here

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.880 

back<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.090> zero<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> we're<00:03:45.080> back<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.440> zero<00:03:45.620> so

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
back to zero so we're back to zero so

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.860 
back to zero so we're back to zero so
there's<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.130> very<00:03:46.730> subtle<00:03:47.060> changes<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
there's a very subtle changes in the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.900 
there's a very subtle changes in the
tone<00:03:48.080> but<00:03:48.740> it's<00:03:48.890> definitely<00:03:49.040> very<00:03:49.400> effective

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
tone but it's definitely very effective

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.460 
tone but it's definitely very effective
where<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.120> would<00:03:50.390> use<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:50.990> if<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.260> had<00:03:51.440> a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
where I would use this as if I had a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.870 
where I would use this as if I had a
different<00:03:51.890> guitar<00:03:52.190> maybe<00:03:52.400> one<00:03:52.640> that's<00:03:52.820> a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
different guitar maybe one that's a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.160 
different guitar maybe one that's a
little<00:03:53.120> brighter<00:03:53.390> than<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.810> other<00:03:53.840> one<00:03:54.140> I

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
little brighter than the other one I

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.020 
little brighter than the other one I
could<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.620> could<00:03:55.100> actually<00:03:55.250> warm<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.730> up<00:03:55.850> by

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
could I could actually warm it up by

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.700 
could I could actually warm it up by
adding<00:03:56.240> some<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:56.720> cable<00:03:56.960> tone<00:03:57.290> into<00:03:57.590> it

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
adding some of that cable tone into it

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.770 
adding some of that cable tone into it
maybe<00:03:58.190> you're<00:03:58.370> using<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.790> distortion<00:03:59.240> setting

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
maybe you're using a distortion setting

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.660 
maybe you're using a distortion setting
that<00:03:59.900> needs<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.140> be<00:04:00.200> warmed<00:04:00.560> up<00:04:00.740> maybe<00:04:01.400> you

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
that needs to be warmed up maybe you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.610
