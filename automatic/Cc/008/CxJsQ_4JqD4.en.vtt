really
in<00:01:56.520> question<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.020> concept<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
in question it's in concept because you

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.400 
in question it's in concept because you
know<00:01:59.670> mr.<00:01:59.940> Conti<00:02:00.270> you've<00:02:00.630> talked<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.050> him<00:02:01.200> in

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
know mr. Conti you've talked to him in

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.620 
know mr. Conti you've talked to him in
and<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.950> seems<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.460> he's<00:02:02.640> he's<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> very

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and it seems to me like he's he's a very

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
and it seems to me like he's he's a very
straightforward<00:02:04.080> guy<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.040> he<00:02:05.400> knows<00:02:05.580> there

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
straightforward guy but he knows there

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.460 
straightforward guy but he knows there
is<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.150> process<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.080> have<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.350> go

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
is this process that you have to go

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.590 
is this process that you have to go
through<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> process<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
through there is a process that will is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.650 
through there is a process that will is
gonna<00:02:09.900> control<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.330> league<00:02:12.540> has

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
gonna control that and the league has

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.090 
gonna control that and the league has
made<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.900> very<00:02:12.930> clear<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:13.770> control

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
made it very clear that it will control

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.920 
made it very clear that it will control
the<00:02:14.250> process<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.030> there's<00:02:15.480> also<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.750> very

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the process and there's also a very

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.320 
the process and there's also a very
specific<00:02:16.260> window<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> team<00:02:17.850> has<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
specific window that a team has to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.610 
specific window that a team has to
announce<00:02:18.600> because<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> league<00:02:19.350> does<00:02:19.590> not

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
announce because the league does not

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.420 
announce because the league does not
want<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.540> lame-duck<00:02:21.540> team<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.920> can't<00:02:23.220> sell

until about January mid-january to late

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920 
until about January mid-january to late
February<00:02:31.770> Indo<00:02:32.460> when<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> team<00:02:33.420> were<00:02:33.570> announced

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
February Indo when a team were announced

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.970 
February Indo when a team were announced
and<00:02:34.400> my<00:02:35.400> guess<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.860> an

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and my guess is that it's the it's an

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.550 
and my guess is that it's the it's an
educated<00:02:38.400> guess<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.140> Rams<00:02:40.380> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
educated guess then it's the Rams that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.550 
educated guess then it's the Rams that
are<00:02:40.740> like<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.040> first<00:02:41.310> move<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:42.120> you've<00:02:42.270> also

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
are like that first move but you've also

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.020 
are like that first move but you've also
indicated<00:02:43.560> we've<00:02:43.770> been<00:02:43.950> talking<00:02:44.310> about<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
indicated we've been talking about the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.460 
indicated we've been talking about the
Raiders<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.540> said<00:02:45.750> they<00:02:45.960> would<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.260> willing

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
Raiders have said they would be willing

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.890 
Raiders have said they would be willing
to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.370> second<00:02:47.790> team<00:02:47.940> into<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> stadium<00:02:48.690> if
