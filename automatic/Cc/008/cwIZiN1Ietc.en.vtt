00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.130 

all<00:00:02.909> right<00:00:03.149> so<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.360> think<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.720> figured<00:00:03.959> out

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
all right so I think I figured out

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.369 
all right so I think I figured out
what's<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.009> door<00:00:05.250> handle<00:00:06.379> it

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
what's going on with this door handle it

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.310 
what's going on with this door handle it
got<00:00:07.649> broken<00:00:07.980> off<00:00:09.290> by<00:00:10.290> somebody<00:00:11.840> who<00:00:12.840> probably

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
got broken off by somebody who probably

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.839 
got broken off by somebody who probably
ain't<00:00:13.500> got<00:00:13.710> too<00:00:13.950> hard<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.309> something<00:00:14.429> so

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
ain't got too hard or something so

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.029 
ain't got too hard or something so
what's<00:00:15.330> happening<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.440> can't<00:00:16.740> lock

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
what's happening here is I can't lock

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.090 
what's happening here is I can't lock
the<00:00:17.400> door<00:00:17.660> with<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> handle<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the door with the handle out like this

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.490 
the door with the handle out like this
is<00:00:20.220> loose<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> put<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> handle<00:00:22.230> toward

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
is loose so I put the handle toward

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.029 
is loose so I put the handle toward
supposed<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.789> unlock<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> door<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
supposed to go I can unlock the door and

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
supposed to go I can unlock the door and
the<00:00:26.039> reason<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.670> not<00:00:26.760> sitting<00:00:27.269> flush<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the reason it's not sitting flush is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.859 
the reason it's not sitting flush is
because<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.560> spring<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
because it's a little spring in here and

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
because it's a little spring in here and
it<00:00:30.869> rests<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.560> piece<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.219> got<00:00:32.309> broken

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it rests on this piece that got broken

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.330 
it rests on this piece that got broken
off<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> won't<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.829> won't<00:00:34.980> lock

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
off and so it won't it won't lock

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
off and so it won't it won't lock
because<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.180> can't<00:00:36.480> give<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> door<00:00:37.860> handle

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
because I can't give the door handle

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.440 
because I can't give the door handle
isn't<00:00:38.430> flush<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> new<00:00:40.110> one

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
isn't flush you can see on this new one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.729 
isn't flush you can see on this new one
you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.530> sits

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you can see on a new one that it sits

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.990 
you can see on a new one that it sits
flush<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.250> by<00:00:44.430> itself

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
flush all by itself

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
flush all by itself
so<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> let<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.610> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
so let's when you let go of it you can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.760 
so let's when you let go of it you can
just<00:00:48.059> lock<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
just lock it and it's because this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
just lock it and it's because this
little<00:00:50.070> piece<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.280> broken<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
little piece is broken here and the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.580 
little piece is broken here and the
spring<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.590> gone<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
spring is gone so and there is just the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
spring is gone so and there is just the
one<00:00:55.620> cable<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> control

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one cable right here is the control

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
one cable right here is the control
cable<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.920> runs<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.090> see

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
cable that runs back and you can see

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170 
cable that runs back and you can see
that<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.070> can<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.250> hopefully<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> see

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that I can see hopefully you can see

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.810 
that I can see hopefully you can see
that<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> runs<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.170> lock<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.129> one

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that that runs the lock like this one

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.990 
that that runs the lock like this one
locks<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.840> pulls<00:01:07.140> further<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:08.670> unlatch

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
locks off it pulls further to unlatch

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
locks off it pulls further to unlatch
the<00:01:09.210> door<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> does<00:01:10.110> both<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.780> there's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the door so it does both and there's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.310 
the door so it does both and there's
only<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.710> bolt<00:01:14.010> holding<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.460> thing<00:01:14.520> on

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
only one bolt holding this thing on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:28.249 
only one bolt holding this thing on
which<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.830> here

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.679 

no<00:01:29.259> no<00:01:29.530> if<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:29.770> can<00:01:29.950> see<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.430> but<00:01:30.729> all<00:01:31.390> that's

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
no no if you can see that but all that's

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.420 
no no if you can see that but all that's
here<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.619> little<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:35.409> cable<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.280> so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
here is this one little one cable and so

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.770 
here is this one little one cable and so
I'm<00:01:36.490> going<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.670> try<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.909> get<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.270> off<00:01:37.509> that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I'm going to try to get that off that

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.669 
I'm going to try to get that off that
might<00:01:37.929> be<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> little<00:01:38.350> bit<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.649> pain<00:01:39.929> but<00:01:40.929> also

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
might be a little bit of a pain but also

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.370 
might be a little bit of a pain but also
I<00:01:41.920> wanted<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.220> show<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:43.659> happens<00:01:44.140> when<00:01:44.200> you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
I wanted to show what happens when you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.130 
I wanted to show what happens when you
try<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.619> use<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.920> automatic<00:01:45.490> door<00:01:45.729> locks<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
try to use the automatic door locks and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.130 
try to use the automatic door locks and
you<00:01:47.289> just<00:01:47.530> put<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:49.380> back<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.590> temporarily

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
you just put that back on temporarily

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.880 
you just put that back on temporarily
hit<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.289> key<00:01:54.539> you'll<00:01:55.539> see<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:56.349> won't<00:01:56.560> lock<00:02:01.890> see

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
hit the key you'll see it won't lock see

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.669 
hit the key you'll see it won't lock see
it<00:02:03.009> tries<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:04.119> couple<00:02:04.689> times<00:02:04.959> but<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.500> won't

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
it tries to a couple times but it won't

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.740 
it tries to a couple times but it won't
do<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.009> because<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.909> dark<00:02:07.119> needled<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.569> hold

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
do it because the dark needled if I hold

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.080 
do it because the dark needled if I hold
it<00:02:07.929> close<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.170> bet<00:02:08.530> it'll<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.009> see<00:02:09.819> there<00:02:10.000> are

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
it close I bet it'll do it see there are

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.820 
it close I bet it'll do it see there are
locks<00:02:10.299> just<00:02:10.599> fine<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:12.370> unlocks<00:02:12.760> fine<00:02:13.120> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
locks just fine and unlocks fine so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.069 
locks just fine and unlocks fine so
anyway<00:02:15.090> change<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> out<00:02:16.390> we'll<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.810> how<00:02:16.959> it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
anyway change it out we'll see how it

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.140 
anyway change it out we'll see how it
goes
