 It's a character from sr, but frankly it's not a character from l 3. 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.820

 I have a few characters from the gun slightly 1b 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.619
 It looks like you put a real character on it , 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.640
 It's just a character. 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.750
 Just a character is a regular character. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.640

 Anyway, I heard three cards like this. The quality of Kazuz is great. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.390
 Well, Collie said the quality is real and soft.

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:27.790
 Who is the main character? 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:30.459
