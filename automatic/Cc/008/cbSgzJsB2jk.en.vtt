00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
this card can really save you especially
in<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> slower<00:01:24.540> version<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.990> dark<00:01:25.200> rules<00:01:25.380> they

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in the slower version of dark rules they

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
in the slower version of dark rules they
can<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.280> nice<00:01:26.460> um<00:01:26.790> whether

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
can really really be nice um whether

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
can really really be nice um whether
using<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> defensively<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.619> aggressively<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
using it defensively or aggressively to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.539 
using it defensively or aggressively to
push<00:01:29.790> harder<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.829> dualities<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
push harder and the dualities for the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
push harder and the dualities for the
consistency<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.240> nice<00:01:33.420> too<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and go off from there the one Eradicator

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.380 
and go off from there the one Eradicator
obviously<00:02:44.130> because<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.760> only<00:02:44.880> play<00:02:45.150> one

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
obviously because I can only play one

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.840 
obviously because I can only play one
and<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.230> absence<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.650> light<00:02:46.800> another<00:02:47.760> one

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
and so can absence of light another one

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.090 
and so can absence of light another one
