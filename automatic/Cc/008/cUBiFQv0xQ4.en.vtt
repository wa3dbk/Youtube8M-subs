00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
we don't know yet and this is a fairy
like<00:01:44.759> I've<00:01:44.970> said<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.320> played<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
like I've said actually not played the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
like I've said actually not played the
game<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:47.070> saying<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.299> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
game was saying you know that this is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
game was saying you know that this is
Max's<00:01:49.049> dick<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.040> Maxis<00:01:50.460> it's

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
Max's dick this could be Maxis it's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
Max's dick this could be Maxis it's
possible<00:01:51.149> we've<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> same<00:01:52.259> facial

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
possible we've got the same facial

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
possible we've got the same facial
features<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.549> I've<00:01:53.790> walked<00:01:54.060> closely<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
features which I've walked closely at it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.370 
features which I've walked closely at it
and<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.799> does<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.329> sort<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and it does it it has that sort of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.429 
and it does it it has that sort of
features<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> nose<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> nose

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
features with the nose as well the nose

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.490 
features with the nose as well the nose
sort<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.009> looks<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> same<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.880> Max's<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
sort of looks the same to Max's but I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.200 
sort of looks the same to Max's but I
don't<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> beard<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.969> he

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
don't know with all that beard and go he

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.960 
don't know with all that beard and go he
he<00:02:06.420> doesn't<00:02:06.659> sell<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.459> I'm

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
he doesn't sell it for me so I'm

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.900 
he doesn't sell it for me so I'm
knocking<00:02:09.599> max<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.430> as

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
knocking max it's out of the way but as

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820 
knocking max it's out of the way but as
you<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.300> though<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can see though you can see the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
you can see though you can see the
is<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.130> gray<00:02:14.490> her<00:02:14.790> which<00:02:15.120> Maxis<00:02:15.780> obviously<00:02:16.140> will

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
is I gray her which Maxis obviously will

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
is I gray her which Maxis obviously will
have<00:02:16.290> because<00:02:16.830> he's<00:02:16.970> he's<00:02:17.970> getting<00:02:18.330> on<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
have because he's he's getting on a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.540 
have because he's he's getting on a
little<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.170> I'm<00:02:19.290> knocking<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
little bit but I'm knocking the the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.420 
little bit but I'm knocking the the
theory<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.970> Max<00:02:21.930> maybe<00:02:22.710> max<00:02:23.010> has<00:02:23.160> helped<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
theory of Max maybe max has helped the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.350 
theory of Max maybe max has helped the
window<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.360> tested<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.200> half

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
window and just tested it on a half

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.210 
window and just tested it on a half
mutated<00:02:27.360> person<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:27.960> we<00:02:28.050> take<00:02:28.200> Azam<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.010> man

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
mutated person so we take Azam I can man

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
mutated person so we take Azam I can man
that<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.850> turning<00:02:30.210> into<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.690> zombie<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that was turning into a zombie and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.540 
that was turning into a zombie and
Richthofen<00:02:31.770> wants<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.460> is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
Richthofen wants to see what is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.460 
Richthofen wants to see what is
happening<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.150> his<00:02:33.270> brain<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.780> make<00:02:33.990> him<00:02:34.230> turn

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
happening to his brain to make him turn

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.090 
happening to his brain to make him turn
to<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.740> zombie<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.990> see<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.830> yeah

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
to a zombie but we see that and yeah

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.950 
to a zombie but we see that and yeah
that's<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.490> found<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.300> know<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.750> just

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
that's all found and you know it's just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.300 
that's all found and you know it's just
normal<00:02:40.320> ripped<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.920> being<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.130> crazy

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
normal ripped off and being a crazy

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.150 
normal ripped off and being a crazy
scientist<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.440> moves<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
scientist but then it's it moves on to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.720 
scientist but then it's it moves on to
the<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.960> one<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:46.770> he's<00:02:47.340> looking<00:02:47.460> at

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the the the one where he's looking at

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850
