00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
how I did a couple of the mixes up for

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.350 
how I did a couple of the mixes up for
Al<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> preset<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.610> flaps<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> go<00:00:42.180> down

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
Al and preset for the flaps to go down

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.830 
Al and preset for the flaps to go down
and<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> thermal<00:00:43.950> load<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
and you can do a thermal load too and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.310 
and you can do a thermal load too and
you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.610> launch<00:00:47.610> preset<00:00:48.090> too<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.480> well

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you can do a launch preset too as well

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
you can do a launch preset too as well
as<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> cruise<00:00:49.770> mode<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.700> your

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
as a cruise mode so that's really your

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.100 
as a cruise mode so that's really your
four<00:00:51.149> main<00:00:52.340> flight<00:00:53.340> modes<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.110> in

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
four main flight modes that you need in

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.369 
four main flight modes that you need in
my<00:00:55.320> opinion<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> people<00:00:58.140> say

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
my opinion I know a lot of people say

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
my opinion I know a lot of people say
that<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> need<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> better<00:00:59.160> transmitter<00:00:59.730> like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that you need a better transmitter like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
that you need a better transmitter like
the<00:01:00.059> futaba<00:01:00.480> 8fg<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.140> yes<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> futaba<00:01:01.829> 8fg<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the futaba 8fg and yes the futaba 8fg is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
the futaba 8fg and yes the futaba 8fg is
a<00:01:02.430> lot<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.760> user-friendly<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.660> you're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
for the launch preset we're going to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
for the launch preset we're going to
need<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.970> you

need to do I'm going to need to go you
come<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.259> main<00:01:16.380> screen<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
come from your main screen this is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
come from your main screen this is
binary<00:01:17.880> 900<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:18.990> actually<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
binary 900 you don't actually have a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
binary 900 you don't actually have a
glider<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> regular<00:01:20.759> plane<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
glider it's just a regular plane it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
glider it's just a regular plane it
doesn't<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.750> matter<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.860> opinion<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
scroll down to mixing click on that and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
scroll down to mixing click on that and
what<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to create a mix specific mix - mix 1 so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440 
to create a mix specific mix - mix 1 so
just<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> be

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
going to change the race so it's I have

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.840 
going to change the race so it's I have
mine<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.040> negative<00:01:47.520> 40<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.290> that's<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.850> that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
mine at negative 40 and that's it that's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
mine at negative 40 and that's it that's
all<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.659> -<00:01:51.780> elevator<00:01:52.170> and

all you have to do here - elevator and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.920 
all you have to do here - elevator and
negative<00:01:53.430> 40<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.210> happens<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.750> when

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
negative 40 what happens is that when

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
negative 40 what happens is that when
you<00:01:55.020> press<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.619> gear<00:01:57.140> switch<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.770> gear

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you press the gear switch the gear

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
you press the gear switch the gear
switch<00:01:59.219> moves<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.850> thing<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
switch moves the thing for that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899 
switch moves the thing for that
and<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.840> elevator<00:02:01.290> goes<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:02.759> your

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and the elevator goes up so that's your

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.370 
and the elevator goes up so that's your
launch<00:02:03.149> preset<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:03.869> once<00:02:04.170> you're<00:02:04.350> done

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
launch preset and then once you're done

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
launch preset and then once you're done
with<00:02:04.740> launching<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.579> flip<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> down

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
with launching you just flip that down

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.880 
with launching you just flip that down
the<00:02:06.329> elevator

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the elevator

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.639 
the elevator
dhania<00:02:07.330> simple<00:02:08.330> enough<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.660> that's<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:09.170> that

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
dhania simple enough and that's all that

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.070 
dhania simple enough and that's all that
the<00:02:09.770> launch<00:02:09.950> preset<00:02:10.369> really<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.810> that

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the launch preset really is so that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.260 
the launch preset really is so that
works<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:12.530> well<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:14.590> flaps<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.270> thermal

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
works really well for flaps and thermal

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.550 
works really well for flaps and thermal
modes<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.660> stuff<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.260> have<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.410> go

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
modes and stuff like that you have to go

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.680 
modes and stuff like that you have to go
to<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> flap<00:02:18.920> system<00:02:19.400> right<00:02:20.120> now<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.660> a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
to a flap system right now I just have a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.280 
to a flap system right now I just have a
normal<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.290> land<00:02:21.590> however<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.959> change

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
normal in a land however you can change

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.949 
normal in a land however you can change
this<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.550> have<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.060> my<00:02:26.330> flight<00:02:26.780> mode

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
this so that I have it on my flight mode

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.270 
this so that I have it on my flight mode
switch<00:02:27.320> which<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.100> up<00:02:28.870> here<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:31.220> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
switch which is up here so it's this is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.370 
switch which is up here so it's this is
my<00:02:31.520> launch<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.030> then<00:02:32.120> that's<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.600> land<00:02:32.959> right

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
my launch and then that's the land right

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.320 
my launch and then that's the land right
there<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.700> settle<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.180> your

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
there but you can settle up on your

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.970 
there but you can settle up on your
flaps<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.500> thermal<00:02:36.860> in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
flaps so that you have the thermal in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.350 
flaps so that you have the thermal in
the<00:02:37.069> middle<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:37.520> land<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> bottom

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
the middle and then land on the bottom

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.930 
the middle and then land on the bottom
or<00:02:38.600> something<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> all<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.790> have

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
or something like that so all you have

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
or something like that so all you have
to<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:42.260> change<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.160> switch<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:44.560> flap<00:02:45.560> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
to do is change the switch to flap and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.100 
to do is change the switch to flap and
you<00:02:46.190> immediately<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.730> three<00:02:47.510> settings<00:02:47.900> so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
you immediately have three settings so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.290 
you immediately have three settings so
you<00:02:48.140> can<00:02:48.350> do<00:02:48.500> mid<00:02:49.070> can<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.700> your<00:02:49.850> thermal

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
you can do mid can just be your thermal

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.330 
you can do mid can just be your thermal
mode<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.440> eventually<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.890> am<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.220> and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
mode and I think eventually I am in and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.240 
mode and I think eventually I am in and
do<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.690> future<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.709> can<00:02:54.830> do<00:02:54.950> flight

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
do that in the future you can do flight

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.300 
do that in the future you can do flight
mode<00:02:55.459> mix<00:02:57.100> gear<00:02:58.100> or<00:02:58.610> inhibit<00:02:59.300> so<00:03:00.310> that's

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
mode mix gear or inhibit so that's

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.370 
mode mix gear or inhibit so that's
basically<00:03:01.700> I've<00:03:01.910> done<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> binary<00:03:02.600> 900

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
basically I've done with the binary 900

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.080 
basically I've done with the binary 900
it's<00:03:03.590> working<00:03:03.890> pretty<00:03:04.100> well<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.370> far<00:03:04.790> I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
it's working pretty well so far I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
it's working pretty well so far I
haven't<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:05.870> got<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> lot<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.380> flight<00:03:06.739> time

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
haven't really got a lot of flight time

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.330 
haven't really got a lot of flight time
underneath<00:03:07.390> under<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.070> while<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.190> say

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
underneath under the while I say

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.710 
underneath under the while I say
underneath<00:03:11.200> under<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.440> binary<00:03:13.100> 900<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:14.209> that

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
underneath under the binary 900 is that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.569 
underneath under the binary 900 is that
works<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:18.220> think<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.489> say

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
works and I think it's going to say

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.020 
works and I think it's going to say
under<00:03:19.700> my<00:03:19.910> belt<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.450> I'm<00:03:20.540> not<00:03:20.600> sure<00:03:20.780> weird

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
under my belt with it I'm not sure weird

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.210 
under my belt with it I'm not sure weird
so<00:03:23.049> that's<00:03:24.049> basically<00:03:24.350> we<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> program<00:03:24.920> my

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
so that's basically we have a program my

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.350 
so that's basically we have a program my
dlg<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.940> lot<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.250> timers<00:03:28.250> going<00:03:28.489> from<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.910> lot

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
dlg a lot of the timers going from a lot

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.270 
dlg a lot of the timers going from a lot
of<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.600> high-end<00:03:30.320> deals<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.860> guys<00:03:31.040> will

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
of the high-end deals you guys will

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.630 
of the high-end deals you guys will
never<00:03:31.459> recommend<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:32.090> DX<00:03:32.390> 7s<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:33.230> dlg<00:03:33.920> but<00:03:34.489> this

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
never recommend a DX 7s for dlg but this

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.550 
never recommend a DX 7s for dlg but this
is<00:03:34.760> how<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:34.910> made<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.209> work<00:03:35.510> with<00:03:35.900> my<00:03:36.049> presets

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
is how I made it work with my presets

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
is how I made it work with my presets
and<00:03:36.739> stuff<00:03:36.890> like<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.670> course<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.000> doesn't

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
and stuff like that of course it doesn't

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.880 
and stuff like that of course it doesn't
have<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.360> specific<00:03:38.480> flight<00:03:39.019> mode<00:03:39.200> mixing<00:03:39.620> stuff

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
have a specific flight mode mixing stuff

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.710 
have a specific flight mode mixing stuff
like<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.280> but<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.790> get<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.239> work<00:03:41.450> for

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
like that but you can get it to work for

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.930 
like that but you can get it to work for
what<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.680> need<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.950> do<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.310> as<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.549> can<00:03:43.640> see<00:03:43.820> it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
what you need to do so as you can see it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.620 
what you need to do so as you can see it
says<00:03:44.060> normal<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.630> flip<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.590> switch<00:03:46.630> whoops

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
says normal I flip the switch whoops

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.620 
says normal I flip the switch whoops
wait<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.040> change<00:03:49.489> this<00:03:49.690> yeah<00:03:50.690> whoops<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
wait and just change this yeah whoops so

now it says normal

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.470 
now it says normal
that's<00:03:57.470> just<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:58.579> doesn't<00:03:58.760> say<00:03:59.000> launch<00:03:59.239> when<00:03:59.450> I

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
that's just it doesn't say launch when I

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
hits land right on the flap so it would

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.050
