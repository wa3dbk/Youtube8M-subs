00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920 
would always play basketball outside and
they<00:00:44.160> were<00:00:44.190> bigger<00:00:44.489> bigger<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.360> me<00:00:45.480> stronger

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
than me better than me so I'd have to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
than me better than me so I'd have to
find<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:49.170> something<00:00:49.469> better<00:00:49.620> than

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
find a way to do something better than

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
find a way to do something better than
them<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.789> times<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.420> some

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
them so a lot of times I would do some

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
them so a lot of times I would do some
trick<00:00:51.840> shots<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.379> something<00:00:52.410> creative<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> see

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
trick shots or something creative to see

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.770

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
if they could do that that was my only

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
if they could do that that was my only
way<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.379> better<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.520> over<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
way to be better and I think over the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549
