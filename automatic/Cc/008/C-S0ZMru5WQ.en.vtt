00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.790
 tree hurting the foot and causing 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 that more apples fall on you you think 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.340

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.280
 complaints since I got here in first 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.500
 trailer is a cryptic how is it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.790
 living with it demanded better ones 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 living conditions 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.050

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.270
 nothing better than one that's expected 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 where he has visited outside 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.490
 and why I go to seafood and new milk 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.830

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.830
 what trying to eat we respect 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.539

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.360
 letters of this thing I already told you is 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.540
 magic but the magic is not real then 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.519
 how do you explain that I said things 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.560
 Including you very simple a house 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.970
 equipped with a magnet mechanism and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.500
 ropes because I would use fake soccer magic 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.950
 show me that she is wrong will be a 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.190
 pleasure is pique not 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.160

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.370
 how it works was horrible nor 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 I do not even feel anything at the moment 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.700
 final 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.310
 I've wasted all this time 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.519
 doing secondary missions all those 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.980
 big decisions just for a generic 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.260
 final partner with no relation to anything in the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 story I have no idea what 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.180

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.840
 paint salt from here and stain as the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.540
 game 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.709

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.480
 shock to accuse me of such an act so 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.130
 professionally wrapped for this 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.800
 gifts that because I do not trust 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.590
 in that sane and cheerful man all the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.410
 years went into my house without my permission to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.800
 take milledge to eat my cookies 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.610

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.970
 Leave her alone but it's mine, not the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.940
 you use is a matter of principles you do not

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.030
 Pegasus unicorns and ponies 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.690
 terrestrials left aside their 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.300
 In addition to equestrian differences found 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.150

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.190

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.870
 that every time it goes away I try 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.680
 do some effect because it 's simply 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.500

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.880

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.480
