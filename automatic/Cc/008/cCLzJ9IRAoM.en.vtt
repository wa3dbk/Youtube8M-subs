00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.519
 78 years 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.519
 I'm also at work 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.730
 Brother rescued a very popular woman at work

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 What to lower 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.589
 Ori move 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.259
 The first 100 billion yen 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.259
 me too 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.649
 That's why gamers are so bad at first glance 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.080
 You can maintain this 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 It is an impression of the yen appreciation basics Stop 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 Hiroshi Miyajima 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.530
 Gamer's 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.380
 Because it is a judgment of 30 years going back to new Osaka 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.340
 Nagara Kawakai came up 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 Move back and forth in the low price area 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.330
 It is big to put in before 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 Everyone is similar 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.520
 Suddenly 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.510
 Clear human resources excavated 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.320
 For example 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.790
 1927 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.050
 I felt good 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.390
 Anjo is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.990
 Move to that moment 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.210
 Anrakuji Temple 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 Even under the snow 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960
 There were still many mystery 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.360
 It is the US media 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.410

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.880
 Always 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.500
 There was that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.740
 It will be held at the station's home but it will not change much 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.040
 In Ebina City side 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 More than 5 days if it becomes stable 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340
 It's because I think in various ways 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.700
 Lively 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.869
 I'm thinking it's friendship now 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.450
 It is movie April

 75 years old 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.539
 In the way 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.399
 It's all Essenne that it is finished as it is 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.919
 That's all 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.349
 But that 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.300
 British 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
 I can think 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.889
 I can not understand 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.789
 It is big 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.639
 There were a lot of troubles 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.429
 It is to match over 1 yen against the dollar 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.380
 reaction 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.380
 It is a question 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.629
 Well in that situation 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.209

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.739
 Kilo in the heart 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.499

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.289

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.959
 Mutual communication tools 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.399
 Mainly important 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.739
 If it can 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.029
 What I thought 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.979
 I can tell my father 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.739
 You can do it 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.859
