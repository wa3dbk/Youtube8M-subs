did you do ramen here in today's lake
we're<00:00:06.660> gonna<00:00:06.839> talk<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.500> minor

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
we're gonna talk about the minor

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.410 
we're gonna talk about the minor
pentatonic<00:00:07.830> scale<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.730> we're<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
pentatonic scale and we're going to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
pentatonic scale and we're going to
extend<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.440> first<00:00:10.679> position<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> minor

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
extend the first position of the minor

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.089 
extend the first position of the minor
pentatonic<00:00:12.120> scale<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.840> include<00:00:13.230> notes<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
second position of the minor pentatonic

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800 
second position of the minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:16.830> let<00:00:17.520> me<00:00:17.609> show<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> key

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
scale let me show you we're in the key

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.510 
scale let me show you we're in the key
of<00:00:18.840> C<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.800> position<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> C

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
of C and the first position of the C

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.910 
of C and the first position of the C
minor<00:00:20.699> pentatonic<00:00:21.060> scale<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.560> one<00:00:22.769> right

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
minor pentatonic scale is this one right

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.700 
minor pentatonic scale is this one right
here<00:00:26.779> let's<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.930> look<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> second

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
here let's not look at the second

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.000 
here let's not look at the second
position<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.670> C<00:00:29.910> minor<00:00:30.359> pentatonic<00:00:30.720> scale

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.650 

if<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.309> these<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:35.520> positions<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.420> make

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
if I take these two positions and make

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.450 
if I take these two positions and make
one<00:00:36.989> position<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.129> gonna<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
one position out of two I'm gonna have

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
one position out of two I'm gonna have
what<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> call<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.030> extended<00:00:39.600> minor<00:00:40.170> pentatonic

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
what I call an extended minor pentatonic

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
what I call an extended minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:41.070> you're<00:00:41.640> combining<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
scale you're combining the first in the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
scale you're combining the first in the
second<00:00:43.350> position<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> minor<00:00:44.219> pentatonic

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
second position of that minor pentatonic

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490 
second position of that minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.180> gonna<00:00:45.329> create<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.050> three<00:00:46.350> note

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
scale that's gonna create a three note

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.670 
scale that's gonna create a three note
per<00:00:46.530> string<00:00:47.390> pentatonic<00:00:48.390> scale<00:00:49.140> here's<00:00:49.500> how

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
per string pentatonic scale here's how

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
per string pentatonic scale here's how
it<00:00:49.800> sounds<00:00:52.640> notice<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.000> notes<00:00:54.210> they're

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it sounds notice these two notes they're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420 
it sounds notice these two notes they're
the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.260> notice<00:00:55.590> they're<00:00:55.710> being<00:00:55.739> repeated

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the same notice they're being repeated

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
the same notice they're being repeated
every<00:00:57.420> third<00:00:58.079> note<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
every third note you're gonna have a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:09.950 
every third note you're gonna have a
repetition<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.880> forth<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
repetition and so forth this is the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.640 
repetition and so forth this is the
whole<00:01:10.170> shape<00:01:10.860> played<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.909> once

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.610 

let's<00:01:17.310> play<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.000> legato<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.470> going

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
let's play that and legato so I'm going

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.400 
let's play that and legato so I'm going
to<00:01:19.650> strike<00:01:20.010> each<00:01:20.250> string<00:01:21.090> only<00:01:21.570> once<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> then

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
to strike each string only once and then

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.480 
to strike each string only once and then
the<00:01:22.590> rest<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> play<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.340> by

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the rest is going to play it by

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
the rest is going to play it by
hammering<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:25.290> notes<00:01:25.620> on<00:01:25.920> each<00:01:26.160> set

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hammering on the other notes on each set

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.410 
hammering on the other notes on each set
of<00:01:26.490> strings<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.570> slow<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:36.300> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of strings here it is really slow and to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.970 
of strings here it is really slow and to
finish<00:01:36.660> this<00:01:36.810> lick<00:01:37.080> I'm<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> slide<00:01:37.770> that
