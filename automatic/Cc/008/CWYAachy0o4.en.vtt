leg behind they step slide and change

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
leg behind they step slide and change
positions<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.260> here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
positions right here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.090 
positions right here
not<00:02:14.040> only<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.610> good<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.380> throws

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
not only is this good for for a throws
