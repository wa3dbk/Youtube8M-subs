00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
technique that I just started using

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.269 
technique that I just started using
recently<00:00:28.509> so<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.259> delvis<00:00:29.710> quick<00:00:29.890> technique

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
recently so a delvis quick technique

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.499 
recently so a delvis quick technique
basically<00:00:30.609> goes<00:00:30.730> like<00:00:30.819> this<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.179> I'm<00:00:31.300> using

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
basically goes like this and I'm using

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.349 
basically goes like this and I'm using
only<00:00:31.720> four<00:00:32.050> back<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.609> also<00:00:33.609> you<00:00:33.850> can<00:00:34.090> use<00:00:34.239> this

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
only four back and also you can use this

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.180 
only four back and also you can use this
for<00:00:34.510> any<00:00:34.690> type<00:00:34.899> of<00:00:34.930> combing<00:00:35.379> movement<00:00:35.710> so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
for any type of combing movement so

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.090 
for any type of combing movement so
let's<00:00:36.579> say<00:00:36.730> you're<00:00:36.910> doing<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.420> one-arm<00:00:37.960> roll<00:00:38.230> so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
let's say you're doing a one-arm roll so

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.670 
let's say you're doing a one-arm roll so
normally<00:00:39.579> we<00:00:39.699> go<00:00:39.879> one<00:00:40.090> our<00:00:40.180> rule<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:41.410> had<00:00:41.590> to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
normally we go one our rule you had to

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.319 
normally we go one our rule you had to
grab<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.859> dumbbell<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.550> would<00:00:42.699> come<00:00:42.910> up<00:00:43.090> and

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
grab a dumbbell you would come up and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.259 
grab a dumbbell you would come up and
they'd<00:00:44.170> come<00:00:44.379> back<00:00:44.590> down<00:00:44.859> so<00:00:45.640> when<00:00:46.149> you're

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
they'd come back down so when you're

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.880 
they'd come back down so when you're
doing<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.510> double<00:00:46.870> squeeze<00:00:47.140> what<00:00:47.410> you<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
doing a double squeeze what you do is

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.160 
doing a double squeeze what you do is
you're<00:00:48.039> actually<00:00:48.269> coming<00:00:49.269> up<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.780> you're

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
you're actually coming up and you're

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're actually coming up and you're
going<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.379> do<00:00:50.910> 2<00:00:51.910> times<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.660> contraction<00:00:53.260> you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
going to do 2 times the contraction you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.139 
going to do 2 times the contraction you
got<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.620> do<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:53.710> double<00:00:53.980> contraction<00:00:54.670> on<00:00:54.850> the

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
got to do a double contraction on the

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.930 
got to do a double contraction on the
top<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.960> make<00:00:56.230> sure<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.620> get<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:56.949> get<00:00:57.730> that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
top to make sure you get that get that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.180 
top to make sure you get that get that
extra<00:00:58.480> squeeze<00:00:58.929> in<00:00:59.199> so<00:00:59.710> it's<00:00:59.800> kind<00:00:59.949> of<00:00:59.980> like

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
extra squeeze in so it's kind of like

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.530 
extra squeeze in so it's kind of like
this<00:01:00.460> if<00:01:00.760> you're<00:01:00.879> doing<00:01:00.999> a<00:01:01.149> set<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:02.579> 1<00:01:03.579> what

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
this if you're doing a set what 1 what

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
this if you're doing a set what 1 what
this<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.869> going<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.079> do<00:01:05.199> for<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.689> forces

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
this is going to do for you is it forces

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.380 
this is going to do for you is it forces
you<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.740> work<00:01:08.979> your<00:01:09.460> muscles<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:10.180> much

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
you to work your muscles that much

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.330 
you to work your muscles that much
harder<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:10.869> during<00:01:11.650> this<00:01:11.770> time<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.070> you're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
harder and during this time that you're

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.429 
harder and during this time that you're
shortening<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.880> muscle<00:01:13.240> because<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.290> that

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
shortening the muscle because of that

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.649 
shortening the muscle because of that
double<00:01:14.860> squeeze<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.939> going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.270> base<00:01:16.420> it's

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
double squeeze it's going to base it's

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.230 
double squeeze it's going to base it's
almost<00:01:16.899> like<00:01:17.110> doing<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.439> rep<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.829> half

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
almost like doing a rep and a half

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.280 
almost like doing a rep and a half
overtime<00:01:19.240> what's<00:01:19.540> going<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.689> happen<00:01:20.049> is<00:01:20.170> in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
overtime what's going to happen is in

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.690 
overtime what's going to happen is in
the<00:01:20.320> beginning<00:01:20.680> with<00:01:20.770> doing<00:01:20.979> your<00:01:21.100> set<00:01:21.340> you're

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
the beginning with doing your set you're

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.280 
the beginning with doing your set you're
going<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.880> find<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.360> can<00:01:22.540> do<00:01:22.869> it<00:01:23.020> pretty

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
going to find that you can do it pretty

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.929 
going to find that you can do it pretty
easily<00:01:23.470> because<00:01:24.009> you're<00:01:24.100> pretty<00:01:24.280> fresh<00:01:24.579> and

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
easily because you're pretty fresh and

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.999 
easily because you're pretty fresh and
you<00:01:25.509> may<00:01:25.689> let<00:01:25.960> your<00:01:26.110> weight<00:01:26.320> come<00:01:26.530> down<00:01:26.770> may

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
you may let your weight come down may

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.179 
you may let your weight come down may
about<00:01:27.280> 2<00:01:27.579> inches<00:01:27.909> 3<00:01:28.240> inches<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:29.290> enough<00:01:29.740> to

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
about 2 inches 3 inches just enough to

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.340 
about 2 inches 3 inches just enough to
go<00:01:30.369> ahead<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.030> extend<00:01:31.659> out<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.869> muscle<00:01:32.320> a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
go ahead and extend out the muscle a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.770 
go ahead and extend out the muscle a
little<00:01:32.590> bit<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.920> then<00:01:33.280> contract<00:01:33.729> again<00:01:34.060> but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
little bit and then contract again but

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.950 
little bit and then contract again but
what<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.049> found<00:01:35.380> though

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
what I found though

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.260 
what I found though
as<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.500> started<00:01:36.799> doing<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.220> for<00:01:37.520> every<00:01:37.940> single

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
as I started doing this for every single

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.719 
as I started doing this for every single
exercise<00:01:38.540> by<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.500> time<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> got<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.100> my<00:01:40.280> third

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
exercise by the time I got to my third

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.680 
exercise by the time I got to my third
fourth<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.479> fifth<00:01:41.570> exercise<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.820> was<00:01:44.060> really

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
fourth and fifth exercise it was really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.620 
fourth and fifth exercise it was really
really<00:01:44.930> hard<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.400> be<00:01:46.550> able<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:47.030> for

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
really hard just to be able to for

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.170 
really hard just to be able to for
example<00:01:48.110> come<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.400> was<00:01:49.550> coming<00:01:49.729> down<00:01:50.000> I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
example come up as I was coming down I

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.359 
example come up as I was coming down I
was<00:01:50.390> fighting<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.110> negative<00:01:51.740> coming<00:01:52.130> down

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
was fighting the negative coming down

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.969 
was fighting the negative coming down
and<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.000> had<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.330> come<00:01:53.990> right<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:54.350> up<00:01:54.409> again

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and I had to come right back up again

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.850 
and I had to come right back up again
and<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:56.000> became<00:01:56.360> almost<00:01:56.659> like<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.350> can<00:01:57.590> tell

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
and it became almost like I can tell

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.430 
and it became almost like I can tell
that<00:01:58.460> my<00:01:58.610> muscles<00:01:58.820> were<00:01:59.210> becoming<00:01:59.690> fatigued<00:02:00.320> a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
that my muscles were becoming fatigued a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.030 
that my muscles were becoming fatigued a
lot<00:02:00.649> faster<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:02.030> muscle<00:02:02.720> under<00:02:02.960> tension<00:02:03.259> was

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
lot faster the muscle under tension was

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.730 
lot faster the muscle under tension was
a<00:02:04.070> lot<00:02:04.340> more<00:02:04.610> if<00:02:04.820> you're<00:02:05.000> doing<00:02:05.180> regularly<00:02:06.170> ten

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
a lot more if you're doing regularly ten

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.630 
a lot more if you're doing regularly ten
reps<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.209> state<00:02:08.509> four<00:02:08.720> sets<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
reps for the state four sets now on the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
reps for the state four sets now on the
last<00:02:10.789> two<00:02:11.120> sets<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.690> you're<00:02:11.840> going<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.140> do<00:02:12.290> this

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
last two sets if you're going to do this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.500 
last two sets if you're going to do this
double<00:02:12.830> squeeze<00:02:13.010> technique<00:02:13.360> even<00:02:14.360> though<00:02:14.450> you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
double squeeze technique even though you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.900 
double squeeze technique even though you
may<00:02:14.750> still<00:02:15.019> be<00:02:15.140> doing<00:02:15.410> ten<00:02:15.620> repetitions<00:02:15.910> but

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
may still be doing ten repetitions but

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.699 
may still be doing ten repetitions but
in<00:02:17.090> all<00:02:17.360> reality<00:02:17.390> you're<00:02:18.200> probably<00:02:18.470> doing

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
in all reality you're probably doing

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.100 
in all reality you're probably doing
something<00:02:19.220> online<00:02:19.430> maybe<00:02:19.880> fifteen<00:02:20.480> sixteen

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
something online maybe fifteen sixteen

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.259 
something online maybe fifteen sixteen
repetitions<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.640> normal<00:02:22.880> reps

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
repetitions but not just normal reps

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.180 
repetitions but not just normal reps
because<00:02:23.780> you're<00:02:24.080> focusing<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.130> that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
because you're focusing on that on that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.100 
because you're focusing on that on that
shortening<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.120> muscle<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.019> going

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
shortening of the muscle so it's going

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.750 
shortening of the muscle so it's going
to<00:02:27.170> allow<00:02:27.320> your<00:02:27.500> muscles<00:02:27.650> become<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> lot<00:02:28.550> more

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
to allow your muscles become a lot more

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.180 
to allow your muscles become a lot more
dense<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.239> lot<00:02:29.390> more<00:02:29.630> fuller<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:30.950> gonna<00:02:31.070> go

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
dense a lot more fuller so I'm gonna go

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.590 
dense a lot more fuller so I'm gonna go
and<00:02:31.400> run<00:02:31.519> through<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> lot<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.060> examples<00:02:32.330> here

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
and run through a lot of examples here

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.460 
and run through a lot of examples here
then<00:02:33.050> overall<00:02:33.320> you'll<00:02:33.830> come<00:02:34.069> down<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:35.209> do

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
then overall you'll come down you do

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.990 
then overall you'll come down you do
roll<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:36.650> regular<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.519> when<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.730> come<00:02:37.880> up

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
roll like regular so when you come up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.620 
roll like regular so when you come up
just<00:02:38.530> like<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:47.170> most<00:02:48.170> people<00:02:48.560> skip<00:02:48.799> out<00:02:49.130> on

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
just like that most people skip out on

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.780 
just like that most people skip out on
the<00:02:50.630> full<00:02:50.840> extension<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> also<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.519> fully

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the full extension and also on the fully

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.120 
the full extension and also on the fully
shorten<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.049> if<00:02:54.230> you're<00:02:54.380> doing<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.799> roll<00:02:55.100> for

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
shorten so if you're doing a roll for

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.789 
shorten so if you're doing a roll for
example<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.940> lot<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.570> people<00:02:56.870> work<00:02:57.140> only<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
example a lot of people work only the

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.490 
example a lot of people work only the
middle<00:02:58.130> they'll<00:02:58.579> do<00:02:58.730> something<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.150> this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
middle they'll do something like this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770 
middle they'll do something like this
instead<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.620> fully<00:03:01.040> extending<00:03:01.730> out<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.209> fully

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
instead of fully extending out and fully

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.259 
instead of fully extending out and fully
contract<00:03:03.500> me<00:03:03.590> back<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.610> we're<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.000> have

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
contract me back do we're going to have

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.229 
contract me back do we're going to have
the<00:03:05.420> arms<00:03:05.540> Bend<00:03:06.410> right<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.579> they<00:03:08.090> kind

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the arms Bend right here and they kind

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.440 
the arms Bend right here and they kind
of<00:03:08.329> go<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.340> mean<00:03:10.340> yeah<00:03:10.940> you're<00:03:11.329> going

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
of go like this I mean yeah you're going

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.640 
of go like this I mean yeah you're going
to<00:03:11.510> work<00:03:11.750> some<00:03:12.019> muscle

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
to work some muscle

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.710 
to work some muscle
you<00:03:12.920> notice<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.310> never<00:03:13.549> lock<00:03:13.880> out<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.329> you

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
you notice you never lock out and you

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800 
you notice you never lock out and you
never<00:03:14.900> come<00:03:15.140> up<00:03:15.320> high<00:03:15.530> enough<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.670> by<00:03:17.480> doing

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
never come up high enough so by doing

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.539 
never come up high enough so by doing
the<00:03:17.900> double<00:03:18.110> squeeze<00:03:18.440> technique<00:03:18.709> what<00:03:19.400> you're

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
the double squeeze technique what you're

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.759 
the double squeeze technique what you're
doing<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:19.970> you're<00:03:20.150> basically<00:03:20.570> forcing<00:03:21.109> your

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
doing is you're basically forcing your

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.380 
doing is you're basically forcing your
bodies<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.190> do<00:03:22.400> double<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.880> amount<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.239> work

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
bodies to do double the amount of work

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.259 
bodies to do double the amount of work
on<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.140> shortening<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:25.280> also<00:03:25.459> keep<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.030> mind

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
on the shortening but also keep in mind

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.660 
on the shortening but also keep in mind
that<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.470> want<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.859> also<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.310> full

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
that you want to also have that full

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.210 
that you want to also have that full
extension<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:30.049> only<00:03:30.380> thing<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.769> don't<00:03:31.010> want

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
extension the only thing you don't want

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.250 
extension the only thing you don't want
to<00:03:31.310> change<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.090> amount<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.630> weight<00:03:32.959> that

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
to change is the amount of weight that

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360 
to change is the amount of weight that
you<00:03:33.680> regularly<00:03:34.100> use<00:03:34.160> for<00:03:34.640> your<00:03:34.730> back

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
you regularly use for your back

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
you regularly use for your back
let's<00:03:35.760> say<00:03:35.849> you're<00:03:36.000> using<00:03:36.030> 50<00:03:36.569> pounds<00:03:36.870> for

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
let's say you're using 50 pounds for

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.300 
let's say you're using 50 pounds for
example<00:03:37.440> don't<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.360> 35<00:03:39.360> pounds<00:03:39.989> or<00:03:40.349> 40

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
example don't go to 35 pounds or 40

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610 
example don't go to 35 pounds or 40
pounds<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.239> technique<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.379> whole

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
pounds to do this technique the whole

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.140 
pounds to do this technique the whole
idea<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.760> exercise<00:03:45.000> more

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
idea is to make the exercise more

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.900 
idea is to make the exercise more
challenging<00:03:46.140> challenge<00:03:47.040> your<00:03:47.160> muscles<00:03:47.519> work

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
challenging challenge your muscles work

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.610 
challenging challenge your muscles work
it<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> lot<00:03:48.269> more<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.959> lower<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.410> weight

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
it a lot more if you lower the weight

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.830 
it a lot more if you lower the weight
and<00:03:49.890> you're<00:03:50.489> doing<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.790> technique<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.599> may

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and you're doing this technique you may

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.180 
and you're doing this technique you may
have<00:03:52.200> more<00:03:53.190> intense<00:03:53.790> workout<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:55.049> you're<00:03:55.950> not

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
have more intense workout but you're not

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.890 
have more intense workout but you're not
going<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.730> an<00:03:56.910> equal<00:03:57.269> you're<00:03:57.629> not<00:03:57.780> going

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
going to have an equal you're not going

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.330 
going to have an equal you're not going
to<00:03:57.959> have<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> better<00:03:58.500> workout<00:03:58.920> than<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.190> last

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to have a better workout than the last

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.729 
to have a better workout than the last
one<00:03:59.670> because<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.660> weight<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.049> using<00:04:01.440> now<00:04:01.590> is

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
one because the weight that using now is

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.009 
one because the weight that using now is
a<00:04:01.769> lot<00:04:02.010> less<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.640> point<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.690> do<00:04:03.840> exactly

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
a lot less the point is to do exactly

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.140 
a lot less the point is to do exactly
what<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.590> normally<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:05.099> but<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.580> want<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:05.970> add

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
what you normally do but you want to add

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.360 
what you normally do but you want to add
in<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.569> technique<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.470> next<00:04:07.829> time<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.250> do

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
in this technique the next time you do

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
in this technique the next time you do
back<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.209> be<00:04:09.390> doing<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.989> biceps

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
back you can be doing this with biceps

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.089 
back you can be doing this with biceps
and<00:04:10.620> heat<00:04:10.739> up<00:04:10.890> only<00:04:11.130> move<00:04:11.340> back<00:04:12.030> biceps

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
and heat up only move back biceps

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.380 
and heat up only move back biceps
hamstrings<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:14.549> let's<00:04:14.700> say<00:04:14.819> you're<00:04:14.970> doing<00:04:15.090> up

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
hamstrings so let's say you're doing up

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.349 
hamstrings so let's say you're doing up
let's<00:04:16.200> say<00:04:16.290> you're<00:04:16.410> doing<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.680> over<00:04:16.799> fly<00:04:17.359> come

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
let's say you're doing it over fly come

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.080 
let's say you're doing it over fly come
up<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.780> down<00:04:19.260> now<00:04:19.739> double<00:04:20.489> squeak<00:04:20.700> technique

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
up and down now double squeak technique

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.440 
up and down now double squeak technique
up<00:04:21.660> up<00:04:22.410> down<00:04:23.160> up<00:04:23.669> up<00:04:24.590> yeah<00:04:25.880> there<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.090> go<00:04:27.120> right

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
up up down up up yeah there you go right

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.580 
up up down up up yeah there you go right
here<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:29.340> notice<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.669> only<00:04:29.850> coming<00:04:30.180> down

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
here so you notice I'm only coming down

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.070 
here so you notice I'm only coming down
just<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.710> couple<00:04:31.919> inches<00:04:32.190> or<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.700> but<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:33.840> you

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
just a couple inches or so but as you

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.170 
just a couple inches or so but as you
get<00:04:34.229> very<00:04:34.500> fatigued<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.130> may<00:04:35.280> come<00:04:35.520> up<00:04:35.699> and

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
get very fatigued you may come up and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.990 
get very fatigued you may come up and
you<00:04:36.389> almost<00:04:36.750> come<00:04:36.960> down<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.580> force<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.820> right

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
you almost come down you force it right

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.120 
you almost come down you force it right
back<00:04:39.150> up<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:40.110> will<00:04:40.530> be<00:04:40.680> doing<00:04:40.830> that

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
back up so you will be doing that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.950 
back up so you will be doing that
throughout<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.610> sets<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.120> that's<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.780> key

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
throughout the sets and that's the key

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.659 
throughout the sets and that's the key
point<00:04:43.229> here<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.620> allow<00:04:44.010> your<00:04:44.160> muscles<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.490> work

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
point here to allow your muscles to work

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.440 
point here to allow your muscles to work
down<00:04:44.850> much<00:04:45.000> harder

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
down much harder

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.850 
down much harder
we<00:04:45.539> were<00:04:45.630> going<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.840> do<00:04:45.930> something<00:04:46.139> for<00:04:46.320> biceps

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
we were going to do something for biceps

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.070 
we were going to do something for biceps
same<00:04:47.400> thing<00:04:47.669> come<00:04:48.600> up<00:04:48.680> come<00:04:49.680> down<00:04:49.950> squeeze

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
same thing come up come down squeeze

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.839 
same thing come up come down squeeze
right<00:04:52.080> back<00:04:52.289> down<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:53.190> ever<00:04:53.340> seen<00:04:53.490> anybody<00:04:53.639> do

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
right back down you ever seen anybody do

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.360 
right back down you ever seen anybody do
20<00:04:54.120> ones<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.720> know<00:04:54.840> they<00:04:54.960> do<00:04:55.220> seven<00:04:56.220> right

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
20 ones you know they do seven right

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.279 
20 ones you know they do seven right
here<00:04:56.760> then<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.180> goes<00:04:57.300> seven<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.720> middle<00:04:58.020> and

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
here then it goes seven the middle and

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.830 
here then it goes seven the middle and
seven<00:04:58.710> on<00:04:58.830> top<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.789> the<00:05:00.300> idea<00:05:00.570> here<00:05:00.660> is

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
seven on top so the idea here is

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.770 
seven on top so the idea here is
basically<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.710> do<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.979> seven<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:02.610> top<00:05:03.240> except

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
basically to do the seven on top except

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.940 
basically to do the seven on top except
instead<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:04.110> doing<00:05:04.320> seven<00:05:04.620> you're<00:05:04.770> gonna<00:05:04.889> do

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
instead of doing seven you're gonna do

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.159 
instead of doing seven you're gonna do
it<00:05:05.039> on<00:05:05.099> every<00:05:05.220> single<00:05:05.460> rep<00:05:05.789> on<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.630> last<00:05:06.840> two

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
it on every single rep on the last two

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.230 
it on every single rep on the last two
sets<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.560> your<00:05:07.680> exercise<00:05:08.099> let<00:05:08.760> me<00:05:08.849> help<00:05:09.000> you

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
come down a few inches boom you can

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.790 
come down a few inches boom you can
really<00:05:49.790> see<00:05:50.000> how<00:05:50.540> my<00:05:50.720> back<00:05:50.900> has<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.320> do<00:05:51.440> double

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
really see how my back has to do double

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.410 
really see how my back has to do double
the<00:05:51.860> amount<00:05:52.100> of<00:05:52.190> work<00:05:52.370> right<00:05:53.120> on<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
the amount of work right on the

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.840 
the amount of work right on the
shortening<00:05:53.840> part<00:05:54.110> lap<00:05:54.440> pull<00:05:54.650> down<00:05:54.830> pull<00:05:55.130> it

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
shortening part lap pull down pull it

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.120 
shortening part lap pull down pull it
down<00:05:56.120> come<00:05:56.810> up<00:05:57.190> down<00:05:58.540> so<00:05:59.540> this<00:06:00.470> is<00:06:00.740> probably

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
down come up down so this is probably

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.970 
down come up down so this is probably
one<00:06:02.000> of<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.150> easier<00:06:02.570> exercise<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.680> do<00:06:03.830> this

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
one of the easier exercise to do this

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.240 
one of the easier exercise to do this
double<00:06:04.310> squeeze<00:06:04.520> technique<00:06:05.230> because<00:06:06.230> we<00:06:07.070> have

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
double squeeze technique because we have

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.880 
double squeeze technique because we have
a<00:06:07.280> cable<00:06:07.790> you<00:06:08.030> have<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.450> far<00:06:08.690> so<00:06:09.530> it's<00:06:09.770> loud

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
a cable you have the far so it's loud

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.020 
a cable you have the far so it's loud
like<00:06:10.100> your<00:06:10.280> arms<00:06:10.580> have<00:06:10.760> to<00:06:10.850> work

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
like your arms have to work

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.470 
like your arms have to work
independently

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.810 

this<00:06:14.480> technique<00:06:14.870> is<00:06:15.050> a<00:06:15.080> lot<00:06:15.380> harder<00:06:15.790> with<00:06:16.790> a

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
this technique is a lot harder with a

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.300 
this technique is a lot harder with a
barbell<00:06:17.420> or<00:06:17.660> with<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.710> dumbbell

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
barbell or with the dumbbell

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.420 
barbell or with the dumbbell
if<00:06:20.150> that's<00:06:20.360> all<00:06:20.510> you<00:06:20.660> got<00:06:20.890> work<00:06:21.890> with<00:06:22.130> it

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
if that's all you got work with it

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.040 
if that's all you got work with it

shortening<00:06:55.970> of<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.120> muscle<00:06:56.510> okay<00:06:57.110> your

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
shortening of the muscle okay your

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.280 
shortening of the muscle okay your
muscles<00:06:57.980> expand<00:06:58.550> out<00:06:58.790> and<00:06:59.000> then<00:06:59.510> they<00:06:59.690> shorten

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
muscles expand out and then they shorten

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.340 
muscles expand out and then they shorten
they<00:07:00.800> expand<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:01.520> they<00:07:01.850> shorten<00:07:02.330> so<00:07:02.780> if<00:07:03.170> you

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
they expand and they shorten so if you

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.380 
they expand and they shorten so if you
expand<00:07:03.920> it<00:07:04.040> out<00:07:04.190> you<00:07:04.340> create<00:07:04.550> a<00:07:04.580> big<00:07:04.790> tear<00:07:05.060> of

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
expand it out you create a big tear of

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.060 
expand it out you create a big tear of
when<00:07:05.540> you<00:07:05.630> shorten<00:07:06.080> it<00:07:06.200> continuously<00:07:06.800> you

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
when you shorten it continuously you

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.700 
when you shorten it continuously you
start<00:07:07.730> building<00:07:08.090> up<00:07:08.240> more<00:07:08.750> fuller<00:07:09.140> muscles

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
start building up more fuller muscles

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.410 
start building up more fuller muscles
okay<00:07:10.190> so<00:07:10.250> that's<00:07:10.580> what<00:07:10.760> we're<00:07:10.880> focusing<00:07:11.270> on
