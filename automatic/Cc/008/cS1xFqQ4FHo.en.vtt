deal with it you have to do the rest of
your<00:02:27.180> life<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.830> might<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:28.950> well<00:02:29.100> do<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.250> one

your life you might as well do it one
set<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.570> know<00:02:30.720> dizzy<00:02:31.310> okay<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.459> then<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
set you know dizzy okay and then the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.230 
set you know dizzy okay and then the
next<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.660> point<00:02:34.050> was<00:02:34.880> winning<00:02:35.880> college

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
next like point was winning college

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.780 
next like point was winning college
should<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.520> best

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
should you do it and I think the best

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.010 
should you do it and I think the best
time<00:02:41.030> obviously<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.570> freshman<00:02:42.990> year

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
time obviously not your freshman year

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.210 
time obviously not your freshman year
because<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> freshman<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.100> you're

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
because you're a freshman and you're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.949 
because you're a freshman and you're
still<00:02:44.430> getting<00:02:44.610> us<00:02:44.850> at<00:02:44.970> college<00:02:45.470> um<00:02:47.959> it's

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
still getting us at college um it's

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.600 
still getting us at college um it's
tough<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> say<00:02:49.530> because<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.980> did<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> program

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
tough to say because I did the program

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.380 
tough to say because I did the program
my<00:02:51.410> sophomore<00:02:52.410> year<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.790> don't<00:02:54.030> regret<00:02:54.239> it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
my sophomore year and I don't regret it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.759 
my sophomore year and I don't regret it
i<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.840> was<00:02:54.900> great<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.320> was<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> perfect

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
i think it was great it was the perfect

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.140 
i think it was great it was the perfect
timing<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.489> me<00:02:56.730> personally<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.190> which

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
timing for me personally but if I which

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.710 
timing for me personally but if I which
would<00:03:00.300> recommend<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.200> would<00:03:01.470> say<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.720> in

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
would recommend it I would say do it in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.120 
would recommend it I would say do it in
your<00:03:03.959> junior<00:03:04.110> senior<00:03:04.650> year<00:03:04.860> when<00:03:04.980> you're

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
your junior senior year when you're

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.550 
your junior senior year when you're
getting<00:03:05.220> close<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.550> being<00:03:05.730> done<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.870> because

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
getting close to being done just because

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.600 
getting close to being done just because
you<00:03:08.070> know<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.410> program's<00:03:10.800> probably<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> lot

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
you know the program's probably a lot

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.160 
you know the program's probably a lot
better<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.090> you're<00:03:12.269> over<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> age<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.780> 21

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
better when you're over the age of 21

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.890 
better when you're over the age of 21
you<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.980> less<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> lot<00:03:15.420> less<00:03:15.600> rules

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
you have a lot less not a lot less rules

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.860 
you have a lot less not a lot less rules
but<00:03:16.370> kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:18.269> make<00:03:18.390> sense<00:03:18.540> either<00:03:19.730> but

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
but kind of that make sense either but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.770 
but kind of that make sense either but
yeah<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.230> was<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.890> doing<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:23.400> you're

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
yeah I was just doing it when you're

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.930 
yeah I was just doing it when you're
older<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:25.050> college<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:26.070> ancient<00:03:26.459> like

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
older in college not like ancient like

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
older in college not like ancient like
your<00:03:27.510> last<00:03:27.720> semester<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:28.830> last

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
your last semester you can do your last

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
your last semester you can do your last
semester<00:03:29.130> not<00:03:29.910> saying<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> thinking<00:03:30.540> wrong

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
semester not saying you thinking wrong

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.780 
semester not saying you thinking wrong

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
can you do the program more than once

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.130 
can you do the program more than once
and<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.250> feel<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.329> an<00:03:37.480> obvious<00:03:37.599> answer<00:03:37.810> but

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
and I feel that's an obvious answer but

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.459 
I'll go ahead answer it yes you can do
the<00:03:39.819> program<00:03:40.150> more<00:03:40.329> than<00:03:40.450> once<00:03:40.629> I've<00:03:41.230> only

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
the program more than once I've only

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:42.839 
the program more than once I've only
done<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.739> once<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.159> I'm<00:03:42.280> going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.549> do<00:03:42.760> it

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
done it once that I'm going to do it

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.809 
done it once that I'm going to do it
again<00:03:42.909> when<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.900> graduate<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.650> i<00:03:45.459> know<00:03:45.519> i<00:03:45.640> said

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
saying when I'm doing the program but I

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.030 
saying when I'm doing the program but I
am<00:03:59.530> graduating<00:03:59.680> earlier<00:04:00.580> than<00:04:00.760> what<00:04:00.940> expected

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
as long as i don't kill myself with this

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.380 
as long as i don't kill myself with this
massive<00:04:04.810> amount<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.500> loads<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:06.010> classes<00:04:06.430> but

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
massive amount of loads of classes but

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.490 
massive amount of loads of classes but
um<00:04:07.930> i<00:04:09.120> will<00:04:10.120> be<00:04:10.209> doing<00:04:10.300> program<00:04:10.660> again<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.110> i

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
um i will be doing program again and i

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.960 
um i will be doing program again and i
recommend<00:04:11.860> doing<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.370> more<00:04:12.430> than<00:04:12.550> once<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:12.849> you

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
recommend doing it more than once if you

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.430 
recommend doing it more than once if you
want<00:04:13.150> or<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:13.450> do<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.750> once<00:04:13.900> or<00:04:14.140> do<00:04:14.319> whenever

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
want or just do it once or do whenever

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
you should do the program and I think I

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.980 
you should do the program and I think I
