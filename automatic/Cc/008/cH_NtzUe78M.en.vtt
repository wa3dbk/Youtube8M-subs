00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.990
 for six years I have been entrusted with 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.980
 presidency and artists to follow but 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.550
 it's the work of a whole team 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.130
 we have to spin off basically 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.109
 ingredients that are the hallmark of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.609
 manufactures is the guarantee of the success of 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.439
 this event to know that the the 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.570
 artists are selected by a jury 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.080
 of professional gallerists 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.490
 exhibition organizers actors of the 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.300
 departmental or regional cultural world 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.840
 and this jury changes every year and is 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.920
 totally totally totally 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 independent of the team of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.130
 organizers 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.900
 check the indications on the idea part 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.180
 texts that describe a new and 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:26.320
 characters then yes we do not find him 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:29.790
 my super other guarantee and the other the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.890
 success is that each artist 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.170
 benefits gives place that is him 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.960
 exclusively consecrated ie 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.460
 that he can present not three 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.950
 works it's not an exhibition 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.100
 collective at all it's a whole 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.069
 about fifty ephemeral galleries 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.539
 each artist can actually present 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.350
 his work 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.350
 a coherent work 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.910
 so artists to sion so that's me 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.210
 this is the second time I participate 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.530
 and I really like this way 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.570
 to organize things because I 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.510
 find that there is a human side in 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.760
 already done that allows full meetings 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.440
 different meetings so the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.260
 meeting with the people who are hosting us 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 already and then and then the people who 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.560
 come we take we take the time to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.360
 discuss with them it's not me 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.840
 I often do Paris shows 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.910
 or where everyone runs or so we 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 we have a lot of ready to move forward 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.440
 so we are very stressed while 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.080
 that's not at all the question here 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.310
 so here we really take halal had the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.500
 time to meet people who 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.360
 also take the time to look 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.340
 and then to a lot of very different people 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.410
 who come and then there is any 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.500
 the atmosphere around there that's 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.630
 very warm parties at night and 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.579
 then and then more than that 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.320
 works that is to say that as 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.210
 that artist sells things that is 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.740
 good too since there are things that 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.150
 are very nice but where there is 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.360
 no one who go so that's not the case 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.360
 right here 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.389
 quality people with a beautiful look 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.210
 because they stop they watch 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.500
 they take the time and we feel that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.349
 it's not fair 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.949
 it does not fly it was that it was 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.949
 interesting is the third ingredient 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.469
 it's the implication of very strong links 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.409
 which is established with municipalities with the 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:07.659
 people relaying private 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:12.310
 institutional and artist to follow is 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.740
 become an important part of the link 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 social in this sector of the high 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.520
 valley 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.280
 these sectors it's basically that covers the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.139
 communities of towns of quillan aude 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.139
 in the Pyrenees and the country of couiza 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.339
 100 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.899
 the extraordinary organization the reception 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.399
 homestay for not better 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:32.809
 the little attentions the little ones 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.709
 lunch meals in the evening with 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.949
 the people on the team is really 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:39.110
 extremely friendly and always 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.929
 exchanges really very very very 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.639
 how rewarding perhaps there to 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:47.479
 region I do not really know what the 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.039
 elements are going very very nice it's 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:53.919
 all that made that artist to follow 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.919
 has become a beautiful baby who has a 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.689
 notoriety an increasing audience 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:03.999
 favorable qualitative in the place 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:03.999
 Regional Artistic Even Beyond 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.660
 Yes 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.420
 at 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.830
 1 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:43.249
 at 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.470
 Oh 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.720
 the
