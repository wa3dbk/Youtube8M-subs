00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
some slight bonus now each one is going

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.310

equip that skill so you can only have

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.330 
equip that skill so you can only have
one<00:01:43.829> skill<00:01:44.759> equipped<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.540> any<00:01:45.689> given<00:01:46.049> time<00:01:46.340> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it it breaks the balance of the game or

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.600 
it it breaks the balance of the game or
anything<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:52.979> these<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.659> fairly<00:01:54.659> minor

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
anything because these are fairly minor

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
anything because these are fairly minor
perks<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.790> having<00:01:57.270> slightly<00:01:57.659> more<00:01:57.960> ammo<00:01:58.350> or
