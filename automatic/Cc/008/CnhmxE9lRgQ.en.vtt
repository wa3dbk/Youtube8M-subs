00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.859
 it 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.809
 you think well there that addressed to put it to be records 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.039
 Forgiveness is the specialty boxes with what revolves around 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.910
 subjects then I asked you questions basic values ​​to my 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.539
 questions we ask ourselves every opportunity never has the answer then 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.910
 signed I sit in my car while the pound is going to 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.250
 to remove it the pound mix with me inside have 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 been in the obligation to leave the vehicle it would be wise alone 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.890
 motivation next to you defeat Finland now which clears a 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 E-mail 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.900
 hand in hand in hand the salafists who will remain the job is to 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.510
 abide by the law in city will call police-help he will pick up the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.380
 police forces to take you out 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.630
 calmly without violence of your car but no question of you 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.249
 take you off to the pound with the car 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.159
 and there is no question that the mere fact that you can 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.149
 sitting in it obviously prevents them from helping in the nfl gave up that to me 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.399
 will not give up you will probably be entitled to the assistance of the police 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.729
 perfect second question if a small dog is inside the vehicle 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.079
 we also want to hear a lot 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.439
 so the little dog inside the vehicle a lot of people are telling each other 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.170
 children have seen a car with an animal of the order these are 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.990
 sentimental 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.119
 but the name because in fact it will happen the next thing sibaya bardot 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.600
 impounded the car will go to the animal pound will go to the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780
 impound the pound for the animals and it will be necessary to seek them 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.579
 your pet 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the aftermath they have the right to open to work on it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.660
 the reason advanced towards algeria shut down because of the software they have 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.880
 right not only because sometimes it may be necessary to save 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.359
 the dog 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.249
 where the baby was in the car because we have already seen this case 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:35.359
 decatalogs to arrive on time and then have dead simply 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.179
 but he does that he had to carry out a search of fishing nant absolutely 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.820
 not to remove the impounded vehicle 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.520
 and just in those cases it's an assumption where the police 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.580
 and gendarmes 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.920
 open the car as they have the right to do to extract it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 actually what the baby is animating the waste 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.940
 even dogs it's a guardian in the nhl these surpluses all of 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.570
 german stood béchard at the haberdashery dollars very well the master 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.610
 of orders could practice or how to be reimbursed if in the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.899
 request was not legitimate we will try it is very simple 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.849
 the kidnapping one may not be legitimate for reasons first 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:08.499
 reasons 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.699
 it's because the ticket was not I'm proud so well 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.170
 obviously an abduction no longer had any legal basis second hypothesis 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.260
 the ticket was justified for example we are not paid your 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.849
 paid parking 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.450
 but we're taking you out of the forest that it's illegal because our 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.089
 employer for all offenses only for the most serious 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.579
 so in both cases obviously you will not be addressed 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.199
 after some was shown your good right is seeing that the offense 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.849
 was not because before denouncing and I already pay the contravention 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.380
 regional excellence 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 he really experienced the kidnapping the removal of the vehicle 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.240
 requires you to recover it in the pound to pay the raise but 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.020
 it's up to you to pay the ticket 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.799
 because we must keep our chances of protest intact 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.930
 if you consider it unfounded and when you would have challenged when you will have 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.230
 won in court at that time only you will be able to 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.349
 so fast there 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.510
 the fal having to pay me back there the impoundment and what she had 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.829
 no legal basis and that will push the telegram refund of course 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.749
 we see 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.409
 an excellent report 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.439
 the surroundings of a pound a cadet then a ball inside his 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.129
 vehicle that was abused then in this case how to do how to help 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.009
 that person 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.849
 so 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.399
 the iade normally 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:19.629
 an inventory that is carried out by the contract officer the police officer or the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.039
 policeman who removes the vehicle and who would specifically know 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.909
 the condition outside the vehicle 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.029
 and he is an object apart by asking him from bottom of the French body not what 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.409

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.180
 do we have the right to park on a delivery phase at weekends? 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.499
 one needs to see it 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.160
 in the inverted you will see she is very clear 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.450
 r Delivery locations must be reserved for deliveries at all times 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.740
 day and night and any day of the week except 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.590
 Kevin I specify 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.290
 delivery locations and a location to deliver and not a 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.720
 location for players 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.039

 your rebel races but how did it signal while the ball was 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.629
 already on your vehicle on a dashboard a little paper saying 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.479

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.689
 or deliver madrid 26 years has arrived 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:09.870
 but we are struggling to achieve 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.650
 and we do not have to verbalize if the contractual is comfortable because 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.030
 that she must wait at least the time to write the situation to make sure 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.650
 the fact that the person who comes and go to unload content 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.300
 to have him does not want to see nor neither 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.340
 I think I can not see it nor can I call the tension but if I wanted 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.159
 to be verbalized it will not protect us from verbalization and we take 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.440
 a picture of the windshield where animals and humans came to these people 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.229
 who are around and vigilant if they should allow in this case 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.870
 to report the contrary evidence to us out of this situation of 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.949
 verbalization I recall on this occasion that the passengers of your 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.729
 vehicle can testify for you if they are not parents or your 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.870

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.870
 there is no answer 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.920
 a limit in time or so it is marked from such time to such time 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:57.719
 Of course 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.830

 night it is true the clothing that we rarely see the transport of funds to 4 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.179

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:14.409
 but in practice the law is hard but it is strictly applied and for 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.619
