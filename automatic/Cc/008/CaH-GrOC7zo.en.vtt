00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello c old and today I am 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.690
 would like to share with you first 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.000
 impressions of the tenth Windows 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.759
 Well tell a little about her of course in 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.130
 general let's start for a start what 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.590
 changed at all changed principle 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 quite a lot and you can download it by the way 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 now on the site of microsoft so 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.180
 if you want to download it is installed 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 extremely simple that is even easier than 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.599
 past Windows is surprising because 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.170
 so much easier 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.329
 Well let's start at the very windsurfing in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 general start menu start menu here i have 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 pleased but now something mean 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 between Windows 7 and 8 because I don’t 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.860
 I liked that crap on the whole screen which 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 filled with some cubes of diamonds i 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 I didn't even get used to it and I'm glad 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 Basically what I did because 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 removed this garbage now that's all 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 This fits in a small 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 rectangles and principle from norms about 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 Mine Kraft need to be downloaded here as well 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 Frequently used applications are very 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.400
 A useful topic is just what I include 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.880
 Basically, there is but the main course 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 the same battle is on the menu all 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 there is a guide 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.659
 and this is the entrance to my computer is clear well in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 Generally the way is interesting here everything is so 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.430
 changed that is see more all 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.320
 it became square 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 but everything became more beautiful by icons 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 well principle so in each Windows 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.240
 improved now about the browser 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.549
 microsoft edge it is here it looks like 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.890
 Internet Explorer probably because 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.400
 He always was Windows but in fact this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 not he that is, that's all on it to boot 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.229
 quickly still in it there is a function which 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 in general, just the most brilliant shorter 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.479
 see create in this note she 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 called shorter here apparently dude give 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.500
 he will make a sad rose sad 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 placard 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.270
 I liked mumin to 10 apparently 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 ask to cross out to such a person 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.579
 life in this world is forbidden that is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.210
 You can draw a browser very fun 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.790
 defiantly 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.810
 points still my God you represent ICQ 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.630
 still left in mail.ru what the hell 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.840
 Lord, have mercy 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.050
 worth the old days as they say given here 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.600
 is there even others about what a fat 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.480
 bold color listen i could draw 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.110
 all day and in this browser because 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.370
 brilliant function I will tell you so 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.830
 drag to copy area 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.560
 give from mail.ru 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:42.800
 copied so and what and cho 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.540
 okay some kind of crap well shorter fucking 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.010
 many functions can kalyak something 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.210
 can something copied in total 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.730
 wonderful browser 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.120
 but for now I'm sitting on the opera but I think that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.490
 going to this wonderful browser in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.280
 soon in general let's go 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.830
 farther already reading 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.930
 painter so now about drivers 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.250
 if you have any troubles this swing 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 nvidia experience she'll turn on you 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.710
 geforce experience i.e. she herself 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.750
 Everything will update, that is, it is looking for drivers 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.840
 the newest ones here she already has how 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.250
 times driver for windows 10 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.680
 it is him you can put 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.200
 Lana ul she in addition you can 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.900
 update the audio driver there 3d this 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.080
 video drivers in general, all that is needed so 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.330
 it will not problem with it is also about 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.940
 general performance in games like 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.870
 As all the same, that is, it does not lag but 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.720
 and no better 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.100
 because it was not yet a direct x 12 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.020
 that's when he will come out there 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.140
 performance will be there twice 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.420
 hardly fps increases like that is 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.250
 I don't remember exactly, but from the pictures there 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.459
 It is written that almost twice 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.540
 increases and this is very very much 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.180
 There are fps there from 15 to 30, so this is what 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.340
 waiting for directx 12 we believe in the best in general 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.420
 such matters also what else can be noted 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.740
 there is a built in here 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.600
 built recording guessing and somehow 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.780
 I'll show it to you. It’s kind of included in 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.520
 windows 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.340
 no at least someone write me here 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.570
 see windows.old princen 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.870
 to make 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.870
 Why do I need to do it with him ? 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.150
 I want this crap record can be included 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.430
 post here here here's a look there 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 finally shorter what to do here 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.360
 you can take a picture here 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.780
 an x-box account is made 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.850
 settings in general some kind of crap on 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.220
 in fact, but you have to deal with it and 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.470
 It seems to me that it is more profitable to swing 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.270
 programs 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.060
 Some alternatives are there 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.120
 ubees or something like that because in 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.670
 This is a long time to understand, and she probably is not 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.110
 this xbox program will pay off 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.180
 Sadila is not the same but you understand also 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.000
 after the upgrade you can save 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.770
 In general, everything is in principle in documents and games 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.780
 that is, because I even have a desktop 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.670
 I remained with only my poor 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.830
 the picture was removed 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.640
 will be put again and so everything 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.470
 saved and basically everything is on this i 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:24.290
 I think these include microsoft edge but 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.130
 In general, everything with you was to give p. 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.680
 some little syllable and shorter here p 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.840
 here from i was let's 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.540
 thanks for watching download Windows 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.540
 use microsoft edge for the tenth time
