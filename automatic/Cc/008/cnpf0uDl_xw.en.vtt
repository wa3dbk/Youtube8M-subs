00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 hello welcome from the last 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.540
 a raw energy 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.160
 I just wanted a short summary of you 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.230
 to communicate again after my five days 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.890
 Juice fasting the last five days 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.660
 Juices made with juices and 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.910
 mainly I took to myself 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 last five days a whole 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 watermelon I said it then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.610
 mostly three kilo carrots and then 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.179
 I have one in the evening 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.190
 delicious soups made with juice 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:43.899
 15 115 kilo tomatoes 1 to 1.5 kilo 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.690
 zucchini garlic baroni and sometimes 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.280
 also celery and then have it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.510
 often seasoned with cayenne 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.739
 because then I had this feeling in the evening 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.139
 I need that sharpness again 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.940
 has somehow done well 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.479
 the kid now relatively easy i had 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.699
 At no time really bad hunger 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.289
 he had but it is when you realize what 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 I really drank it 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.799
 I made sure enough carbohydrates 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.240
 to record so that I just normal 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.380
 can continue working and in mine 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.759
 handle children well 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.170
 because if you are on the map then 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.270
 you write why and is 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.899
 impatient and just tried so on 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.009
 2,000 kilocalories to come 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.180
 through the juices and that's just fine 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.880
 but I worked very fast 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.039
 Notice that as soon as I'm so light 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.930
 I got hungry from undercover 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.280
 at the kripo go spokesman explains 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.009
 then stop like a battery like that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.210
 aldi really went and you have to 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.179
 always keeps half a liter 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.159
 drink juice to stop then normal 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.969
 to work and has good too 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.560
 to be on it 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.450
 I have broken into my fast now 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 So almost after these five days is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.499
 Now have a smoothie with my breakfast 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.520
 wheatgrass bananas vanilla powder and 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.520
 water tastes very good 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:56.649
 Merck but immediately that the dare with it 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.380
 already has problems so you should completely 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.719
 then gently start eating again 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.850
 best with smoothies and very slowly 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.979
 Also drink because you notice 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.939
 not gone really tired now so because the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.460
 Now we have to turn on the body 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.780
 used food with fiber halt 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.560
 last and the staples were really 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.810
 fiber free as good as yes i have 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.270
 was expected to decrease and three 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
 kilo and 1 percent body fat loud 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.480
 our daring I do not believe you so 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.190
 really so with the weight 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.140
 but look with the body missing 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.520
 Part that is always such a thing works 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 because very different and that is just 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.360
 so a 50 euro balance that can hold it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.460
 not really one hundred percent say 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.240
 but I have three killer 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.160
 taken off now an important 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.470
 Information for me and also for you 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.020
 with me it is so that the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.300
 metabolism changed after three days 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.860
 there are five days and the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.870
 I lost weight for the first three days 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.940
 consistently and already at the beginning of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.100
 I already had these three on the third day 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.540
 kilo and the fourth and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.010
 fifth day have nothing left 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.500
 brought by weight 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
 But it has too strong detoxification 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.170
 led that I really noticed 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.970
 I'm hardly out of bed this morning 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.260
 did not come that way then you stop 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.550
 at least not so with me 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.160
 I sleep better then not 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.390
 but I detoxified 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.300
 then right, yes, I 've got everyone 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 get dressed up with water 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.230
 a mediator that is such a hose 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.940
 I 've got 9 that's pretty good of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.920
 jens schura I link the times in 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.810
 would have infobox if interested 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.490
 such a longer flexible tube like that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.080
 rubber hose you just deep 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.760
 can introduce and that has clear 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.280
 the toxins worked better 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.840
 better rinsed it quite important that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.520
 to make the enemas it really is 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.900
 often so that you can really strong 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.670
 Detoxification appearance , you get that 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.710
 not from the gut comes out drinks the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.140
 whole thing nothing yes you can too 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.070
 but somehow with bittersalt do that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.810
 is not the same 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.730
 it does not come out everything and it 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.740
 is also on the bowel and the apply 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.730
 does not go by itself yes so I would 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.200
 always recommend to make enemas 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.760
 I'll do it again 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.900
 because I've never done that in any case 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920
 because that's how I felt 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.240
 I have digestion so well 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.590
 works like a relatively often 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.630
 I grilled on the last few weeks too 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.250
 often so much schnitzel 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.720
 Eaten or even think since Hans 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.480
 and you should not do that at all 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.980
 Eat yes but I had all bock yes and 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.940
 then I realized not really 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.220
 not so special 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.180
 maybe I even have one more 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.239
 I do not have a few pictures yet 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.700
 I spotted blood and examined it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.989
 I would show you this I go 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.530
 let me know because I'm the same 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.140
 do here 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.510
 that would be the blood before me 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.050
 Juices have made since you see 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.090
 even that is clearly glued and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.150
 not really basic the body is 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.220
 then angry and yesterday I have mine 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.890
 filmed boat number and filmed 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.940
 that they are much livelier from the good 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.840
 Baskets do not hang together and that 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.580
 has already achieved a lot 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.560
 times when I make the next the 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.480
 I would really just want to 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.310
 three days make for me because it brings 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.930
 nothing to me then nothing more 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.190
 happened is my metabolism fits 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.440
 it appears to be relatively fast 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.050
 That's the case with the normal one 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.550
 fasting one says so 48 hours then 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.650
 The metabolism begins on itself 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.940
 to adjust the new level I have 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.560
 significantly less calories to me 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.940
 I do not have any 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.060
 Fiber is taken to me 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.820
 and yes no fat yes and yes 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.740
 also no proteins that mainly 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.010
 carbohydrates in the juice rings 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.280
 and keep micronutrients vitamins 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.050
 minerals and enzymes not about 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 maybe three days will do again 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.650
 eat normally for a few weeks and then 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.650
 Stop that for three days 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.480
 It's relatively easy because it's me 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.520
 I enjoy it and because it suits me 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.680
 me is such a challenge and 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.240
 I give it a very clear rule 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.370
 just buy my stuff in the morning 1 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.320
 do that and pull that through that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.660
 then easier for me than normal 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.570
 I always say it everyday 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.650
 healthier and we'd rather do that 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.370
 such a piece of the sooner 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.620
 a matter of taste 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.180
 so and now if probably now 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.950
 a few people will say yes 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.390
 is too much sugar and so I have 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.290
 I mean sober again this morning 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.169
 blood sugar measured 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.810
 Look again at norm iso 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.970
 laster energy, let's see how 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.730
 my blood sugar levels are not rare 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.160
 just got up 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.110
 looks every morning to be reminded 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.260
 is very good 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.260
 we'll see 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.889
 84 a very good value 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.219
 and that after five days mainly 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:52.639
 drinking fruit juices and vegetable shipyard 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:56.099
 I have been lying for five days mainly 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.529
 So 2000 kilocalories only from 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.599
 Carbohydrates from freshly pressed 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.460
 Juices increased when I am now 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.680
 somehow diabetes or blood sugar 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.199
 this would have run apart 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.719
 value looks different so believe is 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.789
 a very very good value so many thanks 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.289
 to watch yes, you can go well 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:17.930
 If you like, try it almost as well 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:20.520
 Again , I think the best form 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.110
 a detox or a talk 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.339
 Proceed so to say and I would 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.529
 keep on doing it makes me too 

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:27.779
 fun and i'm fine too i am now 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:29.520
 totally tired because I think last too 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.080
 eight it is not right now 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.009
 Going with the detox if you 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.479
 say you do something like 30 days then 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.969
 Do not invite big projects 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:40.759
 So what's really ripping out? 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:42.960
 from the normal life 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.360
 you should do that in the phase where 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.740
 So you did not stress too much 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.629
 It's good I hope it helped you 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.399
 soon there are a thumbs 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.399
 top and deep
