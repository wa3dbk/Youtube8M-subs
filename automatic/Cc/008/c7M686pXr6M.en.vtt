which<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> saw<00:02:05.670> yesterday<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.650> are

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
which we just saw yesterday but they are

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
which we just saw yesterday but they are
most<00:02:08.100> definitely<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.670> largest<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.330> most

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
robust you'll notice they're a bit

robust you'll notice they're a bit
rounder<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.210> they<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:13.050> feathers<00:02:13.800> which<00:02:14.160> we

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
rounder and they have feathers which we

also down their bills as well to keep

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.450

them warm in these harsh conditions they
are<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.030> most<00:02:21.270> resilient<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.290> animals<00:02:22.680> they

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
are the most resilient of animals they

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
harshest conditions in the winter and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.760 
harshest conditions in the winter and
what's<00:02:29.370> most<00:02:30.210> important<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:31.020> us<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.500> we

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
what's most important for us is that we

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.190 
what's most important for us is that we
really<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:33.030> them<00:02:33.240> there<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.900> places

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
really get to see them there in places

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.820 
really get to see them there in places
generally<00:02:34.890> where<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.850> ships<00:02:36.120> can't<00:02:36.450> reach

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
generally where the ships can't reach

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.500 
generally where the ships can't reach
only<00:02:37.830> ice<00:02:38.220> breakers<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:38.910> helicopters

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
only ice breakers or helicopters

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.500 
only ice breakers or helicopters
generally<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.140> reach<00:02:40.350> an<00:02:40.740> emperor<00:02:41.220> colony<00:02:41.700> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
generally can reach an emperor colony so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.600 
generally can reach an emperor colony so
today<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.890> incredible
