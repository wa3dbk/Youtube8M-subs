 protracted spring so wet so 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.880

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.340
 who didn't plant onion garlic before winter 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.940
 very long tormented and landing was 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.920
 produced at the end of May and it is very 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.200
 late onions and garlic are so tricky 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.050
 cultures that form a head only 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.719

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.429
 managed to throw away 9 feathers and did not have time 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.800
 form a head then you stay 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.699
 without these beautiful vegetables that are on 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.589
