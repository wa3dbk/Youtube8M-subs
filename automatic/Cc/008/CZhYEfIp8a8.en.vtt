00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
improved the screen quality once again

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.760 
improved the screen quality once again

just<00:06:12.490> as<00:06:12.699> good<00:06:13.139> I<00:06:14.139> find<00:06:15.009> actually<00:06:15.610> they're

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
just as good I find actually they're

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.719 
just as good I find actually they're
both<00:06:16.060> very<00:06:16.660> very<00:06:16.900> good<00:06:17.490> versions<00:06:18.490> of<00:06:18.639> the

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
both very very good versions of the

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.520 
both very very good versions of the
Kindle<00:06:19.060> so<00:06:19.630> it<00:06:19.720> all<00:06:19.840> depends<00:06:20.199> if<00:06:20.259> you<00:06:20.319> want<00:06:20.349> to

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530
