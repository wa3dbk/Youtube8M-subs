00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.540
 we are still on board the new one 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.290
 let's see the system 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.240
 infotainment 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.010
 we have already seen the one on ford 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.300
 focus here too there is never sync then 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.860
 everything works more or less in the same 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
 way 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.429
 let's start with the navigation system 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.220
 it is nothing but a garmin that connects 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.079
 directly to the car works like 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.210
 all the garmins so perfectly 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.630
 without any problems he finds the streets 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.730
 faster without great difficulty than 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.350
 instead setting the whole system 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.620
 infotainment of the car passes 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.930
 through the central display in the center 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.270
 of the 5-inch dashboard 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.730
 maybe a little too little respect 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.050
 to what we would have expected with a 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.060
 couple of extra inches we would have had 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.100
 all another idea then we have 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.440
 first of all the possibility of interacting 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.110
 with infotainment sections through i 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.700
 controls arranged on the central unit but 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.040
 we also have some possibilities 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.720
 is given by the steering wheel with respect to the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.510
 ford focus we lose some buttons 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.460
 but here we have everything concentrated 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.380
 close to the breeds of the note of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.240
 steering wheel and it's all very simple to 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.970
 use to be we have the setting 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.710
 of cruise control and left instead 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.690
 we have the possibility to raise 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.980
 lower the volume access the controls 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.990
 vowels that work very well 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.120
 unfortunately this car is in English 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.820
 so we will not try them if not at the end 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.040
 it's back and forth as a trace over 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 than to put down and start a new one 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.480
 telephone conversation the cd said the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 cd obviously also reads 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.010
 the mp3s however the most interesting thing to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.980
 use and here is the usb port that there 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.680
 allows you to connect either a smartphone or 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.330
 a simple key and the exit o 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.070
 hicks the weeks we do not approve of why 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.540
 simply connect a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 any device that then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.290
 use through is the device 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 same 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 instead we try to install one 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.430
 usb stick and see what happens 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.660
 here on the display 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.610
 let's click here a weeks and go 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.230
 already recognizing the same stylus that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.119
 we had previously entered 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.390
 let's try turning up the volume to make you 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.390
 feel like pump the hi fi system 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.000
 here you have seen the message of the limit 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.910
 of the volume achieved this because 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 because it was inserted on this 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.790
 car 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.830
 the system that never allows us to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.500
 intervene on certain aspects of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.360
 car just to give it to the less i 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.370
 less experienced drivers or our children 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.739
 or things like that we can 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.880
 intervene on the volume of the aif of the aifa 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.550
 and on the maximum speed and on the per 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.380
 example on the petrol indicator 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.390
 for the reserve for which we cannot 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.220
 go very high but we were already a 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.950
 good volume level here we can 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 see through the four commands here 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.110
 below which reproduce those you have 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.239
 seen a second ago inside the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.549
 playlist and artists' songs 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.650
 present on the stick of course 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.930
 we reach the maximum if we go to 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.720
 connect any smartphone to us 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.989
 here we have an iphone 5 we go 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.959
 immediately to connect we can use it 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:24.630
 as well as to listen to music from vs 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.070
 b simply from the from the bluetooth the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.400
 being able to use bluetooth 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.160
 obviously forces us to use 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.069
 just back and forth of the tracks 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.019
 while instead if we use the mode 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.549
 usb we can navigate in all that 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.790
 that the ipod or the iphone or yours 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.400
 smartphones have at the level of 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.670
 of playlists of artists etcetera 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.680
 the phone also works very well 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.719
 really panning with Bluetooth 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.659
 question of moments now let's try 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:04:03.260
 use the voice call and see 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:03.260
 a little if andrea galeazzi 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.880
 as you see is calling andrea let's see 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.650
 a bit if unfortunately he answers us 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.449
 English therefore also came to galaxy 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.419
 a bit like the samsung galaxy 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.139
 now let's see if he answers us 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.220
 busy elsewhere andrea ciao hi 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.070
 we are trying 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:38.610
 we are testing the system on video 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.919
 bluetooth tell me how I feel perfect 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
 so also your bluetooth system 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.580
 it works well i feel the same 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.130
 well we are firm so we don't have 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.750
 no problem you see part of yours 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.460
 phone number that is known, however 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.020
 now all over the world so there is not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.680
 any normal ones so that 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.870
 we'll darken probably fine 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.470
 here is good then I salute you stammibene 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.470
 good return 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.409
 here you have seen how well he felt me 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.150
 basses are of course what they are 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.289
 however, in short, nothing is left to chance 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.729
 on this car which is only a little 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.860
 difficult to use infotainment level 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.599
 at the beginning but when you entered 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.580
 tuning with the inc incident corn of 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.210
 bad word game you won't have any 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.370
 problem 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.479
 h Friends of the engines mean we 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.479
 see you at the next test
