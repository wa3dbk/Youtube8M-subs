 the red ice wins the extra time 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.370
 the extension that gives nothing the red 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.870

 must also a proud candle to his 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.230
 gatekeeper gauthier nails 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.210
 twelve days after the victory against 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 the red light finds the forum 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.830
 with the visit of hc ajoie 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.030
 a match that starts very hard 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.800
 for red and white visibly 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.110
 still tired of the efforts made 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.160
 during the derby in the 13th minute in 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.900
 numerical superiority 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.470
 ajoie can open the mark and thanks to 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.470
 thomas beauregard 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.890
 an evil led the raid 1 essay reacts 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 yet immediately after this first 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.010
 goal the top scorecard reworked cnops girl 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.010
 who can equalize at the 16th 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.879
 in the second third the red ice 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.769
 will completely miss out on his subject 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.330
 archi dominated by the Jura 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.330
 are going to hold albert malkin players 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.069
 but the 35th ruddy Mike can score 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.069
 the 2 to 1 in favor of the Jura 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.010
 led 2-1 the red ice enjoys a 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.290
 long superiority over numeral 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 one minute twenty to 53 they will be 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.680
 however unable to worry the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.909
 Jura porter is worse at three 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.709
 seconds of the second siren 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.959
 mike ruddy again helped by 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.090
 latte scores 3 1 in favor of 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.709
 Jura people the red ice seems gone for 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.690
 a first home defeat but the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.640
 salutary reaction will occur in the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.470
 third third arts and dice transform 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.269
 transformed by the desire to win the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.120
 Will not to lose at home to 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.769
 the image of mike knoepfli at the 47th to the good 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.690
 moment in front of the goal that can deflect the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.690
 washer the nice ray returns to 3 to 2 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.180
 alas he continues to push forward the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.500
 53rd served by enlightened vic host is well 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.299
 here nothing goes around the cage 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.400
 Jura e mails not at the bottom the red 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.650
 ice equates to 3 everywhere the forum explodes 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.359
 finally back to 3-3 the red ice does not want 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.979
 not go into overtime like thursday 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.280
 face to viège and continue its march in 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.930
 before 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.780
 they are rewarded the red and white 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.700
 by arnaud montandon in the 58th minute 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.800
 the red ice takes the advantage for the 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.430
 first time of the evening is 4 to 3 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.430
 for red and white 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.640
 the final score is ugly in the cage 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.960
 empty in a forum in jesse jérémy vick 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.450
 in the last minute that does not mix 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.700
 that in the background superb victory 5 goals to 3 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.520
 after being led to score 3 1 after 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.650
 40 minutes 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.780
 ike incredible ap game of led red ice 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.730
 3 after two thirds he wins 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.200
 finally 5 to 3 the coach says in 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.760
 the locker room is the will at the end 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.250
 each time the difference and that's it 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.160

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.110
 minutes we never thought the match 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.150
 is finished and I think we showed a 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590
 player and then the other teams we go 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.990
