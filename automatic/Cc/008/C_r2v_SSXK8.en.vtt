first<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.040> need<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> go<00:00:08.400> over<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.730> few<00:00:08.820> things

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
first I need to go over a few things

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.169 
first I need to go over a few things
even<00:00:10.860> though<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.130> plane<00:00:11.429> will<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.700> loosely

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
even though this plane will be loosely

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.690 
even though this plane will be loosely
based<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> shape<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> X<00:00:13.559> 45<00:00:14.130> scene<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
based on the shape of the X 45 scene I

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
based on the shape of the X 45 scene I
plan<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.330> making<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.350> only<00:00:16.500> design<00:00:16.920> as

video<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.619> am<00:01:52.009> building<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.640> second<00:01:53.119> plane<00:01:53.539> numb

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
video I am building a second plane numb

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.310 
video I am building a second plane numb
this<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.100> actually<00:01:55.549> drawn<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.420> 30<00:01:56.810> millimeter

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
this is actually drawn on 30 millimeter

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.980 
this is actually drawn on 30 millimeter
EPP<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.329> be<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.720> plane

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
EPP this is going to be the plane

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.160 
EPP this is going to be the plane
without<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.920> KF<00:02:01.250> airfoil<00:02:01.869> we're<00:02:02.869> gonna<00:02:02.960> go

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
without the KF airfoil we're gonna go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.410 
without the KF airfoil we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.380> use<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.920> plane<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
ahead and use this plane to get the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.130 
ahead and use this plane to get the
dimensions<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.080> draw<00:02:06.319> on<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.649> 15<00:02:07.130> millimeter

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
dimensions to draw on the 15 millimeter

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.110 
dimensions to draw on the 15 millimeter
EPP<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.679> we<00:02:09.799> can<00:02:09.950> build<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.250> plane<00:02:10.519> with<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
EPP so we can build the plane with the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.660 
EPP so we can build the plane with the
KF<00:02:11.630> airfoil<00:02:13.569> okay<00:02:14.569> if<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.410> notice<00:02:15.830> there<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
KF airfoil okay if you notice there is a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.300 
KF airfoil okay if you notice there is a
line<00:02:17.060> drawn<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.319> center<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:19.069> the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
line drawn right down the center of the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.809 
line drawn right down the center of the
wing<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.319> our<00:02:21.349> most<00:02:22.160> important

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
wing this is gonna be our most important

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.780 
wing this is gonna be our most important
part<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.959> building<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.560> plane<00:02:24.890> because

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
part in building this plane because

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.759 
part in building this plane because
everything<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.450> gonna<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.660> based<00:02:27.049> off<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.380> this

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
everything is gonna be based off of this

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.160 
everything is gonna be based off of this
centre<00:02:28.190> line<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:29.360> order<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.660> make<00:02:29.840> sure<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
wing is square and straight it's very

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.720 
wing is square and straight it's very
important<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.680> everything<00:02:34.099> is<00:02:34.340> measured

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
important that everything is measured

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.949

off<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.329> line<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.090> we're<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.630> go<00:02:38.840> ahead

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
off of this line so we're gonna go ahead

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.460 
off of this line so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:39.260> turn<00:02:39.799> off<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.100> camera<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:41.079> I'm<00:02:42.079> gonna<00:02:42.230> go

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
and turn off the camera and I'm gonna go

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.330 
and turn off the camera and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.040> draw<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.880> center<00:02:44.239> line<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.950> 15

on<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> phone<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.819> want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.209> sure<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
on the phone you want to make sure and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.890 
on the phone you want to make sure and
find<00:02:56.720> which<00:02:57.500> side<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.160> small<00:02:58.640> square<00:02:59.120> so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
find which side is the small square so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.349 
find which side is the small square so
check<00:03:00.380> all<00:03:00.859> four<00:03:01.220> corners<00:03:01.549> with<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> square

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
check all four corners with the square

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.460 
check all four corners with the square
and<00:03:03.519> just<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.639> see<00:03:04.819> which<00:03:05.329> side<00:03:05.569> came<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:06.019> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
and just to see which side came out the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.840 
and just to see which side came out the
most<00:03:06.620> square<00:03:06.950> because<00:03:07.160> most<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.459> time<00:03:07.639> these

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
most square because most of time these

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.030 
most square because most of time these
foam<00:03:08.090> sheets<00:03:08.359> don't<00:03:08.630> come<00:03:08.840> out<00:03:08.930> perfect<00:03:09.500> on

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
foam sheets don't come out perfect on

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.069 
foam sheets don't come out perfect on
this<00:03:10.250> piece<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.639> phone<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.090> side<00:03:11.389> have

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
this piece of phone to this side have

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.720 
this piece of phone to this side have
the<00:03:12.109> straightest<00:03:12.680> edge<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> most<00:03:13.340> square

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the straightest edge and the most square

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.110 
the straightest edge and the most square
so<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.840> side<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.290> decided<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
so this is the side that I decided the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.390 
so this is the side that I decided the
market<00:03:17.120> from<00:03:17.560> once<00:03:18.560> you've<00:03:18.680> decided<00:03:19.069> which

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
market from once you've decided which

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.559 
market from once you've decided which
side<00:03:19.670> looks<00:03:20.269> more<00:03:20.540> square<00:03:21.049> go<00:03:21.889> ahead<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.569> find

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
side looks more square go ahead and find

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.760 
side looks more square go ahead and find
out

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
out

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.550 
out
total<00:03:25.070> width<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> phone<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:30.290> sheet

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
total width of the phone is this sheet

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000 
total width of the phone is this sheet
is<00:03:30.710> actually<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> little<00:03:31.550> bit<00:03:31.670> over<00:03:32.650> 36<00:03:33.650> inches

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
is actually a little bit over 36 inches

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.720 
is actually a little bit over 36 inches
it's<00:03:34.190> 36<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.060> quarter<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.190> what<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.340> do<00:03:37.520> is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
it's 36 and a quarter so what you do is

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.800 
it's 36 and a quarter so what you do is
you<00:03:37.850> want<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.150> go<00:03:38.270> ahead<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:40.630> mark<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
you want to go ahead and mark the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.400 
you want to go ahead and mark the
halfway<00:03:41.960> point<00:03:44.380> which<00:03:45.380> would<00:03:45.470> be<00:03:45.620> 18<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.130> 1/8

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
halfway point which would be 18 and 1/8

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.280 
halfway point which would be 18 and 1/8
so<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.470> mark<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.920> with<00:03:49.070> your<00:03:49.280> Penry<00:03:50.030> or<00:03:50.290> fine

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
so you mark it with your Penry or fine

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.010 
so you mark it with your Penry or fine
tip<00:03:51.590> marker<00:03:54.520> then<00:03:55.520> take<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.540> square<00:03:58.870> lay<00:03:59.870> it

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
tip marker then take the square lay it

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.920 
tip marker then take the square lay it
on<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.320> mark<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:03.850> go<00:04:04.850> ahead<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.630> draw<00:04:05.900> your

on the mark and go ahead and draw your

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.740 
on the mark and go ahead and draw your
line<00:04:06.290> for<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:06.950> center<00:04:07.250> line<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:08.120> don't<00:04:08.600> want

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
line for the center line you don't want

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.840 
line for the center line you don't want
to<00:04:08.840> just<00:04:08.990> measure<00:04:09.320> off<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.830> corners<00:04:10.310> from<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
to just measure off the corners from the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.250 
to just measure off the corners from the
top<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.300> bottom<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.840> then<00:04:11.960> draw<00:04:12.200> the
