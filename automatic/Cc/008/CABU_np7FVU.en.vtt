00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.939 

there's<00:00:02.900> a<00:00:02.960> lot<00:00:03.080> of<00:00:03.110> new<00:00:03.290> features<00:00:03.500> in

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:03.949 
there's a lot of new features in

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.789 
there's a lot of new features in
photobooth<00:00:04.430> connected<00:00:04.939> 2.0<00:00:05.589> but<00:00:06.589> the<00:00:06.650> most

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
photobooth connected 2.0 but the most

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.129 
photobooth connected 2.0 but the most
exciting<00:00:07.160> one<00:00:07.460> I<00:00:07.520> think<00:00:07.879> is<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.510> addition<00:00:09.049> of

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
exciting one I think is the addition of

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.529 
exciting one I think is the addition of
the<00:00:09.260> booth<00:00:09.469> mode<00:00:09.740> which<00:00:10.580> essentially<00:00:11.299> allows

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:11.539 
the booth mode which essentially allows

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.070 
the booth mode which essentially allows
it<00:00:11.840> to<00:00:11.930> work<00:00:12.230> as<00:00:12.559> a<00:00:12.709> plugin<00:00:13.070> for<00:00:13.639> breeze<00:00:14.080> and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
it to work as a plugin for breeze and

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.190 
it to work as a plugin for breeze and
social<00:00:15.680> media<00:00:15.799> uploads<00:00:16.309> right<00:00:16.609> at<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> booth

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
social media uploads right at the booth

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.840 
social media uploads right at the booth
so<00:00:18.200> before<00:00:18.590> photo<00:00:19.190> booth<00:00:19.370> connected<00:00:19.760> you

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
so before photo booth connected you

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.820 
so before photo booth connected you
stole<00:00:20.060> my<00:00:20.150> work<00:00:20.300> in<00:00:20.480> kiosk<00:00:20.840> mode<00:00:21.080> which<00:00:21.560> was

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
stole my work in kiosk mode which was

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.630 
stole my work in kiosk mode which was
was<00:00:22.460> good<00:00:22.970> for<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.600> social<00:00:24.170> upload<00:00:24.860> kiosk<00:00:25.310> away

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
was good for a social upload kiosk away

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.550 
was good for a social upload kiosk away
from<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.970> booth<00:00:26.120> but<00:00:26.840> now<00:00:26.990> if<00:00:27.110> we<00:00:27.230> said<00:00:27.410> at<00:00:27.530> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
from the booth but now if we said at the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.340 
from the booth but now if we said at the
booth<00:00:27.800> mode<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.940> install<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.780> run<00:00:29.900> it<00:00:30.080> on<00:00:30.230> the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
booth mode you install and run it on the

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.550 
booth mode you install and run it on the
same<00:00:30.590> machine<00:00:30.800> as<00:00:31.400> breeze<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:32.170> soon<00:00:33.170> as<00:00:33.320> you

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
same machine as breeze and soon as you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.990 
same machine as breeze and soon as you
start<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.100> up<00:00:34.190> it's<00:00:34.579> going<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.820> minimize

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
start it up it's going to minimize

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.750 
start it up it's going to minimize
itself<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.500> it's<00:00:36.650> going<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.950> monitor

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
itself and then it's going to monitor

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.030 
itself and then it's going to monitor
breezes<00:00:38.180> output<00:00:38.600> folder<00:00:38.810> for<00:00:39.050> new<00:00:39.350> photos<00:00:39.770> and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
breezes output folder for new photos and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.810 
breezes output folder for new photos and
then<00:00:40.579> it'll<00:00:40.970> take<00:00:41.390> over<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.820> seamlessly

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
then it'll take over and seamlessly

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.790 
then it'll take over and seamlessly
integrate<00:00:44.270> with<00:00:44.420> Bri<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:44.989> allow<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.680> have

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
integrate with Bri so allow you to have

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.510 
integrate with Bri so allow you to have
social<00:00:46.040> media<00:00:46.460> uploading<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:51.250> there<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.370> go

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
social media uploading so there we go

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.639 
social media uploading so there we go
you<00:00:52.579> can<00:00:52.730> see<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.180> just<00:00:53.210> minimized<00:00:53.809> itself<00:00:54.230> and

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
you can see it just minimized itself and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.930 
you can see it just minimized itself and
now<00:00:54.860> let's<00:00:55.160> start<00:00:55.430> up<00:00:55.550> breeze<00:00:57.520> now<00:00:58.520> I've<00:00:58.700> made

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
now let's start up breeze now I've made

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.240 
now let's start up breeze now I've made
my<00:00:59.079> backgrounds<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.170> breeze<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.680> same<00:01:00.920> as<00:01:01.100> my

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
my backgrounds and breeze the same as my

my backgrounds and breeze the same as my
background<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.000> photobooth<00:01:02.390> connected<00:01:02.899> so

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
background and photobooth connected so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.559 
background and photobooth connected so
in<00:01:03.320> photobooth<00:01:03.680> Kinect<00:01:04.040> takes<00:01:04.369> over<00:01:04.729> it'll<00:01:05.479> be

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:05.569 
in photobooth Kinect takes over it'll be

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.649 
in photobooth Kinect takes over it'll be
