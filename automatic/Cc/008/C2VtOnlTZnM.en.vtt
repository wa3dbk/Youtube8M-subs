I<00:04:05.340> had<00:04:05.519> before<00:04:05.790> we're<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.120> sort<00:04:06.299> of<00:04:06.410> dorky

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
I had before we're just sort of dorky

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.069 
I had before we're just sort of dorky
you<00:04:07.620> live<00:04:07.859> in<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.250> mid<00:04:08.519> 90s<00:04:09.329> kind<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.840> frames

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
you live in the mid 90s kind of frames

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.240 
you live in the mid 90s kind of frames
so<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:11.269> don't<00:04:12.269> know<00:04:12.329> whatever<00:04:13.019> anyway<00:04:13.949> so

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so I don't know whatever anyway so

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.890 
so I don't know whatever anyway so
that's<00:04:14.459> one<00:04:14.669> of<00:04:14.699> them<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:14.970> then<00:04:15.299> hold<00:04:15.569> on

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900 

another<00:04:23.900> cat<00:04:24.470> iframe<00:04:24.949> again<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.669> too

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
another cat iframe again it's not too

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850 
another cat iframe again it's not too
wide<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.150> other<00:04:26.479> ones<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.900> have<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.800> are

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
wide the other ones that I have that are

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.820 
wide the other ones that I have that are
the<00:04:28.130> cat<00:04:28.340> eyes<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.729> purple<00:04:29.090> ones<00:04:29.270> there<00:04:30.110> uh<00:04:30.139> I

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
the cat eyes the purple ones there uh I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.159 
the cat eyes the purple ones there uh I
think<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.340> want<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.580> say<00:04:31.639> 51<00:04:32.090> millimeter<00:04:32.720> lenses

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
think I want to say 51 millimeter lenses

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.850 
think I want to say 51 millimeter lenses
which<00:04:33.979> is<00:04:34.639> kind<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.030> my<00:04:35.180> cutoff<00:04:35.509> if<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.110> go<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.319> 52

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
which is kind of my cutoff if I go to 52

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.839 
which is kind of my cutoff if I go to 52
it<00:04:37.039> just<00:04:37.190> looks<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.370> I'm<00:04:37.550> wearing<00:04:37.759> these

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
it just looks like I'm wearing these

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.999 
it just looks like I'm wearing these
giant<00:04:38.270> goggles<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:38.840> my<00:04:38.960> head<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:39.740> these

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
giant goggles on my head I think these

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.680 
giant goggles on my head I think these
are<00:04:40.069> only<00:04:40.550> 48<00:04:41.120> or<00:04:41.599> 49<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.060> was<00:04:44.300> actually

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
are only 48 or 49 so I was actually

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
are only 48 or 49 so I was actually
worried<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:44.960> they<00:04:45.080> might<00:04:45.199> be<00:04:45.349> too<00:04:45.500> narrow

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
worried that they might be too narrow

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.339 
worried that they might be too narrow
but<00:04:46.300> there<00:04:47.300> are<00:04:47.419> pretty<00:04:47.630> good<00:04:47.840> width

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
but there are pretty good width

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.140 
but there are pretty good width
they're<00:04:48.560> not<00:04:48.710> too<00:04:48.889> wide<00:04:49.069> for<00:04:49.310> my<00:04:49.400> face<00:04:49.610> they're

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
they're not too wide for my face they're

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.320 
they're not too wide for my face they're
not<00:04:50.270> too<00:04:50.419> long<00:04:50.630> either<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.500> do<00:04:52.069> think<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
not too long either I do think the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.390 
not too long either I do think the
longer<00:04:53.840> frames<00:04:54.289> tend<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> make<00:04:54.740> my<00:04:54.860> nose<00:04:54.919> which

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
longer frames tend to make my nose which

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.390 
longer frames tend to make my nose which
is<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.849> have<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.419> very<00:04:56.449> small<00:04:56.780> nose<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:58.220> they

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
is I have a very small nose but they

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.879 
is I have a very small nose but they
make<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.729> look<00:04:58.910> being<00:04:59.240> somehow<00:04:59.770> I<00:05:02.800> don't<00:05:03.800> know

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
make it look being somehow I don't know

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.499 
make it look being somehow I don't know
maybe<00:05:04.370> it's<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.610> something<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.060> noticed

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
maybe it's just something that I noticed

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.320 
maybe it's just something that I noticed
that<00:05:05.630> other<00:05:05.720> people<00:05:06.050> don't<00:05:06.229> notice<00:05:06.380> and

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
that other people don't notice and

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.060 
that other people don't notice and
that's<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.570> they<00:05:09.169> are<00:05:09.320> brown<00:05:09.590> on<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.830> front

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
that's it they are brown on the front

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.620 
that's it they are brown on the front
there<00:05:10.430> right<00:05:10.639> on<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.789> side<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.090> don't<00:05:11.270> know<00:05:11.479> why

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
there right on the side I don't know why

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.450 
there right on the side I don't know why
why<00:05:11.930> would<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.229> do<00:05:12.380> that<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.830> confused<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
why would you do that it confused the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.370 
why would you do that it confused the
crap<00:05:14.000> out<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.330> me<00:05:14.690> when<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.840> opened<00:05:15.229> up<00:05:15.259> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
crap out of me when I opened up the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.589 
crap out of me when I opened up the
package<00:05:15.530> that's<00:05:15.919> like<00:05:16.039> they're<00:05:16.250> red<00:05:16.599> they

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
package that's like they're red they

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.570 
package that's like they're red they
said<00:05:17.780> they<00:05:17.870> were<00:05:17.960> brown<00:05:18.199> and<00:05:18.830> then<00:05:18.979> finally<00:05:19.520> I

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
said they were brown and then finally I

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.939 
said they were brown and then finally I
saw<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.150> front<00:05:20.479> part<00:05:20.659> and<00:05:20.720> was<00:05:20.900> like<00:05:20.990> oh<00:05:21.229> no

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
saw the front part and was like oh no

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.260 
saw the front part and was like oh no
they<00:05:22.099> are<00:05:22.250> brown<00:05:22.520> they're<00:05:22.759> just<00:05:22.909> red<00:05:23.060> on<00:05:23.180> the

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
they are brown they're just red on the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.749 
they are brown they're just red on the
side<00:05:23.479> why<00:05:23.949> why<00:05:24.949> wouldn't<00:05:25.250> you<00:05:25.310> just<00:05:25.340> make<00:05:25.610> them

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
side why why wouldn't you just make them

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.310 
side why why wouldn't you just make them
one<00:05:25.880> color<00:05:26.120> or<00:05:26.240> make<00:05:26.690> them<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:27.020> kind<00:05:27.259> of

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
one color or make them to kind of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.320 
one color or make them to kind of
complementary<00:05:28.280> colors<00:05:28.729> instead<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.090> making

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
complementary colors instead of making

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.600 
complementary colors instead of making
them<00:05:29.449> two<00:05:29.630> very<00:05:29.870> similar<00:05:30.229> colors<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.460> just

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
them two very similar colors that just

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.529 
them two very similar colors that just
doesn't<00:05:31.759> make<00:05:31.940> any<00:05:32.000> sense

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
doesn't make any sense

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.540 
doesn't make any sense
but<00:05:32.659> whatever<00:05:32.810> I'm<00:05:33.080> not<00:05:33.110> complaining<00:05:33.650> 50

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
but whatever I'm not complaining 50

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.540 
but whatever I'm not complaining 50
bucks<00:05:34.759> I<00:05:35.120> think<00:05:35.360> about<00:05:36.050> maybe<00:05:36.349> 45<00:05:36.889> for<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.400> two

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
bucks I think about maybe 45 for the two

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.730 
bucks I think about maybe 45 for the two
pairs<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.240> was<00:05:38.360> buy<00:05:38.509> one<00:05:38.750> get<00:05:38.900> one<00:05:38.960> half<00:05:39.050> off<00:05:39.380> so

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
pairs it was buy one get one half off so

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.550 
pairs it was buy one get one half off so
that<00:05:39.979> was<00:05:40.729> good<00:05:40.909> I<00:05:41.150> got<00:05:41.479> just<00:05:42.229> regular

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
that was good I got just regular

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.379 
that was good I got just regular
anti-reflective<00:05:43.130> coating<00:05:43.550> on<00:05:43.639> this<00:05:43.789> one<00:05:43.940> the

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
anti-reflective coating on this one the

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.990 
anti-reflective coating on this one the
other<00:05:44.539> one<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.780> have<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:45.289> sort<00:05:46.159> of<00:05:46.310> what<00:05:46.789> it's<00:05:46.909> a

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
other one I have the sort of what it's a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.260 
other one I have the sort of what it's a
hydrophobic<00:05:50.259> smudgy<00:05:51.259> resistant<00:05:52.120> coating<00:05:53.120> on

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
hydrophobic smudgy resistant coating on

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.390 
hydrophobic smudgy resistant coating on
that<00:05:53.449> when<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.659> paid<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:53.960> little<00:05:54.169> more<00:05:54.560> this<00:05:55.099> kind

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
that when I paid a little more this kind

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.709 
that when I paid a little more this kind
of<00:05:55.490> see<00:05:55.900> how<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:57.080> was<00:05:57.759> and<00:05:58.759> I<00:05:58.940> didn't<00:05:59.240> get<00:05:59.449> any

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
of see how it was and I didn't get any

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.659 
of see how it was and I didn't get any

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
why it takes two weeks and the coastal

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.899 
why it takes two weeks and the coastal
ones<00:06:29.539> took<00:06:29.810> like<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:29.990> day<00:06:30.409> I<00:06:30.710> mean<00:06:31.339> literally<00:06:31.610> it
