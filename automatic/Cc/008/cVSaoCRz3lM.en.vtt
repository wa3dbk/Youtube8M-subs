 video for you this time unfortunately 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
 It took a bit longer for you to get the fabric 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.600
 but I hope you have fun 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.119
 paraphernalia 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.099
 Of course you need growth for that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.410
 There are once as a meter to buy 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.309
 stuck resorted 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 then you also need one pin 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.559
 tailor schira a tape measure or a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.570
 ruler and a pen we set off first 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149

 Rectangles are 80 cm x 70 cm on 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.020
 the front part of the utensils draws 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 you on the left fabric side the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.910
 then the whole thing will turn out 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.100
 on another oilcloth also on the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.439
 left fabric side recorded and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 of course everything cut out for that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.470
 of course, you only need intensive ones 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 sleep to hang 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.119
 I have four on the main and four 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.710
 loops sewn as these are double 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 please be careful 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.900
 rectangles measuring five centimeters 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 times 14 inches and marks you the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
 Umbruch line is at seven 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 centimeters so in the middle then have the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.250
 First of all, share the four together 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 each loop twice the back part 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 the front part and pockets 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.880
 We win with them first 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.090
 The upper edges of the bag are lined 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 If you are on the borders since shiny 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.259
 The growth side is not these 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.399
 fire please otherwise the fabric will 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.590
 a machine is not right 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.820
 transported or her almost the edges 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 with a helical ribbon a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.439
 then we come to the loops here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.509
 in each case two parts are right on 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.670
 stuck on the right and the long sides 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.280
 Then the whole thing is sewn 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 we sent it to the right 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.509
 the bags on the front here 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 cream animal the smooth side of 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.550
 growth again, or if ye 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.959
 the dead animal so to speak, that is blind 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.629
 the bags are put on the right and 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.910
 Sewn from the left, you also have to 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.860
 still 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.230
 Kreher lines for bags insert modules 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.540
 vote if you are so far since 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.880
 the loops as seen in the picture 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.380
 is stuck on the front part of the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.810
 back side then comes to the right 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.300
 on the right everything is sewn up 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.280
 The walls open the alley in the series and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.960
 turn and close the mouth and 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760
 the thing is done already 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.680
 I opened my room because 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.130
 Growth is natural 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.530
 washable and not so sensitive 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.240
 due to the high humidity and after 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.400
 I show you a little break then 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.400
 another project made of oilcloth 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.220
 and on it goes for the bags 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.560
 Wardrobe made of oilcloth he needed in 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.980
 Germany or a ruler a pen 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.750
 the tailor's scissors pins and it 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.000
 and of course the growth 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.870
 I've walked in the first eight 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.510
 strip with 5 cm wide excellent 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.280
 my blanket was unfortunately only 80 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.130
 For a long time the team I need a few 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.250
 more stripes for the right one 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.170
 length to get then in the second 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.850
 Two strips each are taken 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 right on the right and on one 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.240
 short side sewn together goes on 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.570
 it then that two stripes on it 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.050
 be plugged together and sewn 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.330
 become 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.970
 but this is not the opening 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.650
 Forgot to dare the seam 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.120
 then I have access to the strip 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.510
 a sheer cut back 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.670
 and then would be the hook it hung and 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.430
 The bags can be sorted well 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.930
 the stripes are housed 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.140
 not necessarily fancy but very 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.510
 practically so and that was already it 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.370
 second shorter project i hope mine 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.350
 video has pleased you again and me 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.060
 wish you much fun to see 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.060
 and hopefully see you soon
