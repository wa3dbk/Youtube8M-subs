in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.780> session<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.800> study

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
in this session we're going to study

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.430 
in this session we're going to study

energy pyramids energy pyramids are an
important<00:00:04.830> concept<00:00:05.250> in<00:00:05.490> ecology<00:00:06.060> because<00:00:06.569> as

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
important concept in ecology because as

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.690 
important concept in ecology because as

test that you take on ecology you're
going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.110> least<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.650> if<00:00:13.920> not<00:00:14.130> more

going to have at least one if not more

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
going to have at least one if not more
questions<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:15.120> an<00:00:15.240> energy<00:00:15.570> pyramid<00:00:15.809> so

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
questions about an energy pyramid so

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.400 
questions about an energy pyramid so
let's<00:00:16.770> start<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.160> taking<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.730> look<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.410> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
let's start by taking a look at one the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
let's start by taking a look at one the
very<00:00:19.619> bottom<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.580> producers<00:00:21.180> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
very bottom we have the producers in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.929 
very bottom we have the producers in
this<00:00:21.869> case<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.439> phytoplankton

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
this case we have phytoplankton

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
this case we have phytoplankton
cyanobacteria<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.570> algae<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:25.680> those<00:00:25.859> are

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
cyanobacteria and algae now those are

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
cyanobacteria and algae now those are
not<00:00:26.010> producers<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.939> would<00:00:27.060> normally<00:00:27.240> be

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
not producers that we would normally be

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.650 
not producers that we would normally be
familiar<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> marine

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
familiar with but this is a marine

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.849 
familiar with but this is a marine
ecosystem<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.439> something<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.769> we

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
ecosystem so it's not something that we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.610 
ecosystem so it's not something that we
come<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.160> contact<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.030> often<00:00:33.620> producers

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
come in contact with as often producers

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
come in contact with as often producers
get<00:00:35.070> their<00:00:35.250> energy<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.030> Sun<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.630> make

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
get their energy from the Sun they make

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
get their energy from the Sun they make
their<00:00:37.079> own<00:00:37.110> food<00:00:37.649> through<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.100> process<00:00:38.579> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
producer that we might run into is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.319 
producer that we might run into is
autotroph<00:00:44.239> autotroph<00:00:45.270> meaning<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.289> their<00:00:46.739> own

something that's automatic happens on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
something that's automatic happens on
its<00:00:49.890> own<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.399> autotroph<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> able<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:51.750> its

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
food on its own remove up the food chain

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
food on its own remove up the food chain
we<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.550> labeled<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
we see that we have labeled here

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
we see that we have labeled here
herbivores<00:00:58.399> anything<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.699> unable<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
herbivores anything that is unable to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.160 
herbivores anything that is unable to
make<00:01:00.510> its<00:01:00.690> own<00:01:00.870> food<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:02.600> consumer<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
make its own food is a consumer so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.789 
make its own food is a consumer so
everything<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> range<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:07.560> consumer

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
everything in this range is a consumer

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
everything in this range is a consumer
ok<00:01:10.799> you'll<00:01:10.950> notice<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.240> amount<00:01:12.479> of

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ok you'll notice that the amount of

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.499 
ok you'll notice that the amount of
energy<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.320> each<00:01:13.650> level<00:01:13.979> decreases<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
energy in each level decreases as we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.710 
energy in each level decreases as we
rise<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.290> let's<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> start<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:17.159> with

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
rise so let's say we start out with

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
rise so let's say we start out with
90,000<00:01:19.640> kcal<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> energy<00:01:21.860> 90,000<00:01:22.860> kcal<00:01:23.250> isn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
90,000 kcal of energy 90,000 kcal isn't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
90,000 kcal of energy 90,000 kcal isn't
is<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> unit<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> energy<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.500> start<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.799> with

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is a unit of energy so we start out with

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
is a unit of energy so we start out with
90,000<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.820> these<00:01:26.939> units<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> energy<00:01:27.630> every

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
90,000 of these units of energy every

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
90,000 of these units of energy every
level<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> raise<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> energy

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
level that we raise on the energy

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
level that we raise on the energy
pyramid<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.950> down<00:01:32.189> by<00:01:32.460> 10%<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.720> have

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
pyramid we go down by 10% so now we have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.569 
pyramid we go down by 10% so now we have
9000<00:01:35.280> kcals<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.320> zooplankton<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.220> snails

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
9000 kcals the zooplankton the snails

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210 
9000 kcals the zooplankton the snails
and<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> urchins<00:01:39.570> these<00:01:40.259> herbivores<00:01:40.979> which

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and the urchins these herbivores which

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.179 
and the urchins these herbivores which
are<00:01:41.369> eating<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.360> phytoplankton

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
are eating the phytoplankton

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.620 
are eating the phytoplankton
cyanobacteria<00:01:44.189> analogy<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.479> were<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
cyanobacteria analogy if we were to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
cyanobacteria analogy if we were to
write<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> fruit<00:01:46.079> food<00:01:46.409> web<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.640> would<00:01:47.790> draw

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
write a fruit food web we would draw

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.490 
write a fruit food web we would draw
those<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.509> arrows<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.110> always<00:01:49.290> draw<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
those as arrows we always draw the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
those as arrows we always draw the
arrows<00:01:49.890> pointing<00:01:50.399> towards<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> mouth<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
arrows pointing towards the mouth of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.460 
arrows pointing towards the mouth of
what's<00:01:51.840> eating<00:01:52.170> them

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
what's eating them

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
what's eating them
so<00:01:52.829> these<00:01:52.950> zooplankton<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.390> other

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
so these zooplankton have to do other

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
so these zooplankton have to do other
things<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.700> reproduce<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.969> have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
things they have to reproduce they have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
things they have to reproduce they have
to<00:01:57.270> try<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> escape<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.409> things<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.950> are

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to try to escape from things that are

living<00:02:01.200> uses<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.740> energy<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.880> have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
living uses up energy so they don't have

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.389 
living uses up energy so they don't have
as<00:02:03.180> much<00:02:03.299> energy<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.710> level<00:02:04.979> below<00:02:05.100> them

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
as much energy as the level below them

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.089

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
so there's 9,000 kcal in these okay we

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.040 
so there's 9,000 kcal in these okay we
call<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.610> consumers<00:02:09.270> since<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
call these consumers since these are the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.670 
call these consumers since these are the
first<00:02:10.550> consumers<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:12.120> call<00:02:12.330> these<00:02:12.569> prime

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
first consumers we call these prime

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
first consumers we call these prime
consumers<00:02:18.379> as<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.590> move<00:02:19.769> further<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:21.120> start

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
consumers as we move further up we start

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.320 
consumers as we move further up we start
getting<00:02:21.510> into<00:02:21.769> carnivores<00:02:22.769> carnivores<00:02:23.700> they

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
getting into carnivores carnivores they

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.479 
getting into carnivores carnivores they
also<00:02:24.510> cannot<00:02:24.930> make<00:02:25.170> their<00:02:25.379> own<00:02:25.409> food<00:02:25.830> like

also cannot make their own food like

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.570 
also cannot make their own food like
producers<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.650> they<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.280> they

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
producers can so what they do is they

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.660 
producers can so what they do is they
eat<00:02:29.819> other<00:02:30.049> consumers<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.980> these<00:02:32.159> primary

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
eat other consumers so these primary

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.850

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
Eel the things that nothing else will

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.159 
Eel the things that nothing else will
prey<00:03:37.379> upon<00:03:37.849> okay<00:03:38.849> as<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.450> keep<00:03:39.599> moving<00:03:39.930> as<00:03:40.079> we

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
prey upon okay as we keep moving as we

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.439 
prey upon okay as we keep moving as we
said<00:03:40.379> each<00:03:40.590> level<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.190> 10%<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.060> energy<00:03:42.419> of

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
said each level is 10% of the energy of

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.159 
said each level is 10% of the energy of
the<00:03:42.690> level<00:03:43.199> below<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.129> there's<00:03:44.310> only<00:03:44.400> nine

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
the level below it so there's only nine

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.089 
the level below it so there's only nine
kcals<00:03:46.169> of<00:03:46.379> energy<00:03:46.799> left<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.699> system

kcals of energy left in the system

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.280 
kcals of energy left in the system
starting<00:03:50.099> at<00:03:50.269> 90,000<00:03:51.269> okay<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:51.959> what<00:03:52.169> that

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
starting at 90,000 okay so what that

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.920 
starting at 90,000 okay so what that
means<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.949> that<00:03:53.010> most<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.730> our<00:03:53.849> energy<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.480> at

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
means is that most of our energy is at

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.110 
means is that most of our energy is at
the<00:03:55.049> bottom<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.620> energy<00:03:55.919> pyramid<00:03:56.129> as<00:03:56.459> we

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
move up the amount of energy that's in

move up the amount of energy that's in
the<00:03:59.519> energy<00:04:00.000> pyramid<00:04:00.410> decreases<00:04:01.410> now<00:04:01.709> the

living<00:04:12.829> everything<00:04:14.359> that<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.389> consumer<00:04:16.049> can

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
living everything that a consumer can

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.550

also be referred to as a heterotroph
okay<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.099> a<00:04:23.130> consumer<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.330> heterotroph

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
okay so a consumer and a heterotroph

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.150 
okay so a consumer and a heterotroph
mean<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.979> same

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
look at another food pyramid to see what

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.270 
look at another food pyramid to see what
kind<00:05:22.580> of<00:05:22.610> questions<00:05:23.000> may<00:05:23.240> be<00:05:23.270> asked<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.840> a<00:05:23.870> test

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
kind of questions may be asked on a test

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.500 
kind of questions may be asked on a test
one<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.400> first<00:05:25.550> questions<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.360> may

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
one of the first questions that you may

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.420 
one of the first questions that you may
see<00:05:26.570> on<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> test<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.440> where<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:27.950> there<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.220> most

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
see on a test is where is there the most

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.700 
see on a test is where is there the most
energy<00:05:28.970> in<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.390> food<00:05:29.600> pyramid<00:05:29.870> as<00:05:30.170> we

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
energy in the food pyramid as we

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.800 
energy in the food pyramid as we
discussed<00:05:31.070> before<00:05:31.220> most<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.180> energy<00:05:32.600> is

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
discussed before most of the energy is

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.320 
discussed before most of the energy is
found<00:05:33.800> in<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.070> base<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.550> food<00:05:34.760> pyramid<00:05:35.000> as

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
found in the base of the food pyramid as

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.710 
found in the base of the food pyramid as
we<00:05:35.930> move<00:05:36.140> up<00:05:36.910> there's<00:05:37.910> less<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.480> less<00:05:38.540> energy

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
we move up there's less and less energy

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.930 
we move up there's less and less energy
again<00:05:41.720> that's<00:05:42.200> because<00:05:42.380> these<00:05:43.100> organisms<00:05:43.640> are

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
again that's because these organisms are

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.090 
again that's because these organisms are
having<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.510> undergo<00:05:44.930> life<00:05:45.260> activities<00:05:45.830> run

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
having to undergo life activities run

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.250 
having to undergo life activities run
away<00:05:46.340> from<00:05:46.420> things<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.600> are<00:05:47.690> trying<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:48.140> eat

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
away from things that are trying to eat

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.740 
away from things that are trying to eat
them<00:05:48.530> trying<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:48.950> go<00:05:49.070> get<00:05:49.250> food<00:05:49.490> themselves

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
them trying to go get food themselves

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.290 
them trying to go get food themselves
trying<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:50.870> find<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.470> mate<00:05:51.980> all<00:05:52.220> of<00:05:52.670> that<00:05:52.850> uses

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
trying to find a mate all of that uses

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.660 
trying to find a mate all of that uses
energy<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.740> higher<00:05:54.950> you<00:05:54.980> move<00:05:55.340> up<00:05:55.490> in<00:05:55.580> the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
energy so the higher you move up in the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.000 
energy so the higher you move up in the
food<00:05:55.850> chain<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.810> less<00:05:57.170> energy<00:05:57.380> that<00:05:57.710> there<00:05:57.860> is

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
food chain the less energy that there is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.940 
food chain the less energy that there is
contained<00:05:58.730> in<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:58.910> species<00:05:59.470> we<00:06:00.470> may<00:06:00.590> ask<00:06:00.770> you

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
contained in that species we may ask you

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.040 
contained in that species we may ask you
where<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.430> there<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.790> most<00:06:01.970> biomass<00:06:02.750> that

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
where is there the most biomass that

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.480 
where is there the most biomass that
just<00:06:03.350> means<00:06:03.560> where<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:03.980> there<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.250> most

just means where is there the most

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.260 
just means where is there the most
amount<00:06:05.060> of<00:06:05.330> these<00:06:05.660> organisms<00:06:06.140> okay<00:06:07.120> we<00:06:08.120> know

there's the most biomass down here at
the<00:06:11.300> base<00:06:13.060> as<00:06:14.060> we<00:06:14.420> move<00:06:14.630> up<00:06:15.430> we<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.550> less<00:06:16.790> and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
the base as we move up we have less and

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.230 
the base as we move up we have less and
less<00:06:17.090> biomass<00:06:18.610> all<00:06:19.610> right<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.000> makes

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
less biomass all right and that makes

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.770 
less biomass all right and that makes
sense<00:06:20.540> we<00:06:21.200> see<00:06:21.230> way<00:06:21.890> more<00:06:21.920> plants<00:06:22.760> than<00:06:23.300> we<00:06:23.540> do

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
sense we see way more plants than we do

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.760 
sense we see way more plants than we do
oh<00:06:24.020> spray<00:06:25.420> okay<00:06:26.420> we<00:06:26.570> may<00:06:26.690> also<00:06:26.870> ask<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.380> where

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
oh spray okay we may also ask you where

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.760 
oh spray okay we may also ask you where
are<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.100> heterotrophs<00:06:28.910> in<00:06:29.210> this<00:06:30.200> food<00:06:30.500> chain

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
are the heterotrophs in this food chain

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.230 
are the heterotrophs in this food chain
okay<00:06:31.670> heterotrophs<00:06:33.280> are<00:06:34.280> everything<00:06:35.000> that

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
okay heterotrophs are everything that

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.780 
okay heterotrophs are everything that
cannot<00:06:35.600> make<00:06:35.900> their<00:06:36.140> own<00:06:36.169> food<00:06:36.620> so<00:06:37.370> these

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
cannot make their own food so these

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.090 
cannot make their own food so these
represent<00:06:38.390> the<00:06:38.990> heterotrophs

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
represent the heterotrophs

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.470 
represent the heterotrophs
okay<00:06:41.090> heterotrophs<00:06:41.870> are<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.200> opposite<00:06:42.830> of

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
okay heterotrophs are the opposite of

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.810 
okay heterotrophs are the opposite of
autotrophs<00:06:44.920> heterotrophs<00:06:45.920> are<00:06:46.130> also<00:06:46.370> called

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820

consumers autotrophs are also called
producers<00:06:50.960> these<00:06:51.680> would<00:06:51.860> be<00:06:51.950> the<00:06:52.040> producers

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
producers these would be the producers

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.680 
producers these would be the producers
or<00:06:53.660> autotrophs<00:06:54.440> down<00:06:54.680> here<00:06:55.570> everything<00:06:56.570> in
