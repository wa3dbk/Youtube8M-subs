00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
tweak it will and it's a very useful

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.330 
tweak it will and it's a very useful
thing<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.439> use<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> daily

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
thing I use it daily

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
thing I use it daily
now<00:01:47.790> here's<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> did<00:01:48.810> put<00:01:48.990> together

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
now here's to that I did put together

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
now here's to that I did put together
into<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.740> example<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.369> they're<00:01:50.729> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
into one example because they're so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
into one example because they're so
close<00:01:51.329> together<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:52.500> called<00:01:52.649> die<00:01:52.890> bulletin

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
close together it's called die bulletin

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
close together it's called die bulletin
it<00:01:53.579> basically<00:01:53.850> shrinks<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.450> notification<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it basically shrinks your notification a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810 
it basically shrinks your notification a
little<00:01:55.500> bulletin<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.640> half

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
little bulletin right there so it's half

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.910 
little bulletin right there so it's half
the<00:01:56.850> size<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> takes<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.810> less<00:01:57.840> room<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.500> then

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the size it takes up less room and then

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
the size it takes up less room and then
there's<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.310> called<00:01:59.340> sticky<00:01:59.880> key<00:02:00.240> which<00:02:00.450> adds

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
there's one called sticky key which adds

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.450 
there's one called sticky key which adds
a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.020> X<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> top<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
a little X to the top right and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
a little X to the top right and
basically<00:02:03.240> keeps<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.719> frozen<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.229> place<00:02:04.380> until

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
basically keeps it frozen in place until

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
basically keeps it frozen in place until
you<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.219> press<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.640> X<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.149> dismiss<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.990> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you do press that X and dismiss it and I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
you do press that X and dismiss it and I
find<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.409> very<00:02:07.439> useful<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:07.979> sometimes<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
find it very useful because sometimes I

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
find it very useful because sometimes I
miss<00:02:08.879> text<00:02:09.239> messages<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.899> don't<00:02:10.110> see

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
miss text messages because I don't see

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.080 
miss text messages because I don't see
them<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:11.129> up<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.430> long<00:02:11.580> enough<00:02:11.730> and
