 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.179
 how to make a haircut that is performed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.370
 very simple and does not require much time 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.609
 The technique of weaving this braid is very similar 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 on the weaving of an ordinary French braid 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.840
 the difference is that from the side 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.840
 add for taste very fine strands and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 so it is necessary to separate the forehead strand of hair and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.869
 divide it into three equal parts and start 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.969
 weave a simple French braid 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.040
 on the left in the temporal region we separate in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.489
 thin strand of hair and add it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.930
 pigtails in the same way we separate the Turk 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 5 on the right and also add her pigtails 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.789
 continue to weave braid towards 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.789
 back of the head 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.590
 reaching the neck continue to weave 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.750
 pigtail but already without grabs from this 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.390
 pigtails at the same time pulling strands 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.790
 they need to be pulled upwards only with 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.580
 one side in this way should 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.470
 get an openwork braid when weaving 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.479
 on themselves it is preferably used 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.150
 styling products gel strong 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.600
 fixing helps when weaving but here 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.340
 will help remove sticking hairs 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.310
 small amount of gel or brain 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.540
 it is necessary to put only on hands they 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:51.210
 on the hair so as not to weight their tip 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.210
 braids we fasten silicone elastic band 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.830
 pigtail bent after all tsypko 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.710
 we fix the flower invisible 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 If desired, the flower can be decorated 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 decorative decoration if you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080
