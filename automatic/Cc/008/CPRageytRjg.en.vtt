00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.689
 ml 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.689
 is there 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.220
 Bird request 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.189
 3 hits with a few hits 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.839
 Let's collapse It's bad, anywhere, again and again 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.090
 It is said that I got well 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.669
 he 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.310
 It is said that I am fine with such words 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.400
 It is easy to understand. 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 The reaction is good 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.940
 That mental inside 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 The other four people who have almonds are 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.680
 Though 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.180
 In prefecture 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.060
 Admission 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.370
 Ando held because he can not hear the same score from Honda Fit 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.810
 In the Communist Party's examination, that word comes out 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 So 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 why 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.380
 I wonder if I can do it myself 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.600
 I can do it by 30 per second 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 Because there was more 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.750
 To that book 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.150
 Warmer words of hopper which we write in various ways in city 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.840
 Of course it will be impressed too 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.930
 that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.380
 Although there is a place where human beings can be easily cured that summer 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.910
 There is so much to be depressed 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 It looks like I do that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.290
 Not human 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.990
 I'm very happy if I think I can do it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.730
 Since 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.190
 The feeling of thanks is also softened 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.420
 Everybody is fine 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.140
 Said that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 I will fall again 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 That's the next best thing 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.520
 I found the stage 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 Can be relied upon 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 That is the best thing that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 Yup 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.299
 Easy thing 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.280
 Everybody can heal but there are many who grow up 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.459
 That's right 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.739
 After all 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.749
 Well, each and every one 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.109
 I think I know the difference in the environment 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.109
 The way you are involved is different though 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.030
 I think 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.129
 Are you going to work in teams with people? 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.589
 That's that type 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:30.919
 Even a disgusting person 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 It's okay or not, I agree 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.799
 Ordered that job return 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.309
 Number of throws 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.459
 France has changed 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.679
 That's why I'm going to have a feeling 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.759
 Nut with height won 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.599
 If you assume conflict 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.419
 It happens to the side ground 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.659
 1622 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.079
 In an email that only I earn 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.529
 Involvement with people who can not think 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.439
 ict advance people changed 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.969
 It is also said that Phalaenopsis is fine 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 Because I think people will change 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.290
 From now on compiled I have passed through such comments 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.309
 so 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:21.789
 Conversely, you should think that it was good here and this 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.359
 you know 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.659
 No way too 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.629
 I had the opportunity to be in Taiwan 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.629
 Itoi Shigesato Itoi because the difficult course has changed 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.059
 It is because only the person who guided 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.419
 I will make it well, and it will continue soon 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.049
 It will disappear, though 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.299
 I haven't seen me now almost all day 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.749
 But I have not grown up at all 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.749
 I thought of that mutter here 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.639
 But I can't go through saying or 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.199
 Negative and funny about it 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.339
 It will be difficult if it comes out more and more after that 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.649
 So expensive 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.579
 It is not such a thing so as to be based while at home 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.899
 And 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.289
 This decline is part of that now 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.629
 What do you do now? 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.379
 It is said that the leader and one stroke difference in the local people 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.830
 So I think everyone will do it 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.759
 I 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.759
 Itoi second 2 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 Thank you host and 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.199
 It will be 10 knots which will be the largest season this season as freshly picked rice 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.789
 It's not a batch. 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.340
 Still hold by hand 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.920
 While taking care of ip around 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.669
 Therefore I play against 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.020
 Each 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.199
 Fresh boom 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.139
 is there 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.080
 However
