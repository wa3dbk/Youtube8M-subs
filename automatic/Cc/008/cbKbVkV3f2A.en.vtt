00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
ground and you know see if CNN or BBC is

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.770 
ground and you know see if CNN or BBC is
interested<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.120> actually<00:03:39.240> doing<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.630> segment

interested in actually doing the segment

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.290 
interested in actually doing the segment
it's<00:03:40.080> probably<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.640> most<00:03:41.760> important<00:03:42.240> thing

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
it's probably the most important thing

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.660 
it's probably the most important thing
in<00:03:42.540> transitioning<00:03:43.050> from<00:03:43.230> modeling<00:03:43.650> into<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
in transitioning from modeling into the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.080 
in transitioning from modeling into the
future<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.380> news<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:46.530> animals<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.670> would

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
future of news for animals so I would

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.030 
future of news for animals so I would
say<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:49.080> know<00:03:49.200> what<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.740> that's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
say you know what I think that that's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.940

probably<00:03:51.050> having<00:03:52.050> something<00:03:52.290> greater<00:03:52.560> than

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
probably having something greater than

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.699 
probably having something greater than
just<00:03:53.490> being<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:54.000> model<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.230> important

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
just being a model is so important

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.949 
just being a model is so important
