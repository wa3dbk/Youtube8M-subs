with your head coach dealing with your
team<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.369> good<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
team that could not be good for that

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
team that could not be good for that
could<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.330> detrimental<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> team<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
could be very detrimental to a team so I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
could be very detrimental to a team so I
think<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.430> formulas<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.299> though<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
think up formulas out there though I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
think up formulas out there though I
think<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> veteran<00:01:13.470> coach<00:01:13.710> who's<00:01:13.950> strong<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
think a veteran coach who's strong I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
think a veteran coach who's strong I
think<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.030> offensive<00:01:15.420> coordinator<00:01:15.869> who<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
think an offensive coordinator who is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
think an offensive coordinator who is
secure<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> veteran<00:01:17.610> quarterback<00:01:18.210> who

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
secure I think a veteran quarterback who

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
secure I think a veteran quarterback who
can<00:01:18.570> handle<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.049> type<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.530> deal<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
can handle that type of a deal and a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
can handle that type of a deal and a
team<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:20.790> playoff<00:01:21.360> aspirations<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
team that has playoff aspirations and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
team that has playoff aspirations and
going<00:01:22.530> deeper<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.790> type<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.270> team

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
going deeper is the right type of a team

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120
