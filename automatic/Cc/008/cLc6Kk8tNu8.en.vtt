people on the forums have said that you
need<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.589> use<00:00:54.390> mopar<00:00:55.390> o<00:00:55.690> 2<00:00:56.680> sensors<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:59.939> this

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:00.939 
need to use mopar o 2 sensors but this

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:02.759 
need to use mopar o 2 sensors but this
says<00:01:01.239> it's<00:01:01.479> specifically<00:01:02.170> designed<00:01:02.320> for

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
says it's specifically designed for

says it's specifically designed for
Jeeps<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.790> we'll<00:01:04.360> try<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.629> out<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.049> see<00:01:05.229> if

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
Jeeps so we'll try it out and see if

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.690 
Jeeps so we'll try it out and see if
that<00:01:05.560> works<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.500> p0<00:01:09.040> 1<00:01:09.250> 3<00:01:09.490> 5

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
that works this is the so the p0 1 3 5

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.760 
that works this is the so the p0 1 3 5

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.190 
and here's the new one pretty much just
take<00:03:32.220> off<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.640> cap<00:03:32.970> screw<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.960> back<00:03:34.140> in

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
take off this cap screw it back in

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.820 
take off this cap screw it back in
connect<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.040> harness<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.410> then<00:03:37.410> take<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.710> to

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
connect the harness and then take it to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.360 
connect the harness and then take it to
the<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:39.150> go<00:03:39.270> riley's<00:03:39.720> or<00:03:39.930> autozone<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the to go riley's or autozone get the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.370 
the to go riley's or autozone get the
codes<00:03:41.610> cleared<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.840> make<00:03:43.290> sure<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:44.750> new<00:03:45.750> o2

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
codes cleared so make sure the new o2

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.310 
codes cleared so make sure the new o2
sensor<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.400> tightly<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.270> then<00:03:49.200> you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
sensor is on there tightly and then you

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.690 
sensor is on there tightly and then you
may<00:03:49.470> want<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.860> get<00:03:50.280> get<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.210> harness<00:03:51.810> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
may want to get get this harness and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.270 
may want to get get this harness and
loop<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:55.070> around<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:59.720> grounding<00:04:00.720> wire

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
loop it up around this grounding wire

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.680 
loop it up around this grounding wire
and<00:04:02.280> then<00:04:02.459> connect<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.450> other<00:04:03.600> end

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
and then connect it to the other end

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.610 
and then connect it to the other end
there<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.520> so<00:04:05.520> it's<00:04:05.700> not<00:04:05.880> touching<00:04:06.620> anything

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
there just so it's not touching anything

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.840 
there just so it's not touching anything
and<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.790> won't<00:04:08.970> get<00:04:09.120> shorted<00:04:09.630> out<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:14.459> that

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
and it won't get shorted out so that

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.360 
and it won't get shorted out so that
should<00:04:15.150> be<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.780> replacing<00:04:16.620> your<00:04:16.919> o2

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
should be it for replacing your o2

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.800 
should be it for replacing your o2
sensor<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.260> again<00:04:19.859> if<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.880> p0

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
sensor this is again if you have the p0

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.100 
sensor this is again if you have the p0
