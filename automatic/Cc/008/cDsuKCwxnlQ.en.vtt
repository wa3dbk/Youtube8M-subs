00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
hello today we'll be looking at the move

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.100 
hello today we'll be looking at the move
collide<00:00:20.550> overdrive<00:00:21.000> pedal<00:00:21.300> I'll<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.869> running

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
collide overdrive pedal I'll be running

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.230 
collide overdrive pedal I'll be running
this<00:00:22.230> through<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> Fender<00:00:23.279> Stratocaster<00:00:23.520> on

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this through a Fender Stratocaster on

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.300 
this through a Fender Stratocaster on
the<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.110> moment<00:00:25.410> home<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.860> neck<00:00:26.040> to<00:00:26.160> go

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the at the moment home on the neck to go

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
the at the moment home on the neck to go
and<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:29.099> amp<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.610> moment<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> PVD<00:00:30.630> band

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and the amp at the moment is a PVD band

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700 
and the amp at the moment is a PVD band
at<00:00:31.050> work<00:00:31.200> for

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
at work for

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:42.819 
at work for
so<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> true<00:00:32.910> bypass<00:00:33.270> channel

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.590 

so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> turn<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> pedal<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.999> you<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.359> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so if you turn the pedal on you get a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
so if you turn the pedal on you get a
lot<00:00:46.109> more<00:00:46.140> warm<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.429> game<00:00:47.609> low<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
lot more warm and with the game low it's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:00.950 
lot more warm and with the game low it's
just<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.739> more<00:00:49.769> sustained

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.799 

this<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.170> could<00:01:02.320> also<00:01:02.470> kind<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.070> get<00:01:03.250> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this you could also kind of get that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.480 
this you could also kind of get that
skin<00:01:04.809> sounds<00:01:05.800> that<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.040> get<00:01:06.220> from<00:01:06.370> your

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
skin sounds that you get from your

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:28.200 
skin sounds that you get from your
fingers<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:06.880> play<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.360> kind<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.630> foods<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:28.150> well

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
fingers and play a kind of foods as well

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.490 
fingers and play a kind of foods as well
as<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.510> turn<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.690> gate<00:01:28.960> off<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.260> could<00:01:29.410> do

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
as you turn the gate off you could do

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500 
as you turn the gate off you could do
more<00:01:29.620> things<00:01:29.830> eeeh<00:01:30.100> more<00:01:30.310> sustain<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.000> then

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
more things eeeh more sustain and then

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.990 
more things eeeh more sustain and then
you<00:01:31.630> could<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.130> go<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> more<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
you could kind of go to more of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.930 
you could kind of go to more of the
heavy<00:01:34.270> sets<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:35.440> distortion<00:01:36.370> spectra<00:01:36.790> my

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
heavy sets and distortion spectra my

00:01:36.940 --> 00:02:21.959 
heavy sets and distortion spectra my
power<00:01:37.420> cords

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.369 

and<00:02:22.969> a<00:02:23.120> unique<00:02:23.450> characteristic<00:02:24.049> about<00:02:24.200> this

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
and a unique characteristic about this

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.099 
and a unique characteristic about this
pedal<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.639> has<00:02:25.790> switch<00:02:26.480> between<00:02:26.659> hall

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
pedal is that it has switch between hall

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.800 
pedal is that it has switch between hall
and<00:02:27.409> room<00:02:28.010> right<00:02:28.670> now<00:02:28.819> sunroom<00:02:29.329> which<00:02:29.659> is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and room right now sunroom which is

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.449 
and room right now sunroom which is
basically<00:02:30.109> normal<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.799> as<00:02:30.889> you<00:02:30.980> moved<00:02:31.189> up<00:02:31.340> to

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
basically normal and as you moved up to

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.319 
basically normal and as you moved up to
halt<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:33.379> mid-range<00:02:33.829> boost<00:02:34.219> and<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.670> gain

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
halt the mid-range boost and the gain

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.030 
halt the mid-range boost and the gain
actually<00:02:35.749> boosts<00:02:36.109> so<00:02:36.260> it's<00:02:36.439> kind<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.799> boost

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
actually boosts so it's kind of a boost

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.170 
actually boosts so it's kind of a boost
nom<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.329> then<00:02:38.569> they<00:02:39.530> call<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.889> ha<00:02:40.069> because<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
nom but then they call it ha because the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.660 
nom but then they call it ha because the
by<00:02:42.139> bringing<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.859> mid-range<00:02:43.159> in<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.519> gay

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
by bringing up the mid-range in the gay

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.030 
by bringing up the mid-range in the gay
and<00:02:43.819> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.840> tone<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.469> becomes<00:02:45.709> big

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
and kind of the tone and it becomes big

00:02:46.040 --> 00:03:16.580 
and kind of the tone and it becomes big
aha

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.620 

and<00:03:17.590> when<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.010> turn<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> tone<00:03:18.550> up<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
and when you turn the tone up the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.780 
and when you turn the tone up the
trebles<00:03:20.050> donation<00:03:20.590> increases<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.280> it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
trebles donation increases and it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.190 
trebles donation increases and it
becomes<00:03:21.910> more<00:03:22.300> solid<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:22.990> can<00:03:23.110> be

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
becomes more solid so you can be

00:03:23.200 --> 00:04:09.540 
becomes more solid so you can be
champions

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.680
