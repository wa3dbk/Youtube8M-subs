00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.050
 my name is Sasha we have such 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.210
 iron man slash how healthy he is 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.960
 here consists of very very many many 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.430
 details and give it we will see everything 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.350
 and in the shade of parts 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.170
 well then gold is worth it not only with 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.350
 debut logical here and many with him 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.079
 go here is such a block between your legs 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.000
 him and his hands as well 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.250
 many items and now tell you where 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.940
 I had trouble assembling 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.739
 to make it easier to collect Well 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.239
 collected it from a photo with so I 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.649
 draw on because if not much 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.620
 the waist came out a lot 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.510
 and they immediately all stuck together and by the way 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.670
 saying here and so these here are two parts 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.010
 where their legs are clear body here here 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.570
 such tones of things in them are obtained 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 here there is still extra space 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.340
 so he just doesn't go places 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.989
 remain after the gluing so they 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.299
 so here ugly cropped because 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.619
 what did you think they might come in handy said 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.200
 something legs and she's not at all 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.179
 nothing came in handy and so but so 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.070
 That is ugly that month refused 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.480
 glue 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.840
 he also has these types 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.490
 wearing his shoes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.620
 forget to stick them too because 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.030
 only knew where to glue these two 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.220
 block because damn 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 left they two d'vy where are they 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.140
 stick you stick them horror 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.630
 some was and betray them where 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 attach it so here is higher then of course 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.979
 Immediately it is clear that this is this body 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.619
 so this one will make him sick ahead 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.180
 Of course, a beautiful account can 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.400
 this ancestors look no like 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 picture it before you need somewhere ahead 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.060
 here it is for come it probably is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 something common in it should go beautiful 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.130
 video patterns are not so much bright 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.410
 also not so much well, that the head does not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.080
 I have to go in the middle I glued it 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.720
 in front, yes, this is my fault 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.490
 I thought that there is a correspondent marking and cleaning 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.009
 the squares are so tiny there 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.200
 yellow blue different shots here on 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.119
 jun ki there I thought it was necessary 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.489
 square box glued chambers 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.230
 looked that it would be better to give her already 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.269
 glue passeri fishing rods 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.140
 so what is the front is not very 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.900
 pretty well, that the hands on consist of 4 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.540
 details and even more well yes principle 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.640
 consists of 4 this here such here 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.860
 simple block that you will have open 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.079
 This is the beginning of the hand so 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.510
 pretty block this is not us elbow 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.180
 stalk most beautiful probably block it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.630
 here's the continuation of the arm and the end of the arm 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.920
 these are two blocks here and mixed up 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.180
 and what side is this little white one 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 it was inside here so here these 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.019
 the little yellow stuff they stick 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.239
 their cool after torment stick here 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.430
 here on hand as if complement and and I do not 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.010
 I remember that they do what they give in general 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.800
 here so here they look here 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.500
 he got me a video then a knife trick 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.630
 curve so often happens in the icon yah 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.420
 thin when I glue with glue anally this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.760
 arched for it happens such a bullshit but 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.040
 In principle, nothing terrible, and here 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 here come such things on the shoulders but they 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.720
 unfortunately and not stick simply 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 dress but there is a limit but there 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.860
 turn out look there turns out 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.690
 empty space half barking 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.270
 here's a block and just but so here 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.950
 worn she first kept well 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.290
 but then when he put it anyway 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.570
 stocking donated filed pawel pavel 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.640
 I took his psihanula shorter taped 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.770
 so that it does not fall because when 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.600
 the first time you wear it will be tight a 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.760
 then it stretches and the pressure again 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.250
 falls off and it is thought not to lose 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.290
 better stick Well but pin 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.840
 collected just as well consist gleam 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 of the two such parts in the center this 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.560
 here it is a stick by the way 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.600
 limit I first to the body in the center 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.400
 then I have already stuck it to his feet 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.290
 everything was exactly and see that he 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.200
 there even though many here came out 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.090
 a little crooked otherwise otherwise if here 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.460
 Here they did not come out would not be crooked exactly 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.050
 tom he would not be standing like that 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.220
 there is a video it costs exactly then he 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.840
 It stood like this , and you even 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.570
 can not estimate for many went so this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.220
 so there would be diagonally I thought it was 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.140
 it will be ugly and better stick there 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.570
 discipline is better so there because she doesn't 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.820
 can be seen in the tone is well and exactly 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.690
 no way he has a video very well 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.580
 holding on 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.950
 and even here such feet and already about 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.050
 they said these here socks well and in 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.610
 In principle, this is all as a kind of Tolik 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.920
 very much and best at first 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 express just glue to make 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.910
 just understand and put off which hand 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.950
 what leg goes what detail to i im 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.180
 did just that if it were not 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.550
 I probably would have done it 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.800
 and did not collect especially difficulties he did not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.230
 It was spring that it was a long time 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.360
 sweep takes as much as 4 sheets by the way 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.150
 saying typing on all four sheets then 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.980
 there is one part per sheet and you see 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.450
 he turned out well yes pretty big 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.060
 and for how many ten centimeters here 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.870
 or fifteen to a height wide somewhere 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.640
 also a massive thing well, just like that 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.050
 here is the figure we have today well what guys 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.280
 I hope you liked the link to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.500
 the recipe in the description under the video 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.400
 Sasha and the iron man were with you 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.400
 bye everyone
