yeah we say playing the game is often

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.490 
yeah we say playing the game is often
not<00:01:29.030> playing<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.479> game<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.929> we've<00:01:30.170> we've

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
not playing the game so we've we've

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.200 
not playing the game so we've we've

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
down other players and then speed points

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.740 
down other players and then speed points
for<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.000> which<00:01:41.179> takes<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.479> up<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.630> most

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
the first thing is going to do is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.710 
the first thing is going to do is
bachelor<00:02:37.640> together<00:02:37.910> right<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.570> that's
