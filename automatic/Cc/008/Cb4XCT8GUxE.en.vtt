just kind of weird-looking

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
just kind of weird-looking
I<00:00:45.629> never<00:00:46.110> used<00:00:46.350> boxes<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.039> China<00:00:47.309> every<00:00:48.180> time

I've ordered something from China it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.689 
I've ordered something from China it's
always<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.239> wrapped<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> present

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
always just wrapped up like a present

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.830 
always just wrapped up like a present
with<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> bubble<00:00:54.510> wrap<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
with a little bit of bubble wrap in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.650 
with a little bit of bubble wrap in
there<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:58.070> as<00:00:59.070> long<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> box<00:00:59.789> isn't

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
there but as long as the box isn't

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.119 
there but as long as the box isn't
damaged<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> guess<00:01:01.670> there's<00:01:02.670> no<00:01:02.820> real<00:01:03.979> point<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
layer of bubble wrap on it by the way I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
layer of bubble wrap on it by the way I
got<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> new<00:01:21.210> futon<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.470> case<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> didn't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
from my desk so it might make it a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
from my desk so it might make it a
little<00:01:29.340> bit<00:01:29.780> harder<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:32.450> get<00:01:33.450> things<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> the

searched on eBay

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.990 
searched on eBay
when<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.799> looking<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.519> kit<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
when I was looking to get this kit and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
when I was looking to get this kit and
they<00:03:18.090> didn't<00:03:18.359> have<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.040> that's<00:03:20.040> why<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
they didn't have one so that's why I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.839 
they didn't have one so that's why I
went<00:03:20.489> ahead<00:03:20.579> with<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.910> shin<00:03:21.599> Matsunaga<00:03:22.109> Zaku

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
went ahead with a shin Matsunaga Zaku

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.970 
went ahead with a shin Matsunaga Zaku
but<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.030> next<00:03:24.269> time<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:24.540> find<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.319> will<00:03:25.680> try

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
but the next time I find one I will try

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.280 
but the next time I find one I will try
and<00:03:26.040> get<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.370> special<00:03:26.730> cowl<00:03:27.480> Gucci<00:03:27.900> version

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and get that special cowl Gucci version

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.349 
and get that special cowl Gucci version
because<00:03:29.129> I<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.430> think<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.730> looks<00:03:29.760> really

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
because I just think it looks really

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.270 
because I just think it looks really
cool<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.769> some<00:03:31.980> odd<00:03:32.190> reason<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:34.280> bags

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
cool and for some odd reason the bags

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.069 
cool and for some odd reason the bags
are<00:03:35.699> staples<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> side<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.639> box

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
are staples to the side of the box

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.809 
are staples to the side of the box
there's<00:03:40.079> like<00:03:40.319> four<00:03:40.709> staples<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.549> inside

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
there's like four staples on the inside

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.780 
there's like four staples on the inside
of<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.000> box<00:03:42.209> here<00:03:43.099> where<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.280> bags<00:03:44.489> are

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
of the box here where the bags are

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.809 
of the box here where the bags are
stapled<00:03:45.269> onto<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.690> box<00:03:46.099> that's<00:03:47.099> kind<00:03:47.669> of<00:03:47.729> odd

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
stapled onto the box that's kind of odd

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.979 
stapled onto the box that's kind of odd
you<00:03:50.819> know<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> guess<00:03:51.389> they<00:03:51.540> were<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:51.659> trying

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
you know I guess they were just trying

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.550 
you know I guess they were just trying
to<00:03:52.049> make<00:03:52.229> sure<00:03:52.260> stuff<00:03:52.799> didn't<00:03:54.199> get<00:03:55.199> thrown

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
to make sure stuff didn't get thrown

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.469 
to make sure stuff didn't get thrown
around<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.220> messed<00:03:56.400> up<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.879> potentially

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
around and messed up and potentially

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.580 
around and messed up and potentially
broken<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.769> guess<00:03:59.669> I<00:03:59.849> have<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.379> commend<00:04:01.379> them

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
broken so I guess I have to commend them

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.300 
broken so I guess I have to commend them
for<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.949> but<00:04:02.549> uh<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:04.560> was<00:04:04.709> pretty<00:04:04.859> much<00:04:05.040> it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
for that but uh that was pretty much it

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.009 
for that but uh that was pretty much it
I<00:04:05.340> only<00:04:05.489> got<00:04:05.729> this<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:06.359> thing<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.930> this

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
I only got this one thing in this

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.339 
I only got this one thing in this
package<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:08.419> guess<00:04:09.419> that'll<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.810> pretty

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
package so I guess that'll be pretty

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.240 
package so I guess that'll be pretty
much<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:11.639> review<00:04:11.819> although<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:13.379> do
