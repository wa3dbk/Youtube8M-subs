demonstrate great let's go and zoom in a

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.069 
demonstrate great let's go and zoom in a
little<00:00:49.550> closer

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
little closer

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.040 
little closer
okay<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:51.320> instrument<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:53.060> going<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.780> be

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
okay this instrument is is going to be

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.069 
okay this instrument is is going to be
is<00:00:54.470> going<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.940> enable<00:00:55.940> us<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.149> check<00:00:56.660> for<00:00:56.870> cold

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
is going to enable us to check for cold

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.100 
is going to enable us to check for cold
spots<00:00:57.880> one<00:00:58.880> of<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.059> unique<00:00:59.420> features<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.809> this

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
spots one of the unique features of this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.290 
spots one of the unique features of this
instrument<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.829> its<00:01:01.130> starburst<00:01:01.970> laser

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
instrument is its starburst laser

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.569 
instrument is its starburst laser
pointer<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.140> what<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.739> does<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.339> it

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
pointer and what that does is it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.200 
pointer and what that does is it
represents<00:01:05.210> one<00:01:05.930> half<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.649> target<00:01:07.210> spot

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
represents one half of the target spot

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.870 
represents one half of the target spot
size<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.750> diameter<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:10.220> an<00:01:10.520> eight<00:01:10.729> to

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
size the diameter this is an eight to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.630 
size the diameter this is an eight to
one<00:01:11.030> ratio<00:01:11.510> which<00:01:11.750> means<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.530> from<00:01:13.400> eight

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
one ratio which means that from eight

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.340 
one ratio which means that from eight
inches<00:01:14.030> away<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:15.409> target<00:01:15.710> spot<00:01:16.190> normally<00:01:16.880> is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
inches away the target spot normally is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.580 
inches away the target spot normally is
one<00:01:18.350> inch<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.520> laser<00:01:19.909> dot<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.570> half<00:01:21.200> an<00:01:21.409> inch

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
one inch that laser dot is half an inch

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.520 
one inch that laser dot is half an inch
in<00:01:21.770> diameter<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:23.299> as<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.600> move<00:01:23.780> back<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.350> can

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
in diameter so as you move back you can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.550 
in diameter so as you move back you can
see<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.830> grow<00:01:25.100> as<00:01:25.760> long<00:01:26.150> as<00:01:26.450> you're<00:01:26.750> within<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
see it grow as long as you're within the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.410 
see it grow as long as you're within the
starburst<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.460> know<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.700> have<00:01:28.940> an<00:01:29.060> accurate

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
starburst you know you have an accurate

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.750 
starburst you know you have an accurate
measurement<00:01:29.950> now<00:01:30.950> I'm<00:01:31.070> going<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.340> proceed<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
measurement now I'm going to proceed to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.429 
measurement now I'm going to proceed to
demonstrate<00:01:32.630> how<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:34.780> alarm<00:01:35.780> set<00:01:36.080> points

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
demonstrate how the alarm set points

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.260 
demonstrate how the alarm set points
work

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270

point<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.480> hit<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:46.370> cold<00:02:46.640> water

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500

turns<00:02:51.680> blue<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.670> there's<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.140> slow<00:02:54.730> beeping

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
turns blue and it there's a slow beeping

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.970 
turns blue and it there's a slow beeping
sound<00:02:56.140> indicating<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.500> temperature<00:02:57.920> is

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
sound indicating that the temperature is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.310 
sound indicating that the temperature is
below<00:02:58.130> your<00:02:58.400> setpoint<00:02:58.880> as<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.959> move<00:03:00.170> away

below your setpoint as you move away

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.080 
below your setpoint as you move away
from<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.100> becomes<00:03:01.430> normal<00:03:01.640> again

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
from that it becomes normal again

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.270 
from that it becomes normal again
because<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.110> temperature<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:04.100> you

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
because this is the temperature that you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.000 
because this is the temperature that you
had<00:03:04.430> previously<00:03:04.970> acquired<00:03:05.440> now<00:03:06.440> as<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.799> hit<00:03:06.980> a

target that is warmer as you can see now
this<00:03:10.730> laptop<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.720> 27<00:03:12.500> degrees<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.420> more
