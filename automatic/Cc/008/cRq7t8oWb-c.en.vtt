on there to make it look like sprinkles

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.319 
on there to make it look like sprinkles
and<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.569> can<00:04:05.750> also<00:04:05.959> use<00:04:06.169> a<00:04:06.620> cotton<00:04:07.329> cotton

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
and you can also use a cotton cotton

and you can also use a cotton cotton
bowl<00:04:08.629> for<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.290> guess<00:04:09.979> I<00:04:10.010> shouldn't<00:04:10.400> use<00:04:10.549> a

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
bowl for this I guess I shouldn't use a

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.530 
bowl for this I guess I shouldn't use a
cotton<00:04:10.849> bowl<00:04:12.579> let's<00:04:13.579> try<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.090> cotton

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
cotton bowl let's try that with cotton

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:42.460 
cotton bowl let's try that with cotton
balls<00:04:14.750> see<00:04:15.159> all<00:04:16.159> right<00:04:16.370> let<00:04:17.060> me<00:04:17.090> go<00:04:17.329> fine

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.440 

okay<00:04:43.470> i<00:04:43.500> play<00:04:43.830> we<00:04:44.010> did<00:04:44.190> we<00:04:44.580> do<00:04:44.790> not<00:04:45.000> have<00:04:45.600> one<00:04:46.280> so
