00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
hydrating which I really liked for a

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.490 
hydrating which I really liked for a
while<00:00:54.200> but<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.430> did<00:00:56.000> one<00:00:56.390> switch<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.170> something

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
while but I did one switch to something

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.240 
while but I did one switch to something
that<00:00:57.829> was<00:00:58.040> still<00:00:58.579> safely<00:00:58.880> and<00:00:59.800> had<00:01:00.800> fewer

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
that was still safely and had fewer

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.220 
that was still safely and had fewer
silicones<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.360> don't<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.079> know<00:01:03.200> I

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
silicones in it don't you know I

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.879 
silicones in it don't you know I
switched<00:01:03.770> event<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.840> this<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.229> virtue<00:01:06.289> co

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:06.889 
switched event and this is a virtue co

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:09.849 
switched event and this is a virtue co
and<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:08.060> was<00:01:08.210> using<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.600> for<00:01:08.899> a<00:01:08.960> while<00:01:09.139> I<00:01:09.530> don't

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
and I was using that for a while I don't

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.770 
and I was using that for a while I don't
mind<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.280> herbal<00:01:10.609> smell<00:01:10.939> but<00:01:11.359> it<00:01:11.420> was<00:01:11.749> a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
mind the herbal smell but it was a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.190 
mind the herbal smell but it was a
little<00:01:12.170> bit<00:01:12.380> difficult<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:13.210> risk<00:01:14.210> out<00:01:14.539> and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
little bit difficult to risk out and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.910 
little bit difficult to risk out and
