00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
different from what a buzzard is because

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.100 
different from what a buzzard is because
it<00:00:47.250> does<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.550> missiles<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> does

have the machine gun and is a fairly
cool<00:00:51.270> helicopter<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> reason<00:00:53.010> why<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> like

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

this helicopter over the Maverick is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
this helicopter over the Maverick is
because<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.620> course<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.309> machine<00:00:56.699> guns

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because of course it has machine guns

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
because of course it has machine guns
and<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.870> carry<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.770> think

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and because it can carry up to I think

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
and because it can carry up to I think
six<00:00:59.340> people<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> pretty<00:01:00.510> cool<00:01:01.100> with

annihilators<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.610> map

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
annihilators here right now on the map

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
annihilators here right now on the map
it's<00:01:15.000> fairly<00:01:15.210> simple<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.110> sort

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's fairly simple to get to it's sort

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's fairly simple to get to it's sort
of<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> middle<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.000> map<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of like in the middle of the map so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.030 
of like in the middle of the map so
check<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> mouth

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
check it out right here in the mouth

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.850 
check it out right here in the mouth
let's<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
let's see it's right here and there you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.999 
let's see it's right here and there you
are

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
are

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
are
c6<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.549> right<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> middle<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.360> easy

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
c6 we're right in the middle very easy

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
c6 we're right in the middle very easy
to<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.560> climb<00:01:25.799> some

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
ladders let's jump into the next one

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
ladders let's jump into the next one
there<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> next<00:01:30.150> location<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.780> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
there we go so this next location is on

believe it is or some kind of station

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.840 
believe it is or some kind of station
not<00:02:52.260> sure<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.950> there's<00:02:53.160> normally<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
not sure but there's normally a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.240 
not sure but there's normally a
helicopter<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> back<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.980> course

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's another annihilated now I thought

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's another annihilated now I thought
these<00:02:58.260> were<00:02:58.440> rare<00:02:58.739> at<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.040> point<00:02:59.280> but<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.550> guess

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
these were rare at one point but I guess

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.520
