it's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.670> weird<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.149> then<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it's a little weird and then for the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
it's a little weird and then for the
first<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.229> ever<00:01:43.469> it's<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> feature<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
DLC of a gun which is called the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
DLC of a gun which is called the
peacemaker<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.969> an<00:01:48.119> SMG<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.719> kind<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> looks

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
peacemaker it's an SMG it kind of looks

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.959 
peacemaker it's an SMG it kind of looks
like<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> cross<00:01:49.409> between<00:01:49.469> a<00:01:49.950> spectra<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.759> an

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
like a cross between a spectra and an

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.730 
like a cross between a spectra and an
assault<00:01:51.329> rifle<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.590> really

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
assault rifle that's a really really

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
assault rifle that's a really really
cool<00:01:53.149> submachine<00:01:54.149> gun<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:54.960> gonna

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
cool submachine gun I think it's gonna

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.920 
cool submachine gun I think it's gonna
be<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> multiplayer<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
be a multiplayer because you see the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.120 
be a multiplayer because you see the
camel<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> has<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
camel that it has on there and it's a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
camel that it has on there and it's a
special<00:01:59.460> camera<00:01:59.640> again<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.060> being<00:02:00.149> part<00:02:00.359> of<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
special camera again for being part of a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.279 
special camera again for being part of a
call<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> duty<00:02:02.280> elite<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.719> mean<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.079> can't

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
call of duty elite so I mean you can't

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.840 
call of duty elite so I mean you can't
put<00:02:04.469> camels<00:02:04.859> and<00:02:04.979> zombies<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.609> I'm<00:02:05.729> assuming

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
put camels and zombies so I'm assuming

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.450 
put camels and zombies so I'm assuming
it's<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> multiplayer<00:02:07.460> downloadable

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's gonna be a multiplayer downloadable

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's gonna be a multiplayer downloadable
gun<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.880> hopefully<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.350> bit

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
gun and hopefully it's a little bit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.600 
gun and hopefully it's a little bit
better<00:02:10.560> than<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.950> SNP's<00:02:11.220> some<00:02:11.460> people

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
better than the other SNP's some people

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.710 
better than the other SNP's some people
are<00:02:11.700> complaining<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.360> might<00:02:12.540> be

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
are complaining that it might be

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.330
