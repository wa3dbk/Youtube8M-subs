she ate some random object again but I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.979 
she ate some random object again but I
really<00:01:02.760> hope<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.120> isn't<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> case<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> I

really hope that isn't the case and I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.299 
really hope that isn't the case and I
hope<00:01:04.140> she<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.530> has<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> flu<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:05.100> something

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
hope she just has the flu or something

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.499 
hope she just has the flu or something

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
it's a specialist and so they really

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.009 
it's a specialist and so they really
wanted<00:04:05.970> me<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> do<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.329> here<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.810> know<00:04:06.900> the
