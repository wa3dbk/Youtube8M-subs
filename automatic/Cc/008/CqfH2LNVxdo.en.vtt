great<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.170> looks<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.680> it'll<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> great<00:01:29.579> one

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
great it looks like it'll be great one

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179 
great it looks like it'll be great one
it's<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> Wii<00:01:31.470> Remote<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's kind of like the Wii Remote if you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
it's kind of like the Wii Remote if you
ever<00:01:32.369> had<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> Wii<00:01:33.030> Remote<00:01:33.320> where<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
ever had a Wii Remote where you have to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
ever had a Wii Remote where you have to
tighten<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.820> strap<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> looks

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
tighten the little strap but it looks

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
tighten the little strap but it looks
like<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.619> pretty<00:01:37.770> secure<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.520> think

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
like it's pretty secure and I think

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
like it's pretty secure and I think
it'll<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> great<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> four<00:01:44.040> piece<00:01:44.250> set

it'll be great this is a four piece set

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
it'll be great this is a four piece set
