00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
photograph look like a sketch in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000 
photograph look like a sketch in
Photoshop<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.170> pretty<00:00:25.410> quick<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> easy

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
Photoshop so it's pretty quick and easy

Photoshop so it's pretty quick and easy
to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.580> let's<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.000> run<00:00:27.180> through<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.510> right

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to do so let's just run through it right

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
to do so let's just run through it right
now<00:00:27.840> I've<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.019> an<00:00:28.260> image<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.740> first

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
now I've got an image right here first

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.800 
now I've got an image right here first
thing<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.410> layer<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.430> by

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
copy this layer I'm going to do that by

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220 
copy this layer I'm going to do that by
dragging<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.329> down<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
dragging it right down here to this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.639 
dragging it right down here to this
second<00:00:35.010> icon<00:00:35.160> from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:36.350> making<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> copy

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
second icon from the right making a copy

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
second icon from the right making a copy
of<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.600> next<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.719> I'm

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
of it just like that next thing I'm

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.729 
of it just like that next thing I'm
going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> I've<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> make<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
going to do is I've got to make this

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
going to do is I've got to make this
black<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.250> white<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.640> we're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> click

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
black and white so we're going to click

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.549 
black and white so we're going to click
right<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.649> circle<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:45.500> go<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
right here the little circle and go to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
right here the little circle and go to
hue/saturation<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.870> an

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
hue/saturation this is going to make an

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
hue/saturation this is going to make an
adjustment<00:00:49.079> level<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.820> above<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.329> layer

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
adjustment level here above our layer

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.340 
adjustment level here above our layer
and<00:00:52.070> on<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.989> adjustment<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.110> basically

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and on this adjustment I'm basically

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.350 
and on this adjustment I'm basically
just<00:00:55.530> taking<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> saturation<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.120> zero

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
just taking the saturation down to zero

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.549 
just taking the saturation down to zero
so<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> take<00:00:58.199> away<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
so that's going to take away the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.599 
so that's going to take away the
saturation<00:00:59.250> below<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> okay<00:01:01.020> easy<00:01:01.289> enough<00:01:01.609> now

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
saturation below it okay easy enough now

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
saturation below it okay easy enough now
what<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.739> turn<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.040> part

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
what I've got to do is turn this part

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
what I've got to do is turn this part
here<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> sketch<00:01:06.990> first<00:01:07.680> thing<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
here into the sketch first thing I'm

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
here into the sketch first thing I'm
going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.790> change<00:01:09.090> blending

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
going to do is I'm gonna change blending

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.460 
going to do is I'm gonna change blending
modes<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.560> color<00:01:10.920> Dodge<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
modes to color Dodge and right there you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
modes to color Dodge and right there you
can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.920> getting<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.250> pretty<00:01:14.760> close

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
can see that's getting this pretty close

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
can see that's getting this pretty close
but<00:01:15.720> we're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> couple<00:01:16.530> more

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
but we're going to do a couple more

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
but we're going to do a couple more
steps<00:01:16.950> let<00:01:17.700> me<00:01:17.759> go<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> image

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
steps let me go up here to image

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.920 
steps let me go up here to image
adjustments<00:01:20.450> invert<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
adjustments invert now you can see it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
adjustments invert now you can see it's
really<00:01:25.680> starting<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.159> through<00:01:26.310> there

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
really starting to come through there

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.399 
really starting to come through there
but<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.450> last<00:01:27.720> change<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
but we got to make one last change and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
but we got to make one last change and
what<00:01:28.560> we're<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.280> put<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> blur<00:01:29.939> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
what we're going to do is put a blur on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
what we're going to do is put a blur on
it<00:01:30.390> filter<00:01:30.930> blur<00:01:31.700> Gaussian<00:01:32.700> blur<00:01:33.770> there<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it filter blur Gaussian blur there you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
it filter blur Gaussian blur there you
go<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.610> matter<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.880> dialing

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
go then it's just a matter of dialing

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
go then it's just a matter of dialing
this<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.049> amount<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.439> blur<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.040> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this the amount of blur you see if you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
this the amount of blur you see if you
come<00:01:38.280> too<00:01:38.460> far<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> starts<00:01:39.119> looking<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
come too far it starts looking like a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
come too far it starts looking like a
photograph<00:01:39.990> again<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.619> too<00:01:40.680> far<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
photograph again if you go too far to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
photograph again if you go too far to
the<00:01:41.220> left<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.880> can't<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.299> anything<00:01:42.479> but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the left you can't see anything but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920 
the left you can't see anything but
somewhere<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.420> find<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
somewhere in here you will find the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
somewhere in here you will find the
right<00:01:45.960> amount<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> depends<00:01:47.520> on

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
right amount and it kind of depends on

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
right amount and it kind of depends on
your<00:01:47.729> personal<00:01:48.149> preference<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.630> that's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
your personal preference but that's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
your personal preference but that's
pretty<00:01:49.049> close<00:01:49.320> somewhere<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
pretty close somewhere in there about in

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.240 
pretty close somewhere in there about in
this<00:01:50.460> particular<00:01:50.670> image<00:01:51.210> looks<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> about

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
this particular image looks like about

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
this particular image looks like about
six<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.610> great<00:01:53.790> hit<00:01:54.240> OK<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.890> there<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.040> now

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
six is great hit OK and there you go now
