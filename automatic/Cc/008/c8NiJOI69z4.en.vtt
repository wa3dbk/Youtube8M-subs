00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
first because once you start the

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.130 
first because once you start the
adventure<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.570> walk<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:18.960> out

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
adventure you can't just walk back out

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.349
