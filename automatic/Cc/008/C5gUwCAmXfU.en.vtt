00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
like that so there's a couple of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.290 
like that so there's a couple of
different<00:01:36.180> options<00:01:36.330> for<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> front

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
different options for you on the front

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.660 
different options for you on the front
our<00:01:39.300> next<00:01:39.659> step<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.380> need<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.740> close<00:01:41.430> these

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
our next step is we need to close these

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
our next step is we need to close these
gaps<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:42.840> our<00:01:43.740> mini<00:01:44.250> album<00:01:44.640> page<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:47.810> usually

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
gaps on our mini album page and usually

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
gaps on our mini album page and usually
if<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.500> were<00:01:49.620> making<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.010> box<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.729> little

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
if we were making a box there little

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.790 
if we were making a box there little
connectors<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> different<00:01:52.380> parts<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
connectors for the different parts of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.130 
connectors for the different parts of
the<00:01:52.890> box<00:01:53.159> would<00:01:53.430> fit<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.540> spots<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.080> we

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the box would fit in these spots but we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
the box would fit in these spots but we
don't<00:01:55.380> need<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.220> going<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
don't need them so we're just going to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.610 
don't need them so we're just going to
glue<00:01:56.670> them<00:01:56.820> closed

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
glue them closed

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.210 
glue them closed
so<00:01:58.620> I<00:01:58.680> will<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.100> that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.679 

it's<00:02:05.220> oppression<00:02:05.759> glue-in<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it's oppression glue-in if you like to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
it's oppression glue-in if you like to
lose<00:02:06.900> your<00:02:06.960> hot<00:02:07.439> glue<00:02:07.590> gun<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.369> use

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
lose your hot glue gun here you can use

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.850 
lose your hot glue gun here you can use
it<00:02:08.700> would<00:02:09.630> work<00:02:09.810> perfect<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:12.709> okay<00:02:13.709> now

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it would work perfect here okay now

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.979 
it would work perfect here okay now

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.229 
we've glued all three sides and then
along<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> top<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.580> need<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.849> make<00:02:18.000> sure<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239

another<00:06:40.239> set<00:06:40.479> of<00:06:40.599> covers<00:06:41.579> but<00:06:42.579> because<00:06:42.969> the

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:43.179 
another set of covers but because the

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:45.569 
another set of covers but because the
binding<00:06:43.419> at<00:06:43.689> all<00:06:43.839> is<00:06:44.110> inside<00:06:44.319> the<00:06:44.799> cover<00:06:45.099> I<00:06:45.249> had

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:49.319 
binding at all is inside the cover I had
to<00:06:45.759> allow<00:06:46.029> extra<00:06:47.129> chipboard<00:06:48.129> for<00:06:48.999> the<00:06:49.089> cover

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:49.329 
to allow extra chipboard for the cover

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.419 
to allow extra chipboard for the cover
let<00:06:50.169> me<00:06:50.289> just<00:06:50.469> flip<00:06:50.649> to<00:06:50.709> the<00:06:50.860> back<00:06:50.949> here<00:06:51.369> and

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:51.429 
let me just flip to the back here and

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:53.969
