00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.830
 coup is mum we thought because 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 a baby already a bit 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 Prepare for a baby food 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 challenge and right family are here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.200
 six different varieties like the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 Forgotten food of course masked 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 just there was just tack tack tack 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 taken from shelf and bought and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.230
 so our region is not the color 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.390
 be distracted 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'm with her. I want the green one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:12.500
 glasses I now do not know me 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.500
 that is still born 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 then you get your oldest euro that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.679
 thing really is something I think 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.679
 also made warm 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.070
 ww is food is only it is on everyone 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.610
 do something with spinach and potatoes 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
 and spinach 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.450
 I would like to be such 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.060
 but it starts and tastes like that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 After cardboard I say that with guaranteed 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.080
 if it is new commodity and still 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 a bit of salt and pepper said so 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.850
 do you want to 1 1 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 ok then I do now every time when so 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 Something I think I'm doing 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.239
 We have to teach tomatis to teach 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.050
 then you see that we totally 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.050
 ruined 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.240
 I think that tastes good 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.349
 I'm pretty good from what I do not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.810

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.549

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.460

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.010
 if you could do it a bit 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:05:22.140
 You could be soaked cardboard 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:28.290
 Do not move it but not potato 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:32.210

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.210
