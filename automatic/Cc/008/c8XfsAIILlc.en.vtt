00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to compare them against each other so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
to compare them against each other so
these<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.870> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.320> same<00:01:25.560> brush<00:01:25.920> even

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
these are kind of the same brush even

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
these are kind of the same brush even
though<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.820> different<00:01:27.150> names<00:01:27.330> which

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
though they have different names which

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
though they have different names which
didn't<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.230> sense<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.100> one

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
didn't really make sense to me the one

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
didn't really make sense to me the one
the<00:01:29.400> white<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.420> professional

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the white one is the professional

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
the white one is the professional
eyeshadow<00:01:31.890> brush<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.970> black<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
eyeshadow brush and the black one is the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.650 
eyeshadow brush and the black one is the
eyeshadow<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.500> brush<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.760> like<00:01:36.480> this

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
eyeshadow see brush and I like this

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.560 
eyeshadow see brush and I like this
three-dollar<00:01:37.080> one<00:01:37.440> way<00:01:37.800> better<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:39.330> only

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
three-dollar one way better and for only

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
three-dollar one way better and for only
two<00:01:39.900> dollars<00:01:40.260> more<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:40.980> worth<00:01:41.190> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
two dollars more I think it's worth it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.190 
two dollars more I think it's worth it
to<00:01:41.430> spend<00:01:41.730> like<00:01:42.000> two<00:01:42.180> dollars<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to spend like two dollars more to get a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.890 
to spend like two dollars more to get a
better<00:01:43.440> brush<00:01:43.830> as<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.690> white

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
better brush as you can see the white

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.710 
better brush as you can see the white
one<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.370> lot<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.420> shorter

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
one actually has like a lot of a shorter

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.820 
one actually has like a lot of a shorter
handle<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.170> I'll<00:01:49.260> hold<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> over<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
handle here I'll hold it over here so

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.680

you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.610> white<00:01:50.970> ones<00:01:51.210> handle<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
you can see the white ones handle this

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.110 
you can see the white ones handle this
really<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.800> short<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.760> didn't

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
really really really short and I didn't

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.060 
really really really short and I didn't
really<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.470> bristles<00:01:55.950> as

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
really like that and the bristles as

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270 
really like that and the bristles as
well<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.640> very<00:01:57.390> they're<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.770> even

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
well are very they're not really even

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.400 
well are very they're not really even
and<00:01:59.640> they're<00:01:59.760> not<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.300> fluffy<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.080> like<00:02:01.260> my

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
and they're not as fluffy and I like my

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.990 
and they're not as fluffy and I like my
brushes<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.860> paint<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.250> slushy<00:02:02.550> eggs<00:02:02.790> but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
brushes to paint really slushy eggs but

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
brushes to paint really slushy eggs but
fluffy<00:02:03.620> especially<00:02:04.620> when<00:02:04.830> i'm<00:02:05.070> applying

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
fluffy especially when i'm applying

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
fluffy especially when i'm applying
eyeshadow<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.120> lid<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.600> didn't<00:02:06.840> really

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
eyeshadow to the lid so I didn't really

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.259 
eyeshadow to the lid so I didn't really
like<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.620> white<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.039> too<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> really

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
like the white one too much but I really

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.660 
like the white one too much but I really
like<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.750> black<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.349> um<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.340> really

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like this black one um it's a really

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
like this black one um it's a really
good<00:02:11.849> quality<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> three<00:02:12.870> dollar<00:02:13.019> brush

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
good quality for a three dollar brush

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.410 
good quality for a three dollar brush
and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:13.950> definitely<00:02:14.280> impressed<00:02:14.700> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and I was definitely impressed it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.010 
and I was definitely impressed it's
really<00:02:15.630> fluffy

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
really fluffy

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.140 
really fluffy
I<00:02:17.050> really<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.190> fact<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.970> has<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
I really like the fact that it has a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.660 
I really like the fact that it has a
really<00:02:19.390> long<00:02:19.630> handle<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.290> for<00:02:20.830> three<00:02:21.550> dollars

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
really long handle and for three dollars

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
really long handle and for three dollars
you<00:02:21.940> can't<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.270> beat<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.020> would

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
you can't really beat that but I would

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.900 
you can't really beat that but I would
not<00:02:23.380> recommend<00:02:23.530> buying<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.430> dollar<00:02:24.610> one

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
not recommend buying the one dollar one

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.530 
not recommend buying the one dollar one
and<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:27.520> didn't<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:28.240> seem

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and that one I just didn't really seem

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.570 
and that one I just didn't really seem
worth<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.170> me<00:02:29.290> alright<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.460> we're

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
worth it to me alright and then we're

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760 
worth it to me alright and then we're
going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> move<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.270> KY<00:02:32.050> guess<00:02:32.320> kind<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
going to move on to KY guess kind of a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.300 
going to move on to KY guess kind of a
crease<00:02:33.100> brush<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:34.410> here's<00:02:35.410> I'll<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
crease brush and here's I'll put the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.450 
crease brush and here's I'll put the
white<00:02:36.490> one<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.570> same<00:02:37.750> side<00:02:37.990> again<00:02:38.460> as

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
white one on the same side again as

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.740 
white one on the same side again as
before<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.060> these<00:02:40.120> are<00:02:40.180> kind<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.540> same

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
before and these are kind of the same

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.030 
before and these are kind of the same
brush<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.380> can<00:02:41.530> definitely<00:02:41.710> see<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
brush but you can definitely see a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.310 
brush but you can definitely see a
distinct<00:02:42.580> difference<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.510> white<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
distinct difference so white one is a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.830 
distinct difference so white one is a
contour<00:02:45.220> brush<00:02:45.400> which<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.850> basically<00:02:46.330> means

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
contour brush which is basically means

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.420 
contour brush which is basically means
that<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:48.330> used<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.660> put<00:02:50.050> eyeshadow<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that it is used to put eyeshadow in the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
that it is used to put eyeshadow in the
crease<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.150> said<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.930> one<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> black

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
crease like I said and the one the black

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.650 
crease like I said and the one the black
is<00:02:53.590> also<00:02:53.920> called<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> contour<00:02:54.940> brush<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.630> I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
is also called the contour brush so I

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
is also called the contour brush so I
decided<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.200> buy<00:02:56.530> both<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.130> compare<00:02:57.160> them<00:02:57.730> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
decided to buy both and compare them and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.580 
decided to buy both and compare them and
tell<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:58.240> thought<00:02:58.450> once<00:02:59.260> again<00:02:59.560> I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
tell you what I thought once again I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
tell you what I thought once again I
thought<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> three<00:03:00.340> dollar<00:03:00.520> one<00:03:00.820> was<00:03:01.030> way

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
thought the three dollar one was way

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.410 
thought the three dollar one was way
better<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:02.470> they're<00:03:02.920> more<00:03:03.280> even<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.180> you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
better this they're more even so you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.730 
better this they're more even so you
could<00:03:04.690> get<00:03:04.870> away<00:03:05.020> with<00:03:05.110> buying<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.590> one

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
could get away with buying the one

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.650 
could get away with buying the one
dollar<00:03:05.950> one<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.400> being<00:03:06.670> really<00:03:07.180> satisfied

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
dollar one and being really satisfied

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.690 
dollar one and being really satisfied
with<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.440> only<00:03:08.650> thing<00:03:08.740> i<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.670> better

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
with it but the only thing i like better

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.570 
with it but the only thing i like better
about<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.330> black<00:03:10.540> one<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.950> part<00:03:12.340> if

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
about the black one is that this part if

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.580 
about the black one is that this part if
you<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:13.000> see<00:03:13.180> on<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> white<00:03:13.570> one<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:14.050> not

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
you can see on the white one it's not

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.770 
you can see on the white one it's not
it's<00:03:14.830> really<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:15.790> fluffy<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.630> makes

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
it's really really fluffy and that makes

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.110 
it's really really fluffy and that makes
it<00:03:16.900> really<00:03:17.140> hard<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.760> properly<00:03:18.760> place

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
it really hard to properly place

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.270 
it really hard to properly place
eyeshadow<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.930> their<00:03:20.320> correct<00:03:20.530> place<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.070> your

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
eyeshadow in their correct place on your

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.490 
eyeshadow in their correct place on your
crease<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.540> big<00:03:22.720> fan<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.990> that<00:03:23.230> but

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
crease so I was in a big fan of that but

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.870 
crease so I was in a big fan of that but
i<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.709> how<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.860> black<00:03:24.160> when<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.700> little

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
i like how the black when it's a little

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.910 
i like how the black when it's a little
bit<00:03:24.970> more<00:03:25.120> tapered<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.230> still<00:03:26.590> really

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
bit more tapered and it's still really

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.199 
bit more tapered and it's still really
fluffy<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.730> still<00:03:27.880> has<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> lot<00:03:28.150> of

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
bristles but at the same time it's

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.000 
bristles but at the same time it's
really<00:03:31.000> precise<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.750> applying<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.440> shadow

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
really precise and applying it a shadow

really precise and applying it a shadow
in<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.280> crease<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:33.790> i<00:03:33.820> did<00:03:34.120> indeed<00:03:34.870> very<00:03:35.350> much

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650

recommend botton the black one for two

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
dollars more because it's really not

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680

annoy me like they'd they have this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.770 
annoy me like they'd they have this
brush<00:03:59.650> which<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.459> defining<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.209> brush<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:01.720> you

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
brush which is a defining I brush so you

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.920 
brush which is a defining I brush so you
would<00:04:02.080> use<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.650> put<00:04:03.180> eyeshadow<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.870> the

would use this to put eyeshadow on the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.199 
would use this to put eyeshadow on the
brow<00:04:05.410> bone<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:06.100> they<00:04:06.220> didn't<00:04:06.520> have<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.910> in

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
brow bone but they didn't have this in

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.780 
brow bone but they didn't have this in
the<00:04:07.630> elf<00:04:08.050> studio<00:04:08.530> line<00:04:08.890> which<00:04:09.100> is<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.459> three

the elf studio line which is the three
dollar<00:04:10.000> line<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.080> thought<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.380> was

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
dollar line and I thought that was

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.870 
dollar line and I thought that was
really<00:04:11.680> annoying<00:04:11.980> because<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.520> a<00:04:12.550> decent

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
really annoying because this is a decent

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.610 
really annoying because this is a decent
brush<00:04:13.300> but<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.600> would<00:04:13.810> really<00:04:13.989> like<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.380> see

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
brush but I would really like to see

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.229 
brush but I would really like to see
their<00:04:14.920> brush<00:04:15.190> from<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.580> three<00:04:15.790> dollar<00:04:15.970> line

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
their brush from the three dollar line

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.010 
their brush from the three dollar line
because<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.540> would<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.840> definitely

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
because I would have definitely

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.580 
because I would have definitely
purchased<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.770> if<00:04:17.980> they<00:04:18.220> had<00:04:18.489> had<00:04:18.520> it<00:04:19.140> but<00:04:20.140> yeah

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
purchased it if they had had it but yeah

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.370 
purchased it if they had had it but yeah
this<00:04:20.739> brush<00:04:20.980> is<00:04:21.010> ok<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.459> mean<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.540> not<00:04:23.110> really

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
this brush is ok I mean it's not really

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.740 
this brush is ok I mean it's not really
a<00:04:23.500> big<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.830> deal<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.130> put<00:04:24.640> eyeshadow<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.510> your

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
a big of a deal to put eyeshadow on your

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.900 
a big of a deal to put eyeshadow on your
brow<00:04:25.930> bone<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.800> mean<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.250> brush<00:04:27.520> does<00:04:27.729> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
brow bone so I mean this brush does the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.460 
brow bone so I mean this brush does the
job<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.510> for<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.660> dollar<00:04:28.870> like<00:04:29.169> you<00:04:29.290> can't

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
job and for a dollar like you can't

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.550 
job and for a dollar like you can't
really<00:04:29.710> beat<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.040> so<00:04:30.280> I

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
really beat that so I

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.909 
really beat that so I
suggest<00:04:30.950> buying<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:33.590> brush

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
suggest buying that one and this brush

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.220 
suggest buying that one and this brush
is<00:04:34.100> an<00:04:34.280> angled<00:04:34.639> brush<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.270> would<00:04:35.419> use<00:04:35.990> this

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
is an angled brush and I would use this

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.500 
is an angled brush and I would use this
to<00:04:36.590> fill<00:04:36.830> in<00:04:36.950> my<00:04:37.070> eyebrows<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.360> it

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.440 
will make is they make them really big
and<00:04:51.950> bushy<00:04:52.160> sometimes<00:04:52.700> because<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.090> brush<00:04:53.300> is

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
and bushy sometimes because the brush is

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.629 
and bushy sometimes because the brush is
cubic<00:04:53.780> this<00:04:53.960> kind<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.650> solves<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.580> problem

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
cubic this kind of solves that problem

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.590 
cubic this kind of solves that problem
because<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.510> like<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.530> small<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:59.300> all

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
because it is like so small and it's all

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.110 
because it is like so small and it's all
the<00:04:59.780> Brussels<00:05:00.169> are<00:05:00.290> really<00:05:00.800> compact<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:02.000> it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the Brussels are really compact so it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.700
