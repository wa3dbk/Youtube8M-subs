00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:26.985
I'm Alex Rigan, president of the Association.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.119
Good evening, I'm the director, Pierre Louis Felix

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:38.517
Good evening HaitiXhange, my name is Saint-Juste Naissance, the association advisor. I'm here to give all the guys advice.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:43.411
How did this association start?

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:54.447
This was how we started. While I was in communications school, I met a professor named Jack Maurus.

00:00:55.038 --> 00:01:03.480
He told me I had to write a screenplay. Since I had a story, I turned it into a screenplay.

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:14.325
Then I asked him about promotions, and he told me that to get the word out I would need an association. This was why I started this association.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:18.598
What projects have you already worked on?

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:24.061
Our first project was "Anneau du Ciecle", which failed because of the earthquake. 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:33.602
Afterwards we weren't discouraged because we had a very well determined objective, and I surrounded myself with the people you see here, and we did "Fixation".

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:38.205
Explain the plot of the film "Fixation".

00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:51.025
Yes I wrote it. I can say it is my story, because it's something I experienced. Two young people growing up in a neighborhood. But their families are different. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.337
One comes from a lower class, and the other one comes from a class that is a little higher. 

00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:10.235
But they have come to love each other, but the girl's mother does not accept the young man because of his terrible situation.

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:16.562
After a while the young man does not let life discourage him since he has a well planned objective. 

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:22.878
I think that even the name of the film explains that it is a 'Fixation'. It is the objective of the person. What they are 'fixated' with in life.

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.835
Can you give us a little scene?

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:32.633
I'll give you a scene with two people to see what kind of performances they give.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:36.343
Good evening, Bernard Marie Beatrice.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:41.683
Good evening HaitiXchange, my name is Cadet Lensey and I'm a member of the association.

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:44.183
Action

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:52.298
You've asked me to come here, you know I can't stay too long. So tell me what's important so I can leave, because you know I've been grounded.

00:02:54.399 --> 00:03:02.392
The reason I've asked you here, is to explain something to you that has been tormenting me. 

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:16.062
The life that would like, if you're not in it, it won't come true. Also, I'm ready to sacrifice everything. Even do the impossible, to have you.

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:17.885
Can I.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.691
Can you what?

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:22.352
Can I get a...

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.176
Get what?

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.112
A kiss? Something I dream of often.

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:31.435
No problem.

00:03:33.064 --> 00:03:34.439
No problem? - No.

00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:35.751
After what you've told me...

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:50.652
The kiss was really sweet.

00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:03.759
Good evening, Occenat Franzy, spokesperson.

00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:09.048
Good evening, I'm Osias Maxel, vice president of AAH and the Best Film Production.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.913
My name is Viana Edward Carlo, and it's been my dream since I was very little to become an actress 

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:22.366
because my dream was to became an actress just like all the actresses I see on TV, like Angelina Jolie, Jenifer Lopez.

00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:33.440
When someone plays a role in a film, you have to get into the skin of the person you are playing, to do it well. For example Mr. Rigan gave me the part of a crazy person. 

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:39.033
I have to get into the skin of a crazy person, for example, I sometimes see crazy people in the streets.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.081
I have to get into the skin of the character I am playing in order to do it well.

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.884
Give me a little 'crazy person' really quickly.

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.629
Want me to stand up?

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.446
Look!

00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:20.816
You' really crazy!

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.651
My name is Luma Andy Fedler, treasurer.

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:33.789
Good evening HaitiXchange, I'm Petit Frere James, a member of the association.

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:38.223
Good evening, my name is Point-du-Jour Marcony, association treasurer.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:42.247
Good evening. I am Camille Kensley Junior, a young actor.

00:05:42.524 --> 00:05:47.601
What criticism do we have for Haitian cinema in general?

00:05:47.896 --> 00:06:02.162
What I can say about Haitian cinema, there is a sort of laziness. We in AAH want this to change. We want to come with something else so that Haitian cinema can go farther. 

00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:12.199
Because, when you watch successful African movies, there isn't a very big difference. The way they act is not that different from us. 

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:16.360
We lack work [ethic]. I think we can reach this level.

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:23.502
Cinema is a profession. There are principles to respect. Haitians don't usually respect the principles. 

00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:33.737
For instance, when you take a young actor or actress in a scene, when you watch it, if you know cinema, you see that they are reciting their lines. In cinema there is no reciting.

00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:48.483
We want to thank HaitiXchange. We want to thank everyone who will watch this, and who will comment. This is what will allow us to advance. We like that. Thanks HaitiXchange.
