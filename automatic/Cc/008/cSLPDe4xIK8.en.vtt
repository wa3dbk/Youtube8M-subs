color theory comes in

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
color theory comes in
so<00:00:55.860> especially<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.489> Indian<00:00:56.940> skin<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> Asian

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
a blue tone to them so you need to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
a blue tone to them so you need to
cancel<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> blue<00:01:03.690> tone<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.379> order

cancel out that blue tone and in order

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.230 
cancel out that blue tone and in order
to<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.339> need<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.970> orange
