take her to the park the Disney park I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
take her to the park the Disney park I
think<00:01:12.990> she<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:13.950> easier

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think she would be a little bit easier

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850 
think she would be a little bit easier
to<00:01:14.310> carry<00:01:14.670> around<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.570> she<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> nice

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
to carry around so she does have a nice

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
to carry around so she does have a nice
full<00:01:17.340> head<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> hair<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> really

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
full head of hair it's in a really

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.219 
full head of hair it's in a really
pretty<00:01:19.670> really<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.850> pony<00:01:21.420> tail<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.780> her

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
pretty really pretty pony tail and her
bangs<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.070> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.400> swept<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> tucked

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
underneath her crown which is I guess

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
underneath her crown which is I guess
this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> tiara<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.439> she's<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this is a tiara because she's just a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.899 
this is a tiara because she's just a
little<00:01:29.970> toddler<00:01:30.390> princess<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
little toddler princess so I like that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
little toddler princess so I like that
it's<00:01:33.210> held<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.110> keep<00:01:34.439> it

that<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.380> will<00:02:57.620> say<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:58.610> they<00:02:58.940> should

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
that I will say is I think they should

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360 
that I will say is I think they should
have<00:02:59.209> put<00:02:59.390> maybe<00:03:00.350> some<00:03:00.470> really<00:03:00.860> pretty<00:03:01.010> tulle

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
have put maybe some really pretty tulle

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.979 
have put maybe some really pretty tulle
underneath<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.510> make<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.810> look<00:03:02.959> a

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
underneath to kind of make it look a

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.780 
underneath to kind of make it look a
little<00:03:03.230> bit<00:03:03.500> more<00:03:03.680> full<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.160> think<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.670> would

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
little bit more full I think that would

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.059 
little bit more full I think that would
have<00:03:04.880> been<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.390> pretty<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.650> guess<00:03:06.830> she

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
have been really pretty but I guess she

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.789 
have been really pretty but I guess she
is<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> toddler<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.170> does<00:03:09.170> she<00:03:09.350> really<00:03:09.440> need<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
is a toddler so does she really need to

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.550 
is a toddler so does she really need to
have<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.010> full<00:03:10.489> skirt<00:03:10.760> probably<00:03:11.330> not<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:12.350> just

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
have a full skirt probably not I just

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.630 
have a full skirt probably not I just
think<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.980> would<00:03:13.069> have<00:03:13.190> been<00:03:13.280> really<00:03:13.459> pretty

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
think it would have been really pretty

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.870 
think it would have been really pretty
