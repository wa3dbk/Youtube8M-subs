00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Portuguese technology is being 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.480
 disputed for the whole world 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.610
 are machines that make the identification 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 the individual biometric data in the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.550
 airports 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.700
 the reporter paula cardona I got to know 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.440
 this national company arrived at the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660
 miami airport united states 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 They found a control port 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.789
 Automatic passengers and almost this is 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.019
 to know that it is made in portugal to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 tourist brics are from a company 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.210
 Portuguese was established in 2001 is one of the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.399
 pilots of a notorious investigation and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 emerged following some 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.559
 We have initial involvements in the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.710
 legal laboratory connected to the project 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.309
 computer vision with the ordinances 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 published in 2001 and noise related to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 digital surveillance functions and then 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 fairly connected but there are solutions 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 biometric company started by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.020
 use of a system for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 identify biometric data on the card 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.230
 of the citizen 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 but the launch campaign took place 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.520
 with the installation of the control system 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 borders at Portuguese airports 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.439
 I had the time and popularize the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.220
 use of the control system 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.020
 borders 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.799
 are these themes have been installed in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.290
 airports all over the world new and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 systems with your features up to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.549
 So it 's also possible to talk to her. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.150
 hear electronic document 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.619
 common global standard identification 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.299
 as is the case at this time of the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.700
 electronic passport started in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 portugal but is currently virgin box 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 exports more than one state produced the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 first potential future uk 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.880
 brought port manchester in 2009 in 2003 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.399
 that 50% for example is this year we will put 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 scent and others in the schengen area 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.960
 they are full we have more or less 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 30 per cent of the market share in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 england was in portugal in the netherlands 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 finland also story in the anthony 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.710
 do not taste 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.380
 especially in the environment here is 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 a big morning project that they charge at 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 market in terms of duration where we will 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.710
 have the largest installation systems 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.390
 border 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.300
 christened this extension of technology 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.830
 innovative national lead to the search for 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.540
 new talents 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.010
 Portugal has many valuable resources in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.740
 terms of gender and software 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.130
 unfortunately to a vacancy that I left the 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.230
 country we try to be a retention of this 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.209
 talent is a virgin box has machines 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 installed at 30 was the door and 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.220
 International around the world 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.360
 border control did not approve 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
 also has the help of this new 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.780
 technology with electronic passports 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.360
 machines make the recognition 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.660
 of passengers 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.040
 Let's see how matches work. 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.250
 between portela airport charges 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.250
 in lisbon not this option of discs 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.989
 border control 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.060
 a series of machines as inputs 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.340
 this makes the boundary line using 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.380
 easy versus electronic much more 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.480
 fast and even for who is and who has 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.310
 than catching a plane high on the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.840
 always more practical and in the states 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.239
 United States have implemented this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.280
 service I think there is little time for 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.190
 also for oxy gandhi is of the states 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.230
 united and thinks it is is with his mother and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.160
 I think they should have opted at the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.470
 technological progress as a very good and 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.540
 there missing little less time to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.640
 without automatic doors in the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.980
 Portuguese airports including the Azores 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.110
 and wood the number of fans of the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.530
 passport is increasing 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.510
 this year we have had an average 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.370
 exceeds 120 thousand 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
 we are counting to exceed one million 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.230
 and half transactions at the end of the year being 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.640
 that at Lisbon airport alone the number is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.380
 more than 70 thousand 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480
 the machines do security control 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.070
 is through the identification of the data 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.109
 individual biometric 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.780
 we have a system that works then 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.140
 space the first step is in fact is 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.000
 exception of the passport in the reader where 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.549
 voter will check the moments 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.010
 curious passport after the first 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.709
 door and the person entering the interior 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.810
 for the second phase the second phase is the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.980
 choice of live photography is still 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.290
 supervision in a 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.849
 the exterior by the astonishing that 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.319
 oversees four to five years 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.269
 therefore it is a system of fact 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.100
 extremely secure identification of 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.739
 biometric data allows you to detect 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.479
 fraud or other forms of 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.570
 Portugal and also in other countries that 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.449
 already have similar systems is the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.620
 that we do is that the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.110
 people using documents 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.530
 fraudulent is prefer the boxes 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.139
 that is, they rely more on 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.660
 possibility of success before the eye 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.610
 for the inspector than using 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.590
 the machines and therefore the number of 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.289
 frauds detected on machines and 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.510
 greatly reduced the system 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.330
 automatic border control and 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.000
 to pour citizens of the European union 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.039
 more than 18 years 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.380
 is a new technology in the control of 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.650
 borders a Portuguese system with a 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.120
 innovative technology already existed systems 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.979
 automatic border control 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.410
 airports but they do not oblige 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.979
 pre-registration and wanted to test the speed 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.979
 of the new system 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.180
 to say that in a yellow zone it enters 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.230
 the biometric data have already been 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.080
 identified 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.660
 control is done and now it's just 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.410
 take the plane to Pedro's house and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.410
 go to rtp
