00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.830
 hey i'm max and block and show you 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.629
 how you can jailbreak 16:13 as 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.369
 the very first one connects the first device 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.160
 that's what the computer once is 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:19.070
 white usb cable to the computer and the 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.750
 other end of the iphone or ipod 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.260
 if you did that, go back up 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.730
 the desktop and invite you redsnow and 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.400
 16.0 depending on which one 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.530
 device is needed if you need it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.280
 you could have the ios 6.0 etter 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.749
 push away and brad still start too 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.210
 save we go first 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:43.519
 extras there then on select ips da video 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.789
 that's very important here you have 6.0 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.829
 look even if you have the 6,138 otherwise 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.059
 it works with us after all 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.370
 you have to make the jailbreak 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.940
 once new nose fits well there must 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.190
 now even go extra biopic now 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.179
 we just let that jailbreak on 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.179
 go through it all 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.570
 so if that's then must 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.850
 simply nothing click and short weapons 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.409
 Here we have to then our device simply 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.030
 switch off for a short while, that works 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.340
 comes easy to keep their expensive 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.770
 upper pressed until the red slider 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.390
 come and put him on huber 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.909
 if you did that then made shows red 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.750
 nor a guide to the murder of so how 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.130
 the whole thing is happening to me here 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.409
 Do not play next and I have to go in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.180
 hold down the upper button and that 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.530
 whole has the instruction after when you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.940
 then you have to do it 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.920
 Doing nothing more rats then runs 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 automatically more alone through the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.640
 the most important thing is just yet 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.800
 men at the end so if then then stands 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.899
 the offense reboots wants the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.770
 I'll reboot all over again 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.300
 simply good before click extras just the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.270
 you have to do the 6.0 again 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.590
 Select that is very important and now 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.420
 Let's get back to the device 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.840
 and I show you the patchwork 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.390
 my iphone 4 has worked 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.200
 arrived on the iphone the suits on the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.729
 next page 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.380
 I show did exactly the same again 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.899

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.489
 and 13 is but now I say so
