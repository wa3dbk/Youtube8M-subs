00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.560
 then we guys got to the end 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 of the year and therefore it is my task 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 assign you vacation tasks 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.830
 yes sure boy is not there to do 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.260
 noises started doing nothing I know 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.720
 however we must keep in mind in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.600
 these two months of vacation so it's mine 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.689
 task to assign you tasks 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.550
 ok well first of all I state it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.649
 basically wanted to have them de col 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.750
 I advise you therefore not to break the and the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 others will have their homework 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.789
 then let's start immediately some of you is 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.989
 a book or sebastiano thanks quilibrio 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.090
 at the boys we start immediately with things 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 simple things fast then the page 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 309 the number 1 2 3 4 5 6 the 7 lo 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.969
 we exclude because it is very difficult 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.070
 then why the boys told us what 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 it's nothing simple than the page with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 170 we do the 205 206 up to the 222 e 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 then from 120 to 715 thousand people all over 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.880
 the math jury all the same 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.479
 boys that is the fact that they pass if 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.729
 no must see this mathematics and for 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 the rest seems to me to have appeared ie boys 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.380
 everything is fine 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 now not with which I do my things 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 I take the whole thing with unsuspecting jones e 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.009
 prince of persia cover the sands of the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.189
 time 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.259
 hello guys happy holidays to all 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.450
 then after this brief intro we talk 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 pre-school clean 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 well yes it is a very strange time 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 muddler 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.970
 there is a lot of hot holidays ends 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.880
 that the nation emerges more 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.350
 really a mess but above all to the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 what worries me most are i 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.130
 parents that is parents but they are like that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.880
 thesis that school is starting 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 they start screaming to be my baby 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.780
 do not shave the case at first 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.310
 love is really a little time 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.080
 so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.000
 but now let's do it calmly start at 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 speak first to buy the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 holidays during this period therefore of 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.500
 three months long vacation we have everything 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.260
 the right to have fun doing what 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.450
 it is worth it therefore concludes holidays there 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.720
 we care we slam the 90 per 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.270
 one hundred per cent find again at the end of August 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.920
 in September then 20 to make one 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.590
 problematic bending then of 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.209
 professors, if ever, tell those promoted 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.500
 ok enough that I took steps I don't see 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.150
 nothing but enough that in fact more 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.280
 bassino you read some leeches books 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.620
 he understood but it is not that you assign eight 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.790
 books to read so happy for 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 get this result 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.209
 at school we would come back with a lot 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.630
 serenity would no longer be said 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.420
 professor goes the shit asshole and then there 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.030
 parents are also brought one morning 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.790
 suddenly the peer wakes us up 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.940
 he comes down from his bed and wears 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940
 glasses 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.030
 and with making menacing initiates 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:35.290
 we die but how are they put with it 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:38.700
 I study studio but you are sure yes yes but there 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.700
 I will think I will think about it 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.790
 so with soft footing scoring in 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.050
 his room went to this point that 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.300
 to the usual fathers or to the ahmar e 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.610
 intransigent I felt like a chip with one 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.120
 red light a chemical counter of the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.070
 time spent outside the home and more you come back 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.170
 at home happy most time out 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.870
 the more I suspect you're not 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:08.070
 studying it seems to you this morning a 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.070
 that point part of the corset 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:18.340
 little mum on the coast lantern closed 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.320
 and escape from it you go out with friends but 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.419
 those normal girls 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120
 ours is finished by the time of 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.810
 have fun now the time has come 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.480
 to study 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:36.630
 you understand school because we start 9 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:40.240
 what they all have details 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.540
 free to me in 14 days when 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.500
 school will start these are the exits 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.940
 is allowed but then with the heat it does 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.940
 seems to be a circle of hell 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:59.700
 those damned are sitting and stuck 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.289
 from the same tudor and a chair I come 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.669
 constantly tease by 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:13.449
 in total and are obliged to transcribe 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:18.639
 and praise the name dead languages books of 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.919
 English as big as the sofia 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.210
 elementary 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.369
 then those professors come to you 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.009
 they launch moralistic bricks concerning 

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:30.490
 love brings it 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:34.059
 friendship the engines of the family 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.219
 in short, one day they told me 31 must 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.839
 be a pleasure I will not have to cherish 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:43.930
 professor why not vip to read i 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:45.360
 my bricks and mine of bricks and 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.959
 not yours 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.959
 finally the dream I would like to temper 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.959

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.639
