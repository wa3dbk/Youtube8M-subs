 and I like it I can boast one but 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.089
 it's a gameplay like I was offered 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 and frankly I think it's great 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.140
 be it as a massacre 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.460

 sweet silent so I count I you 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.120
 tell lies that have already proposed 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.649
 of gameplay to two big chains 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.110
 community maybe the two most 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.550
 major French community channels 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.170
 of call of duty which are side qg 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.960
 cf code you will have noticed with their 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.949
 antrum at the beginning and the water to the east and I 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.300
 go during this bee-eater I make you a 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.260
 gunnar story I remember for those who 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.910
 do not know what a story is 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.620
 gun this is my new fighting style and 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.570
 so I'm going to tell you the story of 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.850
 the art harel me 10h tears in-game sound 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 useful irl solicited in game with 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.759
 always small tips here or 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 to know how to use it 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.759
 we always do the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.479
 presentation so the place of my 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.610
 Dear friend 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.770
 so he plays with so as I said 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.830
 space or muffler with more weight 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.039
 conjuring trick marathon and I believe 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.819
 yes that's it featherweight marathon space 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.810
 good second there have been two 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.890
 rocket launcher you'll see he's going 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.349
 almost not used since at each 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 times he's going to switch weapons to recover 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.780
 a huge foot on the ground since as 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.459
 we know if we will do a gameplay 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 wrong pass 12 must have taken 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.300
 looters since the shotguns so 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.590
 not a lot of cartridges finally they 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.729
 have anyway in quantity but for 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.520
 to do an entire part it becomes very 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.330
 hard and suddenly that's why if 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 you want to do a whole game 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.450
 pump rifle reborn the mole read so 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.830
 this is how you see already comes from 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 finish his first series since he comes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.979
 to unlock his gunner finally it's 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.970
 the heinz I think it pits so this 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.450
 are his series it's blackburn you remind 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.310
 good base so they strictly basic for 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.420
 to make big 20 kings even if me 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.550
 I would have promised the dogs in place of the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.649
 round then and I will immediately started 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.000
 my little story gun and so he'll get 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.920
 base on space 12 so what is it 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.629
 that space 12 space 12.7 a rifle to 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.209
 Italian pump that was created by a marc 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:18.319
 frenchy in october 1979 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.560
 frenchy bah in fact they took out this 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.000
 shotgun but 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 fabre was not really accurate 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.959
 frenchy it was a weapons manufacturer 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.790
 who just came out in 1970 if 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 I am not wrong and said they are 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 to make a profit we have to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.640
 make a shotgun that's something 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.260
 special thing 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.930
 it is true that in the space of 12 he has 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.099
 really nothing special and when you 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.360
 compare that of mona reinforcement of the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.890
 Following black ops you say there is still 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.909
 a big difference is true since 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.920
 overcome a fort 2 remember 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.120
 space you been in manual so it's up to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 say that every time when you want 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.310
 pulling makes them reload the pump and the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.440
 lacrosse and was relaxed while the on 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.180
 black ops 2 we see that the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.370
 first he semi- automatic and that the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.989
 clau with the butt fell back then 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.159
 I will explain to you since there you 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.290
 will you say yeah it's black ops 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.129
 who was wrong scripts end of these 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.989
 black ops who wanted to develop it 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.370
 like that it does not really exist or 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.720
 so on the contrary put yourself no it's 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.769
 my to a burden that was wrong that's 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.560
 they who are hurt is scripted 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.459
 in short the shotgun is going twelve 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.049
 what you have to know is that it's a 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.579
 shotgun that is flexible 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.019
 that is, I think it's 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.700
 India and there is not much about 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.540
 land of freezing bridge like that who 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.500
 allow to have two cases in 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.970
 different so what to say you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.099
 can pull in textbooks like you 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.049
 can shoot in semi auto and yes it's 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.280
 true it is possible you will tell me 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.569
 but what use did we put in 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 manual if we can already challans this 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.459
 biotteau the first utility is that the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.139
 semi auto mode it is useful when you 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.310
 are in close combat you have 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.540
 need clarification here should be drawn 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.010
 as a need you shoot like a 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.319
 nag pop and ya not have to look for lunch at 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.849
 fourteen hours while manual mode 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.290
 it's not bad if you're looking for 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.449
 accuracy if you are looking for stability 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.650
 since that's it, as I said 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.560
 semi automatic word you are going to have 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.760
 many go back there I will leave 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.040
 the attention because bean games that's 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.290
 not true irl you have a lot of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.489
 back while with the manual mode already 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.410
 you will be able to hold your rifle 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.780
 pump and then and you will gain in 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.790
 accuracy so that's what makes 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
 really the spa specialty this 12c sa 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 scope since it has a maximum range 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.040
 40 m we'll tell you it's 40 meters 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.260
 all good but for a shotgun 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.169
 it's already not bad so effective door 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.970
 of 40 meters so his switch so of 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.120
 mode can be passed from manual years 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.489
 start at the early bio and I believe that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.659
 that's all so that was for 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.650
 the story of pass 12 since me there 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.130
 not much to say since it's a 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.750
 shotgun there is no 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.850
 and let's say he did not make a big 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.470
 success even if he wants today not 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.990
 arms hurt scaring of armed but of 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.130
 police use it that's where I think that 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.420
 but the Italian police and a police 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.860
 French people use pump guns 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.570
 even if he starts to get a little 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.510
 old-fashioned since he now has 30 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.910
 81 32 years soon 32 years or more 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.680
 it is true that in addition we are in 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.260
 moment of the facts in mode r it is up to you 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.750
 this is a modernization of weapons with 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.740
 the last remington that comes out short I 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.400
 can you tell more you need to know 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.830
 a little on it 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.790
 that's all you get together is that 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.710
 space 12 it's still four 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.400
 kilos and a half and 4 kilos and a half 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.170
 put in your head that a m 4 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.890
 today I give the basic principle 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.540
 elf and three pounds so 4 kilos and a half 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.100
 loader full good m4 load a full 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.240
 finger by he must make three pounds 3 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.010
 neutral like saviola it's a rifle to 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 pump that is heavy so on the games 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.520
 video you'll say in town and I 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.900
 in tighter as you look at them 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.520
 video games shotguns are 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.650
 men who have one of the souls who have 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.370
 the most mobility not truth is 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.900
 true that they are rather heavy has 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.100
 tried to run with five kilos end 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.810
 as his wife cathy your enemies under 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.270
 image tell you that it feels 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.530
 weight so here I finished for my 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.940
 small mouth story I bet you are 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.870
 does he pass in both call of 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.950
 duty in which he is present 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.590
 since it is surely present 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.020
 reinforcements from and on black ops I believe 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.460
 not being seen on a bone is also 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.100
 present on the fair 3 excuse me 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.170
 I had totally zapped - an iron 3 then 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.510
 on modern warfare 2 so as I said 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.510
 the scripts and with the butt on the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.500
 lacrosse deployed and a manual mode so 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.610
 I think it's the shotgun the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.320
 more powerful blood anna ford 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.370
 when I say the most powerful - burden 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.850
 it's the one with the most doors and 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.200
 the most damage so that's what makes 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.730
 finally I think it's not before 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.290
 more dropped but I think it's a 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.270
 shotgun that turns very easy 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.710
 of use on mw2 and I do not have 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.150
 hungry I do not want to criticize 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.770
 a weapon that is for me normal finally 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.150
 I mean space 12 this is it's a 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.990
 shotgun and it's one of the only ones to 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.190
 have a pump 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.080
 I think it's the only one on mills 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.580
 in the form of having a pump serves to 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.130
 each time obliged to repack before 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.960
 So pull that's what makes her a little 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.490
 difficulty since good on sea ​​var 2 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.410
 here you have a space 12 fallen face 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.750
 to a guy at a 10-14 of you miss your 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.310
 first cartridge haye for you in 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.780
 swiss on black so me on my effort 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.720
 of I advise you to use with 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.720
 is referred laser is a handle his 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.890
 only little anecdote for bafin 2 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.890
 and I'm going to talk about acoss instead 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.060
 so on black ops it is very advisable 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.160
 to use the silencer since it is 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.510
 the only accessory that disappointed despite 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.090
 the muffler removes the roadway seen the 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.560
 scope but well the frankly you 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.900
 see too the difference was 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.670
 that six years us in silent the 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.670
 silent will reduce the recoil 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.510
 since it already has a very strong decline and 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.560
 in addition to that right now it's just 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.520
 an impression I have the impression that the 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.800
 shot he's more grouped with the 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.270
 quiet good of course I you 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.500
 also advise to use it advised 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.510
 not solid shell game because 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.710
 there was my buddy to use ride 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.770
 pass but it's very dangerous 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.150
 since advised solid allows to have a 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.890
 group shot knowing that a shotgun 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.270
 satire sinkers so that allowed 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.920
 to have a group shot at a distance 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.970
 mean while the ounce pass 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.140
 pass is true that it is rather galley to 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.200
 use fake stick to the enemy for 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.430
 to be able to touch it so that's all 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.590
 what I had to read for use 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.400
 of space so recapitulative round of 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.110
 silent pass and that's it finally 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.600
 no excuse me aimed solid silent 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.860
 is good we have all weight advisors 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.960
 feather and marathon it's cold that his 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.300
 basic assets to make a pretty that 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.430
 massacre with a shotgun and 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.870
 so that's about this gameplay is going to end 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.460
 unfortunately there is going to be a 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.290
 lot migration so the score of the 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.390
 dominion wasserbourg 480 i believe the 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.960
 migration belote a little rage quit 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.730
 pity 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.620
 good it's still a very good gameplay so 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.660
 he is done with a score of 91 at 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.950
 1 if I remember and here I hope 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.150
