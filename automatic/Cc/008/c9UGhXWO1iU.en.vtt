00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
takes the hit three be on a big letdown

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.350 
takes the hit three be on a big letdown
the<00:04:41.950> ones<00:04:42.190> should<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:42.730> have<00:04:42.880> lost<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> game

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.409 
the Lions look for them to bounce back
here<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.639> think<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.880> world's<00:04:46.180> likely

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
here and we think the world's likely

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.940 
here and we think the world's likely
wins<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.690> one<00:04:46.870> roughly<00:04:47.080> touchdown<00:04:47.710> all

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
wins this one roughly touchdown all

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.590 
wins this one roughly touchdown all
