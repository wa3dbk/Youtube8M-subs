00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.630 

what<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> defense<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.380> parks<00:01:14.890> basically<00:01:15.430> was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
what a defense on parks basically was

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.760 
what a defense on parks basically was
Curt<00:01:15.909> long<00:01:16.090> he<00:01:16.869> did<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.049> very<00:01:17.200> good<00:01:17.320> job<00:01:17.470> with

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.010 
Curt long he did a very good job with
defending<00:01:18.220> tonight<00:01:18.520> against<00:01:18.880> mark<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:19.600> don't

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
defending tonight against mark I don't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.499 
defending tonight against mark I don't
think<00:01:20.200> we<00:01:20.320> can<00:01:20.439> really<00:01:20.830> stop<00:01:21.670> parks<00:01:22.180> but<00:01:22.420> at

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
think we can really stop parks but at

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.690 
think we can really stop parks but at
the<00:01:22.600> same<00:01:22.780> time<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.799> goal<00:01:24.009> is<00:01:24.159> really<00:01:24.310> just

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
the same time the goal is really just

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.539 
the same time the goal is really just
slowing<00:01:25.119> down<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:26.290> thought<00:01:26.470> Kurt<00:01:27.130> long<00:01:27.340> did

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
slowing down and I thought Kurt long did

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.520 
slowing down and I thought Kurt long did
a<00:01:27.610> pretty<00:01:27.789> good<00:01:27.940> job<00:01:28.000> with<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.299> tonight<00:01:28.570> with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
a pretty good job with that tonight with

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
focus on them tomorrow I don't think we

can<00:02:50.080> take<00:02:50.200> any<00:02:50.380> team<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.800> granted<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.280> don't

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
can take any team for granted I don't

think we could be overconfident so I

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.530 
think we could be overconfident so I
think<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.400> number<00:02:54.850> one<00:02:54.970> thing<00:02:55.150> for<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.360> team

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
think the number one thing for the team

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.840 
think the number one thing for the team
is<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.780> remain<00:02:56.020> humble<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:57.670> keep

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
is to remain humble and to just keep

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
is to remain humble and to just keep
focusing<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.480> on<00:02:58.540> each<00:02:58.840> individual<00:02:59.350> game
