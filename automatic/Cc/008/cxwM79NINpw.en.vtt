00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
bufflers then you can make a small size

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.880 
bufflers then you can make a small size
if<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.300> want<00:04:08.570> bigger<00:04:08.870> bockris<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.710> can

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
if you want bigger bockris and you can

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.940 
if you want bigger bockris and you can
make<00:04:10.100> bigger<00:04:10.430> balls<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.320> after<00:04:12.320> making<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
make bigger balls and after making the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.509 
make bigger balls and after making the
balls<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:14.030> need<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.540> put<00:04:14.780> finger<00:04:15.110> like<00:04:15.290> this

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
balls you need to put finger like this

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.610 
balls you need to put finger like this
so<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:17.720> way<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:19.840> Baffler<00:04:20.840> will<00:04:21.410> be

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
so in this way the Baffler will be

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.100 
so in this way the Baffler will be
baking<00:04:22.280> form<00:04:22.970> inner<00:04:23.120> side<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.750> from<00:04:23.930> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
baking form inner side and from the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.280 
baking form inner side and from the
outer<00:04:24.260> side<00:04:24.650> very<00:04:24.950> weather<00:04:25.220> very<00:04:25.790> well<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.930> I

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
outer side very weather very well so I
