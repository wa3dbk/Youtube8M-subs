consistent product quality control is
much<00:04:02.020> much<00:04:02.200> better<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:03.070> get<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> better

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
much much better so you get a better

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.880 
much much better so you get a better
price<00:04:04.000> better<00:04:04.810> product<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.440> it's<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.650> little

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
price better product and it's a little

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.570 
price better product and it's a little
more<00:04:06.040> expensive<00:04:06.280> than<00:04:06.820> China<00:04:07.390> or<00:04:07.810> Pakistan

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
more expensive than China or Pakistan

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.600 
more expensive than China or Pakistan
then<00:04:09.580> you<00:04:09.700> come<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.180> Korea<00:04:10.950> Korea<00:04:11.950> has<00:04:12.310> more

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
then you come to Korea Korea has more

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.670 
then you come to Korea Korea has more

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
comparable and that's what you have when

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.719 
comparable and that's what you have when
you<00:06:35.830> have<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:36.039> scissor<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:37.060> is<00:06:37.270> made<00:06:37.539> in<00:06:37.690> Japan

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
you have a scissor that is made in Japan

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.920 
you have a scissor that is made in Japan
that's<00:06:39.729> why<00:06:40.000> you're<00:06:40.210> paying<00:06:40.510> a<00:06:40.690> more

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
that's why you're paying a more

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.980 
that's why you're paying a more
expensive<00:06:41.260> price<00:06:41.680> by<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.610> same<00:06:43.030> token<00:06:43.330> there

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
expensive price by the same token there

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.210 
expensive price by the same token there
is<00:06:44.200> really<00:06:44.620> nothing

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
is really nothing

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
is really nothing
that<00:06:45.490> justifies<00:06:46.150> paying<00:06:46.990> over<00:06:47.560> 8<00:06:47.830> or<00:06:48.130> $900<00:06:49.060> for

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
that justifies paying over 8 or $900 for

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
a scissor there is there are not enough

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
a scissor there is there are not enough
expensive<00:06:52.720> parts<00:06:53.130> high<00:06:54.130> quality<00:06:54.640> steel<00:06:54.910> and

manufacturing<00:06:56.740> process<00:06:57.340> that<00:06:57.610> would<00:06:57.880> justify

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
manufacturing process that would justify

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.140 
manufacturing process that would justify
a<00:06:58.540> price<00:06:58.930> over<00:06:59.350> that<00:06:59.500> so<00:07:00.070> if<00:07:00.220> a<00:07:00.340> stylist<00:07:00.820> wants

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
a price over that so if a stylist wants

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.280 
a price over that so if a stylist wants
to<00:07:01.450> pay<00:07:01.660> in<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.290> 1200<00:07:02.980> to<00:07:03.190> 1500<00:07:03.580> dollar<00:07:03.970> range

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
to pay in the 1200 to 1500 dollar range

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.530 
to pay in the 1200 to 1500 dollar range
that<00:07:05.290> extra<00:07:05.710> four<00:07:05.980> five<00:07:06.340> $600<00:07:07.210> that<00:07:07.360> she's

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
that extra four five $600 that she's

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.040 
that extra four five $600 that she's
paying

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
paying

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.890 
paying
that's<00:07:08.440> for<00:07:08.710> ego<00:07:08.980> if<00:07:09.700> she<00:07:10.150> wants<00:07:10.480> to<00:07:10.510> do<00:07:10.720> that

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
that's for ego if she wants to do that

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.710 
that's for ego if she wants to do that
that's<00:07:11.470> great<00:07:11.950> but<00:07:12.760> she's<00:07:13.060> really<00:07:13.510> not

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
that's great but she's really not

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.040 
that's great but she's really not
getting<00:07:14.440> any<00:07:14.940> performance<00:07:15.940> improvement<00:07:16.690> for

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
getting any performance improvement for

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.650 
getting any performance improvement for
the<00:07:17.170> extra<00:07:17.500> money<00:07:17.650> that<00:07:17.770> she's<00:07:18.070> paying<00:07:18.340> and<00:07:18.660> I

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
the extra money that she's paying and I

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.030 
the extra money that she's paying and I
think<00:07:19.870> that's<00:07:20.020> something<00:07:20.230> that's<00:07:20.380> important

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
think that's something that's important

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.740 
think that's something that's important
for<00:07:21.190> distributors<00:07:21.730> to<00:07:21.760> really<00:07:22.270> know<00:07:22.450> and

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
for distributors to really know and

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.870 
for distributors to really know and
understand<00:07:23.230> so<00:07:23.770> that<00:07:23.800> they<00:07:24.040> can<00:07:24.250> see<00:07:24.460> what

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
understand so that they can see what

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.140 
understand so that they can see what
goes<00:07:25.240> into<00:07:25.810> the<00:07:26.140> cost<00:07:26.770> of<00:07:27.010> a<00:07:27.070> shear<00:07:27.340> so<00:07:28.000> that

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
goes into the cost of a shear so that

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.840 
goes into the cost of a shear so that
they<00:07:28.300> are<00:07:28.450> able<00:07:28.600> to<00:07:28.780> better<00:07:29.020> judge<00:07:29.490> the<00:07:30.490> value

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
they are able to better judge the value

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.700 
they are able to better judge the value
of<00:07:30.940> the<00:07:31.060> shear<00:07:31.270> when<00:07:31.690> they<00:07:31.870> then<00:07:32.080> sell<00:07:32.440> it<00:07:32.590> to<00:07:32.680> a

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
of the shear when they then sell it to a

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.000 
of the shear when they then sell it to a
stylist<00:07:33.160> thank<00:07:33.850> you
