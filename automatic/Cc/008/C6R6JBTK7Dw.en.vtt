00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.350 
more dry than with a normal foundation
so<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.950> guess<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.370> totally<00:03:23.700> dependent<00:03:24.240> on

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
so so I guess it's totally dependent on

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.810 
so so I guess it's totally dependent on
how<00:03:24.750> hydrated<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.650> skin<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.430> just<00:03:26.460> know

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
how hydrated your skin is but just know

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.510 
how hydrated your skin is but just know
that<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.270> very<00:03:27.450> very<00:03:27.690> dry<00:03:27.960> skin<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:29.010> would

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
that for a very very dry skin this would

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.520 
that for a very very dry skin this would
probably<00:03:29.850> not<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> best<00:03:30.870> because<00:03:31.350> it's

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
probably not be the best because it's

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.480 
probably not be the best because it's
all<00:03:32.570> crusted<00:03:33.570> all<00:03:33.750> over<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.650> I'm<00:03:34.980> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.310> say

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
all crusted all over so I'm going to say

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.130 
all crusted all over so I'm going to say
that<00:03:35.640> that's<00:03:35.760> probably<00:03:36.120> my<00:03:36.390> final<00:03:36.780> review<00:03:36.900> of

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
that that's probably my final review of

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.080 
that that's probably my final review of
it<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.410> love<00:03:37.680> how<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> looks<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.520> beautiful

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it I love how it looks it's a beautiful

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.210 
it I love how it looks it's a beautiful
light<00:03:39.510> tinted<00:03:39.990> moisturizer<00:03:40.440> not<00:03:40.830> too<00:03:41.040> much

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
light tinted moisturizer not too much

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.980 
light tinted moisturizer not too much
coverage<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.880> got<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.240> nice<00:03:42.510> natural

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
coverage it's got a really nice natural

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.470 
coverage it's got a really nice natural
satin<00:03:43.770> Sheen<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:45.000> definitely<00:03:45.150> not

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
satin Sheen to it but definitely not

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
satin Sheen to it but definitely not
good<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.690> those<00:03:46.020> of<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.410> with<00:03:46.620> very<00:03:47.040> dry<00:03:47.460> skin

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
good for those of you with very dry skin

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.480 
good for those of you with very dry skin
I'd<00:03:48.210> say<00:03:48.240> like<00:03:48.630> probably<00:03:48.980> normal<00:03:49.980> dry<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
I'd say like probably normal dry to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.400 
I'd say like probably normal dry to
slightly<00:03:51.210> oily<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.810> could<00:03:51.960> get<00:03:52.080> away<00:03:52.170> with

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
slightly oily you could get away with

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860 
slightly oily you could get away with
this<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.920> my<00:03:53.460> skin<00:03:53.760> right<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.780> a
