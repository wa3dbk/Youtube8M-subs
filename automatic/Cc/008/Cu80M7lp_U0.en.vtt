00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.910 
cricket team in Pakistan and the
horrific<00:04:57.390> horrific<00:04:57.780> events<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> lack<00:04:58.890> of

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
horrific horrific events and the lack of

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.370 
horrific horrific events and the lack of
security<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.670> think<00:05:00.120> Vega<00:05:00.360> makes<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.840> reasonably

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
security I think Vega makes a reasonably

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.320 
security I think Vega makes a reasonably
good<00:05:01.410> point<00:05:01.950> especially<00:05:02.310> with<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
good point especially with the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.880 
good point especially with the
Confederations<00:05:04.050> Cup<00:05:04.140> coming<00:05:04.620> up<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:04.830> year

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
and of course the even larger for a

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.200 
and of course the even larger for a
larger<00:05:07.050> scale<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.470> world<00:05:07.770> cup<00:05:08.100> coming<00:05:08.640> next
