hand traps faster I think to do I'll is
a<00:03:43.810> little<00:03:43.990> bit<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.110> an<00:03:44.230> overkill<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:44.800> you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
a little bit of an overkill because you

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.950 
a little bit of an overkill because you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
know the stack needs to play fast and

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.440 
know the stack needs to play fast and
slows<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.070> down<00:03:48.100> but<00:03:48.460> like<00:03:48.580> one<00:03:48.820> duality<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.330> to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
slows it down but like one duality is to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.880 
slows it down but like one duality is to
get<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> hand<00:03:50.080> traps<00:03:50.380> if<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.680> need
