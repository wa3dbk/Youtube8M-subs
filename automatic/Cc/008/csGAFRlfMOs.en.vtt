guys about pretty much my second
favorite<00:00:20.220> plant<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.020> that<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:22.349> newbies

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
favorite plant and that is the newbies

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.760 
favorite plant and that is the newbies
these<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.599> extra<00:00:25.079> anubius<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
these are some of the extra anubius that

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.929 
these are some of the extra anubius that
I<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.160> from<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.060> collection<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.759> like<00:00:29.759> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I have from my collection I like it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
I have from my collection I like it
because<00:00:30.089> it's<00:00:30.419> it's<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.560> easy<00:00:31.890> plant<00:00:32.400> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
because it's it's a very easy plant to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
because it's it's a very easy plant to
grow<00:00:33.260> similar<00:00:34.339> the<00:00:35.339> care<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.480> similar<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
grow similar the care is very similar to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
grow similar the care is very similar to
java<00:00:37.320> fern<00:00:38.989> very<00:00:39.989> easy<00:00:40.290> plant<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> grow<00:00:41.809> can<00:00:42.809> do

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
java fern very easy plant to grow can do

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.670 
java fern very easy plant to grow can do
very<00:00:43.289> well<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.860> low<00:00:44.070> light

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
very well in low light

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.900 
very well in low light
now<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.219> java<00:00:47.550> fern<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:50.219> very

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
now just like java fern it has a very

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
now just like java fern it has a very
thick<00:00:51.390> piece<00:00:53.149> here<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.780> called<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
thick piece here that's called the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.819 
thick piece here that's called the
rhizome<00:00:55.760> which<00:00:56.760> does<00:00:57.090> best<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
rhizome which does best if it's out of

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.639 
rhizome which does best if it's out of
the<00:00:59.129> substrate<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.870> vary<00:01:01.170> these

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the substrate I mean you can vary these

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.509 
the substrate I mean you can vary these
roots<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.510> fine<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.280> for<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.399> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
roots here but that's fine but for it to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.480 
roots here but that's fine but for it to
do<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.149> can<00:01:06.420> keep<00:01:06.660> this<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.860> huge

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
do well you can keep this this huge

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
do well you can keep this this huge
thick<00:01:08.880> piece<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.630> it's<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
thick piece you can see here it's this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
thick piece you can see here it's this
thick<00:01:13.679> piece<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> rise<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:17.580> keep<00:01:17.849> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
thick piece the rise them you keep it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.350 
thick piece the rise them you keep it
out<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> substrate<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.940> new<00:01:21.119> vyas

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
out of the substrate now the new vyas

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
out of the substrate now the new vyas
you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.349> can<00:01:22.500> tie<00:01:22.679> it<00:01:22.709> to<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> piece<00:01:23.190> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you can you can tie it to a piece of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.669 
you can you can tie it to a piece of
rock<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:24.420> tied<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.899> piece<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.319> driftwood

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
rock you're tied to a piece of driftwood

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.529 
rock you're tied to a piece of driftwood
it<00:01:26.099> looks<00:01:26.940> good<00:01:27.179> like<00:01:27.239> that<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.399> eventually

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
it looks good like that and eventually

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.999 
it looks good like that and eventually
these<00:01:30.539> little<00:01:30.840> roots<00:01:31.050> here<00:01:31.319> will<00:01:31.649> attach<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
these little roots here will attach to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.279 
these little roots here will attach to
the<00:01:32.429> rock<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.910> driftwood<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:37.140> got

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
the rock or the driftwood and you got

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.930 
the rock or the driftwood and you got
yourself<00:01:37.709> a<00:01:37.800> nice<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.280> piece<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.849> your

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940

to grow guys and I think it's one of the
first<00:02:32.230> plants<00:02:32.500> I've<00:02:32.740> got<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.280> my<00:02:33.790> tank<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.990> I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
first plants I've got in my tank and I
