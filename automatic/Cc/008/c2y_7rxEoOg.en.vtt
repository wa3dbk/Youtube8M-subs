00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
get right into it first of all I sort of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.060 
get right into it first of all I sort of
let<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.110> know<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.410> these<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.709> come<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:18.040> a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
let you know that these do come with a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.070

set<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.400> yellow<00:03:18.670> laces<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:19.870> switch

set of yellow laces that you can switch

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.930 
set of yellow laces that you can switch
out<00:03:20.260> personally<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.310> don't<00:03:21.370> think<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.700> probably

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
out personally I don't think I probably

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.150 
out personally I don't think I probably
will<00:03:22.330> be<00:03:22.480> doing<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.080> like<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.890> pop<00:03:24.130> that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
will be doing this I like the pop that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.530 
will be doing this I like the pop that
the<00:03:24.430> colorway<00:03:24.700> has<00:03:24.850> now<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.180> don't<00:03:25.239> want<00:03:25.450> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the colorway has now and I don't want to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.680 
the colorway has now and I don't want to
push<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.350> over<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.590> top<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:28.060> could<00:03:28.299> see<00:03:28.600> it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
push it over the top I could see it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.880 
push it over the top I could see it
being<00:03:28.720> kind<00:03:29.049> of<00:03:29.110> nice<00:03:29.260> though<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.709> for<00:03:29.830> the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
being kind of nice though just for the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.800 
being kind of nice though just for the
fact<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.400> tongue<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.790> blue<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.269> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
fact that the tongue is blue and the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.390 
fact that the tongue is blue and the
laces<00:03:32.110> are<00:03:32.230> blue<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> yellow<00:03:32.860> laces<00:03:33.130> would

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
laces are blue so the yellow laces would

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
laces are blue so the yellow laces would
add<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> little<00:03:33.760> bit<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.000> contrast<00:03:34.660> there<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.560> I

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
add a little bit of contrast there but I

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.020 
add a little bit of contrast there but I
just<00:03:35.769> for<00:03:35.950> me<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.160> really<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> look<00:03:36.910> of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
just for me I really like the look of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.520 
just for me I really like the look of
the<00:03:37.090> blue<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.510> don't<00:03:37.780> really<00:03:38.260> foresee

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
the blue so I don't really foresee

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.289 
the blue so I don't really foresee
myself<00:03:38.739> changing<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.310> out<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:39.700> they<00:03:39.970> did<00:03:40.150> come

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
myself changing it out but they did come

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.890 
myself changing it out but they did come
with<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.510> shoe<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:42.120> now<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.180> upper<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.600> mix

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
with the shoe so now the upper is a mix

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.110 
with the shoe so now the upper is a mix
like<00:03:44.350> I<00:03:44.440> said<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.769> two<00:03:44.920> materials<00:03:45.430> you've

shoes the blue is a really nice color
for<00:03:58.510> kind<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.760> higher-end<00:04:00.760> material

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
for kind of the higher-end material

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.819 
for kind of the higher-end material
suede<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.750> royal<00:04:01.959> blue<00:04:02.200> just<00:04:02.350> looks<00:04:02.560> really

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
suede the royal blue just looks really

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.430 
suede the royal blue just looks really
nice<00:04:03.420> one<00:04:04.420> thing<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.630> really<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:04.959> about<00:04:04.989> suede

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
nice one thing I really like about suede

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.759 
nice one thing I really like about suede
is<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.430> fact<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:07.000> it's<00:04:07.690> not<00:04:08.200> consistent

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
is the fact that it's not consistent

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.410 
is the fact that it's not consistent
across<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.370> other<00:04:09.549> when<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.820> move<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.209> you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
across the other when you move it you

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
across the other when you move it you
can<00:04:10.720> kind<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:10.959> get<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> color<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.709> change<00:04:11.950> a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
can kind of get the color to change a

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.289 
can kind of get the color to change a
little<00:04:12.250> bit<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.519> know<00:04:12.549> with<00:04:12.670> light<00:04:12.880> or<00:04:12.910> dark

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
little bit you know with light or dark

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.080 
little bit you know with light or dark
and<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:14.380> what<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.400> adds<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and I really like what that adds to the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.880 
and I really like what that adds to the
shoe<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:16.570> keeps<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.590> little<00:04:17.739> bit

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
shoe it just keeps a little bit

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.500 
shoe it just keeps a little bit
different<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.310> know<00:04:18.400> keeps<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:18.940> changing

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
different you know keeps it changing

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.599 
different you know keeps it changing
it's<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.169> really<00:04:20.470> nice<00:04:20.620> look<00:04:20.890> we'll<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.489> if<00:04:21.549> we

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
it's a really nice look we'll see if we

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.010 
it's a really nice look we'll see if we
get<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.789> little<00:04:22.030> bit<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.180> close-up<00:04:22.660> here<00:04:22.840> just

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
get a little bit of close-up here just

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.590 
get a little bit of close-up here just
so<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.140> can<00:04:23.260> see<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.710> quality<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> suede

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
so you can see the quality of the suede

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.870 
so you can see the quality of the suede
I<00:04:26.100> don't<00:04:27.100> know<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.370> showing<00:04:27.520> up<00:04:27.610> too<00:04:27.790> well

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
I don't know if it's showing up too well

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.320 
I don't know if it's showing up too well
on<00:04:28.000> my<00:04:28.090> camera<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:28.990> trust<00:04:29.290> me<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.650> really

midsole wrapping around which adds a

really<00:07:11.050> like<00:07:11.260> it<00:07:11.410> just<00:07:11.620> adds<00:07:11.800> a<00:07:11.979> little

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
really like it just adds a little

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.090 
really like it just adds a little
something<00:07:12.669> to<00:07:12.760> that<00:07:12.940> and<00:07:13.570> it's<00:07:14.530> not<00:07:14.680> too<00:07:14.889> crazy

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
something to that and it's not too crazy

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.500
