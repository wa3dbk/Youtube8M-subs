00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.630 
she said that I should watch her video
and<00:00:30.210> see<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.570> understand<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> just

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and see if I understand it and so I just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.440 
and see if I understand it and so I just
checked<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.090> out

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
checked it out

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.690 
checked it out
I<00:00:33.480> understood<00:00:33.989> most<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.489> bits

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I understood most of it but the bits

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270 
I understood most of it but the bits
where<00:00:36.000> she<00:00:36.149> talks<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.780> fast<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
where she talks really fast it's kind of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.369 
where she talks really fast it's kind of
like<00:00:38.489> too<00:00:38.790> much<00:00:38.969> information<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.780> take<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
like too much information to take in and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.310 
like too much information to take in and
my<00:00:40.469> brain<00:00:40.800> can't<00:00:41.219> process<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> fast<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
my brain can't process it that fast I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.610 
my brain can't process it that fast I
definitely<00:00:43.980> understood<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.469> would<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
definitely understood but I would have

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
definitely understood but I would have
be<00:00:46.739> able<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> watch<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.120> wouldn't<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.079> able

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
be able to watch it I wouldn't be able

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
be able to watch it I wouldn't be able
to<00:00:49.289> concentrate<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> long

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to concentrate for that long

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
to concentrate for that long
like<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.329> obviously<00:00:51.899> watched<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> video<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
like I obviously watched the video and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
like I obviously watched the video and
I'm<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.219> continue<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> watch<00:00:54.059> her<00:00:54.270> videos

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I'm gonna continue to watch her videos

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.910 
I'm gonna continue to watch her videos
because<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.649> good

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
because I think it's really good

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
because I think it's really good
practice<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.489> me<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.090> her<00:00:57.270> video<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.629> great

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
practice for me and her video was great

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.819 
practice for me and her video was great
so<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.340> enjoyable<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
so it was really enjoyable but I

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
so it was really enjoyable but I
wouldn't<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.920> able<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> watch<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.960> German

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
wouldn't be able to watch like German

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
wouldn't be able to watch like German
video<00:01:04.110> after<00:01:04.530> German<00:01:04.890> video<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.670> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
video after German video because it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
video after German video because it's
just<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.210> hard<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> concentrate<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
just too hard to concentrate for that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
just too hard to concentrate for that
long<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.890> maybe<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> build<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> up

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
long so maybe I just need to build it up

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.950 
long so maybe I just need to build it up
but<00:01:10.920> yeah<00:01:11.310> thanks<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.000> mean<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> watching

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
but yeah thanks I mean if you watching

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.280 
but yeah thanks I mean if you watching
so<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> guess<00:01:13.619> while<00:01:13.890> Tim<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.000> Clara<00:01:15.570> busy<00:01:18.290> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so I guess while Tim and Clara busy this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
so I guess while Tim and Clara busy this
week<00:01:19.560> which<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.580> good

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
week which is actually really good

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
week which is actually really good
timing<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.170> glad<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.500> didn't<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
timing I'm so glad I didn't go out just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.429 
timing I'm so glad I didn't go out just
because<00:01:24.000> otherwise<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.290> sleeping

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
because otherwise I would be sleeping

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.190 
because otherwise I would be sleeping
all<00:01:25.890> day<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.509> what<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.720> would<00:01:27.780> end<00:01:28.020> up

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
all day and then what I would end up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
all day and then what I would end up
planning<00:01:28.350> morrison's<00:01:28.950> tonight<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> would

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
planning morrison's tonight and I would

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.830 
planning morrison's tonight and I would
feel<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> stressed<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.490> I'm<00:01:32.840> not
