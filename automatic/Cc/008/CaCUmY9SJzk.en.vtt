00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.710 
monitor the flow distribution that we're
achieving<00:04:47.290> inside<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.250> cooler<00:04:48.670> in<00:04:49.570> this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
achieving inside the cooler in this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.690 
achieving inside the cooler in this
particular<00:04:49.930> instance<00:04:50.230> we're<00:04:50.770> measuring<00:04:51.400> a

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
particular instance we're measuring a

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.520 
particular instance we're measuring a
charge<00:04:52.180> air<00:04:52.420> cooler<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.960> we<00:04:53.230> can<00:04:53.350> see<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
charge air cooler and we can see that

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.910 
charge air cooler and we can see that
this<00:04:53.740> particular<00:04:53.920> tank<00:04:54.490> is<00:04:54.790> delivering<00:04:55.660> a

this particular tank is delivering a

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.860 
this particular tank is delivering a
flow<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:56.950> is<00:04:57.340> more<00:04:57.790> prominent<00:04:58.090> towards<00:04:58.750> the

flow that is more prominent towards the

flow that is more prominent towards the
bottom<00:04:59.050> section<00:04:59.590> than<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.950> towards<00:05:00.310> the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
bottom section than it is towards the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.190 
bottom section than it is towards the
top<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:00.940> we<00:05:01.360> know<00:05:01.480> that<00:05:01.630> we<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.870> make<00:05:01.990> some

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
top so we know that we can make some

tanking changes here to improve

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.510 
tanking changes here to improve
