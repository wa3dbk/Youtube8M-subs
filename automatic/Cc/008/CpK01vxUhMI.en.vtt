00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
hi Elsa I have created about 85 works

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.029 
hi Elsa I have created about 85 works
particularly<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.529> another<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.859> dance

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
particularly for another in dance

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.640 
particularly for another in dance
theater<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.539> were<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.500> those

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
theater and I were one of those

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.519 
theater and I were one of those
choreographers<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.369> no<00:00:26.760> style<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:28.230> very

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
choreographers with no style I'm a very

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
choreographers with no style I'm a very
eclectic<00:00:28.859> choreographer<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
eclectic choreographer so I think that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.820 
eclectic choreographer so I think that
if<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.539> saw<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.960> piece<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> mind<00:00:31.560> another

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
if you saw one piece of mind another

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
if you saw one piece of mind another
piece<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.730> believe<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.149> by<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
piece you would not believe it by the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
piece you would not believe it by the
same<00:00:33.660> choreographer<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.880> very

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
same choreographer I think it's very

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
same choreographer I think it's very
important<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:36.960> celebrating<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
think it's very important to keep the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.789 
think it's very important to keep the
mystery<00:01:20.119> because<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.619> good

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
mystery because I think it's very good

to have the pleasure of discovery what I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.910 
to have the pleasure of discovery what I
can<00:01:26.369> say<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.509> pass<00:01:27.810> under<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
can say is that it's a pass under the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
can say is that it's a pass under the
theater<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> never<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.320> it's
