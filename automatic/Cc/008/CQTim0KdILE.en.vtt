00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
two the note to the left call see if we

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.190 
two the note to the left call see if we

go down two white notes from there we

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.580 
go down two white notes from there we
get<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.700> then<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:41.020> use<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.260> letters<00:00:41.470> of

the alphabet so we go a b c d e f g and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.360 
the alphabet so we go a b c d e f g and
back<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.649> black<00:00:50.860> notes<00:00:51.129> are

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
back to a now the black notes are

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.190 
back to a now the black notes are
related<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.030> white<00:00:52.180> notes<00:00:52.450> so<00:00:52.750> if<00:00:52.809> we<00:00:52.960> sell

chords<00:02:53.709> if<00:02:53.829> we<00:02:53.920> sail<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.250> see<00:02:54.430> again<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.890> if

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
chords if we sail and see again and if

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.089 
chords if we sail and see again and if
we<00:02:56.980> skip<00:02:57.189> every<00:02:57.489> every<00:02:58.180> second<00:02:58.510> note<00:03:02.069> we<00:03:03.069> can

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
we skip every every second note we can

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.860 
we skip every every second note we can
get<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.370> C<00:03:03.549> major<00:03:03.760> chord<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:07.359> we're<00:03:07.689> using

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
get the C major chord so we're using

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.140 
get the C major chord so we're using
those<00:03:08.439> three<00:03:08.799> fingers<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:11.140> shift<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.439> up

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
those three fingers if we shift that up

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.210 
those three fingers if we shift that up
you<00:03:13.150> know<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.450> chord<00:03:13.720> starting<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.379> D<00:03:14.829> which

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
minor that's a B diminished which we're

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.620 
minor that's a B diminished which we're
only<00:03:25.750> looking<00:03:25.959> at<00:03:26.170> here

so you can do the same with the left

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.470 
so you can do the same with the left
hand<00:03:31.140> C<00:03:32.140> D<00:03:33.010> minor<00:03:33.400> E<00:03:33.850> minor<00:03:35.010> F<00:03:36.010> major<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:37.270> major

a minor when we're playing a left turn

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.690 
a minor when we're playing a left turn
we<00:03:41.020> often<00:03:41.350> leave<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:42.520> middle<00:03:42.790> finger<00:03:43.120> so

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
we often leave out the middle finger so

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.540 
we often leave out the middle finger so
it<00:03:45.700> gives<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.940> better<00:03:46.060> sound<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.290> muddy<00:03:53.550> and
