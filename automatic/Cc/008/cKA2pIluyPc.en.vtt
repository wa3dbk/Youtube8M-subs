00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
with the free synthesizer that you can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.560 
with the free synthesizer that you can
use<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.810> GarageBand<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> after<00:00:24.420> you've

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
use with GarageBand so after you've

use with GarageBand so after you've
downloaded<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.470> program<00:00:27.800> go<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> your

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
downloaded the program go to your

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
sound generator i found some that i

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.780 
sound generator i found some that i
really<00:01:10.710> liked<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.540> I've<00:01:12.540> started<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.990> song

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.600 

I<00:01:23.930> really<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.800> try<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.580> up

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I really like that so I try to come up

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.870 
I really like that so I try to come up
with<00:01:26.730> some<00:01:26.970> sort<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.210> song<00:01:27.480> with<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
with some sort of song with that so I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
with some sort of song with that so I
couldn't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.300> find<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> drumbeat<00:01:31.020> I've

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
couldn't really find a drumbeat I've

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.900 
couldn't really find a drumbeat I've
been<00:01:31.470> looking<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> drumbeat<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
been looking for a drumbeat that I

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.080 
been looking for a drumbeat that I
thought<00:01:33.260> would<00:01:34.260> go<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.980> kind<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> feel<00:01:35.910> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
thought would go with kind of feel that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.610 
thought would go with kind of feel that
I'm<00:01:36.180> looking<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.660> with<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.020> electronic

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
I'm looking for with this electronic

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.010 
I'm looking for with this electronic
sound<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.340> couldn't<00:01:39.120> find<00:01:39.240> anything<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.810> wanted

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
sound I couldn't find anything I wanted

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.950 
sound I couldn't find anything I wanted
a<00:01:40.110> drumbeat<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.800> was<00:01:41.070> very<00:01:41.940> minimal<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> was

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
a drumbeat that was very minimal it was

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440 
a drumbeat that was very minimal it was
very<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.830> want<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> focus<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.150> be<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
very I want the focus to be the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
very I want the focus to be the
synthesizers<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> beat<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.940> here's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
synthesizers and not the beat so here's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.310 
synthesizers and not the beat so here's
the<00:01:48.390> beat<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.930> isn't<00:01:49.170> anything

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the beat it really isn't anything

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
the beat it really isn't anything
special<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.040> designed<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.690> see

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
special but I designed it you can see

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
special but I designed it you can see
it's<00:01:58.050> really<00:01:58.110> nothing<00:01:58.320> special<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.160> then<00:02:00.150> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it's really nothing special and then a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.320 
it's really nothing special and then a
little<00:02:00.330> bit<00:02:00.660> more<00:02:00.780> protection<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.800> added<00:02:02.190> here

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.540 

so<00:02:06.330> together<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.780> sound<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:10.550> it's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so together they sound like this it's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.530 
so together they sound like this it's
very<00:02:11.730> basic<00:02:14.300> it's<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.510> nice<00:02:15.780> frame<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.860> hang<00:02:17.100> all

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
very basic it's a nice frame to hang all

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
very basic it's a nice frame to hang all
these<00:02:18.540> electronics<00:02:19.320> synthesizing<00:02:20.130> sounds

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
these electronics synthesizing sounds

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.070 
these electronics synthesizing sounds
and<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:20.970> together<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:21.930> I've<00:02:22.019> come

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and all together this is what I've come

00:02:22.080 --> 00:03:17.350 
and all together this is what I've come
up<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.620> far

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.920 

as<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.850> all<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.570> these

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
as you can see I have all of these

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.180 
as you can see I have all of these
additional<00:03:22.920> sounds<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:27.740> really<00:03:28.740> like<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.040> one

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
additional sounds I really like this one

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520 
additional sounds I really like this one
this<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:29.490> actually<00:03:29.610> has<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.940> very<00:03:30.240> good<00:03:30.530> crisp

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this one actually has a very good crisp

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.700 
this one actually has a very good crisp
sound<00:03:35.060> these<00:03:36.060> are<00:03:36.210> all<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.570> available<00:03:36.780> sounds

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
sound these are all the available sounds

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.840 
sound these are all the available sounds
and<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> sound<00:03:38.130> bang<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.580> this<00:03:38.700> particular

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and a sound bang for this particular
