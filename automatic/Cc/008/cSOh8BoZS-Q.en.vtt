00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:07.279
 one of the horses welcome to the canal 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.469
 and welcome to the new game in yos today 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.599
 It's Wednesday, September 25th, 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.070
 very much that I did not make a game in you 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.659
 see in this case taking advantage of this 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.430
 so nice silence that there is now 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.140
 same I do not know if because my neighbors or else 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.700
 have fallen asleep or to the state of 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.280
 a brain stroke to hear the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.020
 music so much volume I do not know I have 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.790
 the doubt then I take the opportunity to record a 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.960
 little bit be very good if you found the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.670
 what's new this has been 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.289
 these last days in the end I do not roll 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.860
 and we go directly to comment on 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.659
 news 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.579
 first of all let's start talking a 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.350
 little video game metal gear solid 5 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.449
 which has recently shown a 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.429
 new video in this case 12 minutes 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.319
 in the tokyo game show where we could 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.030
 see a little more content and in this 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.159
 case on the one hand first of all we can 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.629
 find the start menu the menu 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.100
 select the mission so that I 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.109
 you understand that here is not enough 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.389
 dynamic at least that seems and 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.399
 also on the other hand the rest of the 10 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.170
 approximately minutes of video in this 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.149
 case we go a little more than a mission 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.920
 at traction level and at the end like the one 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.210
 He is playing how bad it does is 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.010
 discovered and have to stay 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.510
 shots but good in order of course 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.590
 it is quite entertaining the video we see 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.570
 a bit like the video looks 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.399
 and in fact it is of ccoo meters that in this 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.229
 occasion the good title in the video that 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.729
 is watching on the screen is recorded with 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.840
 a playstation 4 for what you can 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.909
 get an idea of how he's going to look 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 obviously it looks much better than what 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.729
 You see in the video but one like that also does not 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.689
 it's just going to come out for this 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.460
 platform has also confirmed 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.780
 recently that will be released for xbox band 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.219
 the moment there is not a date of 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.539
 launch neither for one nor for another like that 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.670
 that will have to wait possibly until 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.959
 late next year if we go now 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 commenting a bit about the video game 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.229
 the watch tops and is that precisely 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.609
 also in the tokyo game show we have been 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.189
 showed a new video of this 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.349
 video game to the redundancy precisely 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.970
 the relationship is quite similar to that of 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.459
 metal gear solid 5 about 12 minutes 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.229
 approximately of video in which in 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.030
 this time we are shown a mission 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.640
 focused from a point of view of 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 stealth - is what it seems and also a 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.189
 bit of hacking really is nothing 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.110
 that we have not seen in previous 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.879
 trailers are earlier videos of this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.469
 title for a like that is appreciated but a 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.299
 little bit more content and remember that 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.860
 will go on sale in North America and the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.289
 November 19 arrive to November 22 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.599
 in europe and the rest of the world another for 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.280
 Precision 3 xbox 360 computer while 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.750
 willy and the next generation of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 consoles and let's talk about another 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.050
 title that coincidentally also comes out in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.490
 the same month in October 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 the case is to try batman arkham 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.670
 origin this which we have been able to see 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.080
 also recently a new trailer 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.420
 pretty short of about two minutes 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.340
 approximately especially centered 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.960
 in a tlc that will draw point with the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.940
 launch of this title and you have to 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.040
 see with the superhero of the strokes the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.560
 which we can handle it and have a new 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640
 game mode in fat mode mode as well 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.010
 say it not, well, we have to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 defeating an infinite number of 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.640
 enemies while we drive to this 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 superhero end pretty interesting already 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.210
 we'll see at the end of the east it's worth it 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.740
 or not but ultimately this trailer 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.450
 it only has to do with those 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.490
 memories that the title goes on sale 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.710
 on 25 October for Xbox 360 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.050
 playstation 3 nintendo wii and computer 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.910
 there will also be a different version 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.800
 of this same title and nothing black eyed 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 that comes out for nintendo 3ds and 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.460
 playstation vita we continue talking a 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.380
 little on playstation 4 in this case 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.670
 you have to make a small allusion to a 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.170
 title that has recently been 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.330
 confirmed that it will be free to play for 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.010
 this platform is about deep end yet 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.720
 a title of which he has already done 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.090
 I've been talking about showing two 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.860
 images trailers and remember that it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.870
 supposes that despite the setting 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.210
 medieval that they seem to have will be 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.580
 located in the year 2000 94 in new york 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.810
 so something strange is happening in 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.670
 this video game we do not know very well 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.800
 many details there is practically no 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.170
 nothing confirmed 100% from the moment 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.030
 it looks like it's going to be something similar to dark 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.800
 souls are also supposed to have 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.380
 a multiplayer mode of up to 4 people 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.390
 We do not know if cooperative or competitive 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.800
 we have no idea how to say there is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.150
 little details of fact I do not know 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.860
 even the release date so 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.420
 as soon as there is more news I will follow you 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.680
 informing the only thing that is known in the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.510
 time with the videos it a title 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.640
 free to play that will be exclusive 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.930
 for playstation 4 and precisely 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.190
 talking about free to play titles too 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.290
 we have to speak of course of the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.390
 xbox urban competition and we have to 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.670
 make reference to the title killer and this is 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.050
 a fight title with a pretty saga 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.700
 known that those who have a 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.650
 age sure you will remember earlier the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.000
 video game of which you recently have 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 has shown a new trailer in which 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.960
 we can see a new fighter calls 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.850
 a day and we see a little more of 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.260
 gameplay of this video game that as I already 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.700
 I said it will be soon play will be 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.250
 available since the launch of the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.170
 xbox one so if you like the fight and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 you want a simple title because here what 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.050
 you have to say in this case to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.340
 Although it is a free to play title 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.050
 yes it is true that to unlock 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.360
 some fighters we will have to pay 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.520
 money which insurance does not make 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.960
 thanks to all the users and almost 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.430
 to finish commenting have a little 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.110
 about valve who a couple of days ago 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.189
 he announced something quite interesting he 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.349
 it's about a new operating system 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.479
 totally free to announce 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.159
 coming soon in this case especially 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.139
 designed for our television and 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.360
 our home something that could be 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.490
 quite interesting several members of the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.050
 The video game industry has shown 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.849
 have interest in this initiative of 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.319
 valve and that can be pretty good in 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.550
 how much more there is to comment on 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.409
 how much that but you also have to tell 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.939
 that during today possibly 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.740
 when this video is uploaded there will be 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.389
 already announced the second of the three 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.310
 important announcements that you have confirmed 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.689
 for this week valve so from 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.639
 moment we do not know what they are going to 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.050
 look today but tomorrow if I can 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.789
 do another in the child I'll just try 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.650
 comment or in short when this 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.810
 video has been uploaded although I guess that 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.009
 7 will be for approximately fair 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.159
 for that hour it is foreseen that 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.020
 announce said new subject said surprise 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.370
 so maybe I'll probably put it 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.229
 in a comment for those who 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.270
 you have an interest in knowing what it is 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.469
 so far this gaming I hope that 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.110
 you liked it and made the most of it 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.390
 these minutes that I send selection the 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.890
 neighbors still by the way I just live 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.210
 they have already gotten back into their 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.550
 room so it seems that they had 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.400
 come out of a definitive return between 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.960
 the seconds will return the noise to my life 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.040
 thank you very much for watching the video be 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.040
 happy and see you
