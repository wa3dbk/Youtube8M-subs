00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.960

 great deal touched this painted canvas 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.709
 The good thing about it all is that the proximity to 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.390
 the south and ignited another old 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.830
 Good galvão saying that I am 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.550
 in love with horses 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.420
 Since I was little, that cost me the trophy. 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.230
 here is a gigantic fracture 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.120

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.670
 Creole is the soul of the gaucho campaign has 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.120
 a phrase during the war 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.380
 during the Farroupilha revolution there are ten 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.140
 when the future duke of cajias who 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.930
 represented the empire said 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.050
 this war will only determine if one day 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.750
 we have a cavalry force 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.250
 as important as one like his 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.890
 they were born on top of the Creole horse 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.190
 It's soul, it's beautiful, it's the day-to-day deal. 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.519

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 people create black horses 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.610
 along with the passion for the grape and was 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.860
 really the first time I could 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.350
 to realize this dream of walking for 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.230
 between the vineyards so there among the 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.410
 Fingers china and two close still scheduled 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.310
 for down there looking for a bunch of grapes 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 to be able to catch and a horse a horse

 of the comedian's blood one of the great 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.120
 history of the horse of Creole 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.170
