00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.709
 I want to introduce you to a very 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 interesting modern technology which 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:17.369
 called chenille very beautiful 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 get some garment 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.970
 accessories 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.039
 even they make it in front of you 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.659
 please years vest is very pretty 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.700
 made in this technique she is 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:34.829
 shaggy is cozy and very handbag 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.110
 the technique is done is very simple the same 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 can be used 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.520
 inward now I will show the fabrics that are well 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 not interesting by drawing on texture 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.610
 this should be made of cotton, you can do 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.310
 from some silk fabrics but need 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.540
 the fabric well here it will suffice la 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.580
 the most important condition 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.210
 so our wonderful russian 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.490
 Calico fits here perfectly because 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.130
 they are thin and very shaggy 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.220
 so you take several layers 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.220
 fabrics 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.600
 take the basis on the basis of the fabric which 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.880
 you are interested in it to show through 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.340
 here it is black here it is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 greenish I took the purple further you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.070
 lay layers of cloth which you need 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.190
 so they lah matter creating such 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.550
 volume up put the fabric that will 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.300
 create you top drawing this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.210
 equity thread 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.630
 strictly share thread here is one condition 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 this is a fractional thread 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.360
 grow your canvas at 45 degrees 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.330
 this will help you a lot here on 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 This line is marked 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.140
 degrees this is 45 degrees where 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 It puts this is now your line you it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.290
 put on 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.380
 you put it here this line on 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.860
 which is indicated by 45 degrees we put 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.950
 along the cross line like this 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 transverse respectively this edge 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.180
 rulers will show us 45 degrees 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 we need to draw width 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 stripes strong here these 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.080
 must be no more than no less than one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.770
 a centimeter is not more than one and a half 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 here is ticker us, too, will help here 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.280
 the lines that I spent on her 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.380
 I spread this cliff there polosochka 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.070
 which I need right now I'm still 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.190
 I will do even less probably I will do it 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.760
 so here is my band hydrocyanic again 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.150
 spend 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 and so i draw all my 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.810
 canvas 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 are we not or all of our canvas with 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.819
 stabbed him with pins and now for 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.459
 the lines that we are to whom we should 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.680
 stitch and strings need to choose in color 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.780
 for each ruler all the cloth stitching 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.650
 right through here our 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 rag 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 magical 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:35.450
 next strip don't do everything in 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.250
 do not sew one side but unfold in 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.920
 different otherwise your canvas will be 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.780
 move one over the other 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.590
 Now you asked this way now 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.590
 come back 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.450
 fabric must be at least 6 7 layers 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.770
 otherwise your chenille will be very liquid. 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.680
 if you will use some 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.320
 silk fabric which is very good 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.070
 bursting then you will have a feeling 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.380
 mohair fabric here we are with you now 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.560
 actually create a new textile 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.560
 canvas 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.989
 here were fabrics such as we are from ready-made 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.989
 fabrics create new fabric 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.670
 Now here we are all about scribing on these 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.280
 stripes now we're not touching 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:43.820
 the bottom layer in the middle of the times 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.910
 cut here what else is needed in 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.380
 patchwork sharp scissors and so everything 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.380
 we cut our canvas 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.680
 that's how we cut it 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:08.300
 and now you need to do the following 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.050
 his and so pretty hard to pat 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:19.930
 just very tough now go see 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:21.590
 how pretty well here if you lose 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.230
 as it should 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.480
 what ultimately when are we all this 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.610
 we sew we should get this 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.960
 This is the form of cosmetic bags 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.050
 here like with a flower 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.050
 and here she will be shaggy all
