really<00:00:42.000> loose<00:00:42.149> bun<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.570> night<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
really loose bun at night that when I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
really loose bun at night that when I
take<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.980> its<00:00:44.129> natural

volume<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.809> thing<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.140> noticed<00:00:46.559> while

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
volume but one thing I noticed while

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220 
volume but one thing I noticed while
doing<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:48.059> hair<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.510> rolling

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
doing that is your hair is not rolling

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.119 
doing that is your hair is not rolling
around<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> while<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> sleeping

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
around with you while you're sleeping

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.600 
around with you while you're sleeping
and<00:00:50.670> getting<00:00:50.910> knotted<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.899> actually<00:00:52.610> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and getting knotted so it's actually it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
and getting knotted so it's actually it
doesn't<00:00:53.910> break<00:00:54.120> off<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.600> easy<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.140> not

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
doesn't break off as easy and it's not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
doesn't break off as easy and it's not
breaking<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.680> while<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:55.980> sleeping<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
breaking off while you're sleeping so I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.119 
breaking off while you're sleeping so I
noticed<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.300> hair<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:58.129> definitely

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
noticed that my hair was definitely

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
noticed that my hair was definitely
growing<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:00:59.910> faster<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.199> growing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
growing a lot faster or will not growing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
growing a lot faster or will not growing
faster<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.829> wasn't<00:01:02.100> breaking<00:01:02.370> off<00:01:02.489> faster

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
faster it wasn't breaking off faster

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
faster it wasn't breaking off faster
than<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.600> growing<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.559> i<00:01:04.589> definitely

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
than it was growing so i definitely

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
than it was growing so i definitely
