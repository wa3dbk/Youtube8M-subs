00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.380
 there are several functions in javascript 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 to work with dates 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 the problem is that they are not shown 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.510
 in a user-friendly format when displayed 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.920
 on the screen 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:19.350
 see this example we create a variable 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 with the name gives both where you will receive the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:33.270
 date to improve this output we should 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 use specific functions to retrieve 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.550
 information about the date and show a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:53.520
 string with the accident function 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 we get the day of the month then we can 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.100
 get the month with the jetman function with 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 result returned numeric 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
 you can create an array that relates 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.250
 the month number to your name 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.619
 as a result of the function goes from 10 to 11 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 with 10 corresponding to January and 11 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.830
 December 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.830
 the matrix must follow this same pattern 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:39.799
 see we have created a matrix with 12 positions 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:47.990
 where each number corresponds to the month to 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:51.940
 complete the year cycle is obtained through 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.940
 of the ghetti function one day 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 Let's change the way it will be 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.030
 displayed on the screen 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.550
 and click the preview button to see the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550
 result 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.060
 there are several other functions for 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.360
 dates 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.580
 you can use them to display messages 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.380
 customized according to the time 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.560
 or day of the week 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.400
 the example developed in this lesson also 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.400
 it's on the cd rom
