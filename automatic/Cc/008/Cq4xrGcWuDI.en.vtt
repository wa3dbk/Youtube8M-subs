00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
that go so let me explain it it's called

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.720 
that go so let me explain it it's called
a<00:00:11.090> strategy<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.300> by<00:00:12.480> Rab<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.460> you<00:00:14.460> would<00:00:14.580> think

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
a strategy it by Rab and you would think

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.550 
a strategy it by Rab and you would think
it's<00:00:14.969> been<00:00:15.179> designed<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.690> an<00:00:15.809> insulator<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's been designed as an insulator and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.680 
it's been designed as an insulator and
it<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> an<00:00:16.949> insulator<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.670> feels<00:00:17.970> quite<00:00:18.330> big

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it is an insulator it feels quite big

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
it is an insulator it feels quite big
like<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> Premal<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.410> top<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> feels<00:00:21.119> as

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
like a Premal off top and it feels as

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.279 
like a Premal off top and it feels as
though<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.390> gonna<00:00:21.600> keep<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.900> nice<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.080> warm

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
though it's gonna keep you nice and warm

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
though it's gonna keep you nice and warm
well<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.279> does<00:00:23.789> keep<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> warm<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.779> we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
well it does keep you warm but what we

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.390 
well it does keep you warm but what we
found<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.800> good<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.250> being

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
found is it's really good for being

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
found is it's really good for being
active<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.720> let<00:00:27.810> me<00:00:27.900> talk<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.109> through<00:00:28.230> it

active in so let me talk you through it
first<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.220> material<00:00:29.760> inside<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
first of all the material inside it is

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.310 
first of all the material inside it is
not<00:00:30.539> prima<00:00:30.810> loft<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.320> polar<00:00:32.130> tech<00:00:32.460> alpha<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
not prima loft it's polar tech alpha and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
not prima loft it's polar tech alpha and
alpha<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.680> been<00:00:34.770> designed<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.280> polar<00:00:35.550> tech<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
alpha has been designed by polar tech to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.130 
alpha has been designed by polar tech to
give<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.140> warmth<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.790> insulation<00:00:39.020> but<00:00:40.020> give

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
give you warmth and insulation but give

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
give you warmth and insulation but give
you<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.530> high<00:00:40.620> levels<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> breathability

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you very high levels of breathability

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.209 
you very high levels of breathability
and<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> minute<00:00:42.930> I'll<00:00:43.020> show<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.590> it's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and in a minute I'll show you how it's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.590 
and in a minute I'll show you how it's
made<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> inside<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> you'll<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.480> that

made up of inside and you'll see that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
made up of inside and you'll see that
it's<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:45.870> full<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> poles<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> very

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it's actually full of poles like a very

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's actually full of poles like a very
posh<00:00:48.059> string<00:00:48.899> vest<00:00:49.280> that's<00:00:50.280> protected<00:00:50.789> by<00:00:50.910> a

wind proof outer highly breathable layer

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.569 
wind proof outer highly breathable layer
and<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> traps<00:00:54.930> lots<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> warm<00:00:55.710> air<00:00:55.949> which

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and it traps lots of warm air which

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
and it traps lots of warm air which
keeps<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.090> warm<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.020> full<00:00:58.260> of

mountain<00:01:09.360> biker<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.549> preferred<00:01:11.970> top

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
mountain biker this is his preferred top

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.390 
mountain biker this is his preferred top
to<00:01:12.960> wear<00:01:13.110> over<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> base<00:01:13.590> layer<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> winter

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to wear over a base layer in the winter

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
to wear over a base layer in the winter
so<00:01:14.760> he<00:01:14.820> doesn't<00:01:15.060> wear<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> waterproof<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:16.110> just

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so he doesn't wear a waterproof he just

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
so he doesn't wear a waterproof he just
wears<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.430> keeps<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> wind<00:01:17.939> off<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
wears this it keeps the wind off it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
wears this it keeps the wind off it
keeps<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> water<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
keeps a lot of the water off but it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
keeps a lot of the water off but it
dries<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.060> quickly<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.960> breathes<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
dries so quickly and it breathes so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.510 
dries so quickly and it breathes so
quickly<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.920> let<00:01:23.549> me<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.790> show<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
quickly so let me just show you it has a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
quickly so let me just show you it has a
durable<00:01:26.520> water<00:01:26.700> repellent<00:01:27.479> finish<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
durable water repellent finish for the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
durable water repellent finish for the
material<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:29.990> just

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
material so you can see that water just

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.740 
material so you can see that water just
does<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.579> sit<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> fabric<00:01:33.659> he

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
does not want to sit in the fabric he

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
does not want to sit in the fabric he
just<00:01:33.930> wants<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> roll<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.400> not

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
just wants to roll off now that's not

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
just wants to roll off now that's not
permanent<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.930> reapply<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.560> by

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
permanent but you can reapply that by

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
you've got wind complete wind proof

you've got wind complete wind proof
nurse<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:48.150> you've<00:03:48.269> still<00:03:48.390> got<00:03:48.540> very<00:03:48.930> high

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
nurse but you've still got very high

nurse but you've still got very high
levels<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.560> breathability<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:51.209> then<00:03:51.359> warms<00:03:51.720> up

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
levels of breathability it then warms up

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.520 
levels of breathability it then warms up
again<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:52.950> too<00:03:53.160> warm<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.609> climb<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:53.940> this

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
again and it's too warm to climb in this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.569 
again and it's too warm to climb in this
and<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:55.890> one<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> features<00:03:56.280> I

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and this is that one of the features I

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.190 
and this is that one of the features I
love<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> other<00:03:57.780> week<00:03:57.930> when<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.109> was

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
love and the other week when I was

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.590 
love and the other week when I was
climbing<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.650> Wales<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.820> was<00:03:59.970> even<00:04:00.510> though

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
climbing in Wales and it was even though

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.090 
climbing in Wales and it was even though
it's<00:04:00.720> still<00:04:00.780> summer<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> was<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.829> was<00:04:01.920> pretty

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
it's still summer it was it was pretty

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.960 
it's still summer it was it was pretty
chill<00:04:02.430> actually<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.510> had<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:05.130> similar<00:04:05.640> piece

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
chill actually and I had a similar piece

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.390 
chill actually and I had a similar piece
to<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.239> hanging<00:04:06.630> from<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.840> harness<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.220> what

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to this hanging from my harness and what

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.610 
to this hanging from my harness and what
you<00:04:08.489> do<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.959> fold<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.440> whole<00:04:10.560> thing

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
you do is you you fold the whole thing

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.070 
you do is you you fold the whole thing
into<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.100> large<00:04:11.400> chest<00:04:11.760> pocket

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.840 

and<00:04:17.080> then<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.350> gives<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.870> option<00:04:19.870> here

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
and then it gives you the option here

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.030 
and then it gives you the option here
with<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:22.000> loop<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.570> clip<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> carabiner<00:04:23.710> to

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
with this loop to clip a carabiner to

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.610 
with this loop to clip a carabiner to
that<00:04:24.970> loop<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.480> then<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.930> clip<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.500> your

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
that loop and then you clip that to your

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.120 
that loop and then you clip that to your
harness

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
harness

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.670 
harness
so<00:04:27.790> you've<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.480> weighs<00:04:28.690> absolutely<00:04:29.290> weighs

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so you've it weighs absolutely weighs

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.260 
so you've it weighs absolutely weighs
nothing<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.700> you've<00:04:30.820> got<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.030> on<00:04:31.150> your

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
nothing so you've got that on your

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.750 
nothing so you've got that on your
harness<00:04:31.630> you're<00:04:32.140> busy<00:04:32.410> climbing<00:04:32.560> away<00:04:32.830> it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
harness you're busy climbing away it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.520 
harness you're busy climbing away it
gets<00:04:33.940> chilly<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.420> get<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.720> belay<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.350> just

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
gets chilly you get to a belay you just

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.900 
gets chilly you get to a belay you just
pull<00:04:35.920> it<00:04:35.950> back<00:04:36.070> off<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.610> what<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.760> was

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
pull it back off this is what I was

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.730 
pull it back off this is what I was
doing<00:04:37.180> on<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.360> bee<00:04:37.570> lays<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.500> pull<00:04:38.650> it

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
doing on the bee lays you just pull it

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.430 
doing on the bee lays you just pull it
back<00:04:38.770> off<00:04:39.090> pull<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.180> out<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.360> here<00:04:40.660> slip<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.320> on

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
back off pull it out of here slip it on

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.680 
back off pull it out of here slip it on
and<00:04:41.650> you've<00:04:42.190> protected<00:04:42.490> them<00:04:42.730> warm<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.210> the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
and you've protected them warm and the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.360 
and you've protected them warm and the
whole<00:04:43.840> operation<00:04:44.350> just<00:04:44.530> makes<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:45.010> know<00:04:45.130> ten

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
whole operation just makes you know ten

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.650 
whole operation just makes you know ten
seconds<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:48.040> is<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.370> RAB<00:04:48.520> Stratta<00:04:48.910> polar

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
seconds so this is the RAB Stratta polar

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.650 
seconds so this is the RAB Stratta polar
tech<00:04:49.900> alpha<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:51.250> really<00:04:51.820> useful<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.390> really

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
tech alpha it's really useful we really

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.990 
tech alpha it's really useful we really
like<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.980> reason<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.400> want<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.610> emphasize

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
like it the reason I want to emphasize

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.180 
like it the reason I want to emphasize
its<00:04:55.840> breathability<00:04:56.170> is<00:04:56.410> because<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.920> could

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
its breathability is because you could

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.830 
its breathability is because you could
buy<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.430> thinking<00:04:57.970> it's<00:04:58.150> sort<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.630> an

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
buy this thinking it's sort of an

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.630 
buy this thinking it's sort of an
alternative<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> lightweight<00:05:00.040> down<00:05:00.310> piece

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
alternative to a lightweight down piece

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.570 
alternative to a lightweight down piece
and<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.420> all<00:05:01.630> about<00:05:01.840> insulation<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.800> it

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
and it's all about insulation and it

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.420 
and it's all about insulation and it
does<00:05:03.790> insulate<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.570> insulates<00:05:05.050> well<00:05:05.320> but<00:05:06.220> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
does insulate it insulates well but I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.100 
does insulate it insulates well but I
wouldn't<00:05:06.730> buy<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:08.020> the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
wouldn't buy this because of the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.560 
wouldn't buy this because of the
insulation<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.950> would<00:05:09.550> buy<00:05:09.700> this<00:05:09.760> because<00:05:10.330> it's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
insulation I would buy this because it's

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.050 
insulation I would buy this because it's
very<00:05:10.870> light<00:05:11.140> it<00:05:11.890> gives<00:05:12.100> me<00:05:12.310> warm<00:05:12.490> but<00:05:12.910> it's

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
very light it gives me warm but it's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.210 
very light it gives me warm but it's
hugely<00:05:13.570> breathable<00:05:14.170> it's<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.740> really<00:05:15.040> good

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
hugely breathable it's a really good

active pizza in a Premal off top I

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.470 
active pizza in a Premal off top I
wouldn't<00:05:17.650> climb<00:05:17.890> unless<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.030> was<00:05:19.150> bitterly

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
wouldn't climb unless it was bitterly

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.290 
wouldn't climb unless it was bitterly
cold<00:05:19.720> because<00:05:19.990> I'd<00:05:20.110> find<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:21.100> find<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.060> too

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
cold because I'd find it I find it too

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.600 
cold because I'd find it I find it too
damp<00:05:22.540> to<00:05:22.810> warm<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:23.920> I<00:05:24.040> have<00:05:24.220> done<00:05:24.430> and

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
damp to warm but this I have done and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.940 
damp to warm but this I have done and
will<00:05:25.390> continue<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.810> do<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.170> it's<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.680> really
