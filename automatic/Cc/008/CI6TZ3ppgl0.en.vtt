00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
on me got in here underneath my big toe

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
on me got in here underneath my big toe
on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.189> shoe<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
on the right shoe it's it's it's like a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
on the right shoe it's it's it's like a
centimeter<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> mean<00:01:09.299> I've<00:01:09.450> probably<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
centimeter I mean I've probably got a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
centimeter I mean I've probably got a
centimeter<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.650> lunar<00:01:11.070> foam<00:01:11.369> underneath
