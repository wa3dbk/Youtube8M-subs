BSI sensor and maximum aperture is f by
2<00:01:02.370> point<00:01:02.850> 0<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.449> let<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.769> light<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
2 point 0 which will let more light in

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
2 point 0 which will let more light in
even<00:01:05.909> under<00:01:06.270> stress<00:01:06.540> light<00:01:06.780> condition<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
even under stress light condition you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
even under stress light condition you
have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> secondary<00:01:08.070> noise<00:01:08.369> cancelling<00:01:08.840> mic

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have a secondary noise cancelling mic

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
have a secondary noise cancelling mic
here<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.619> fact<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> lone

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
here in fact I think that's the lone

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
here in fact I think that's the lone
noise<00:01:13.290> cancelling<00:01:13.830> mic<00:01:15.020> yeah<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:17.070> no

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
noise cancelling mic yeah so there's no

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
noise cancelling mic yeah so there's no
mouthpiece<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:18.170> here<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> back<00:01:21.150> side<00:01:21.450> has<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mouthpiece out here the back side has a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
mouthpiece out here the back side has a
very<00:01:22.409> nice<00:01:22.590> matte<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.369> rubbery<00:01:23.820> finish<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
very nice matte a rubbery finish I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.190 
very nice matte a rubbery finish I
should<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.650> able<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.890> open<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.880> back<00:01:27.090> cover

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
should be able to open the back cover

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
should be able to open the back cover

there is no hole though but then not

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.140 
there is no hole though but then not
then<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> demo<00:01:31.049> unit<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.939> HTC<00:01:32.939> might

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
then this is a demo unit and HTC might

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
then this is a demo unit and HTC might
decide<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.590> should<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.920> least<00:01:35.100> decide<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
decide to should at least decide to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
decide to should at least decide to
include<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.119> whole<00:01:36.329> shouldn't<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.320> opening

the<00:01:38.250> back<00:01:38.460> flip<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:40.140> easier<00:01:40.920> now

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the back flip that much more easier now

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.990 
the back flip that much more easier now
it's<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.909> an<00:01:42.000> adventure<00:01:43.610> let's<00:01:44.610> open<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's really an adventure let's open the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.899 
it's really an adventure let's open the
back<00:01:45.210> flap<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:46.520> pretty<00:01:47.520> thick<00:01:47.759> plastic

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
back flap and it's pretty thick plastic

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.569 
back flap and it's pretty thick plastic
and<00:01:50.390> then<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:50.960> removable<00:01:51.229> 2100<00:01:52.219> mAh

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
and then you have a removable 2100 mAh

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.940 
and then you have a removable 2100 mAh
battery<00:01:52.840> your<00:01:53.840> will<00:01:54.619> sim<00:01:54.920> cards<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.950> well

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
battery your will sim cards and well

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.069 
battery your will sim cards and well
that's<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.369> micro<00:01:58.670> SD<00:01:58.880> card<00:01:59.119> slot<00:01:59.179> then<00:01:59.960> you

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
that's the micro SD card slot then you

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.529 
that's the micro SD card slot then you
have<00:02:00.259> two<00:02:00.530> sim<00:02:01.189> cards<00:02:01.219> asim<00:02:01.759> called<00:02:02.060> one<00:02:02.270> and

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
have two sim cards asim called one and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.749 
have two sim cards asim called one and
them<00:02:02.689> seen<00:02:02.990> two<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.500> then<00:02:03.740> your<00:02:03.979> micro

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
them seen two and then your micro

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.459 
them seen two and then your micro
jacquard<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.359> remove<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.810> sim<00:02:06.049> one<00:02:06.229> you'll

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
jacquard so to remove the sim one you'll

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.800 
jacquard so to remove the sim one you'll
actually<00:02:06.709> have<00:02:07.069> to<00:02:07.280> remove<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:08.269> battery<00:02:08.629> so

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
actually have to remove the battery so

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
actually have to remove the battery so
that's<00:02:09.019> how<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.759> backside<00:02:10.759> looks<00:02:11.540> not

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
