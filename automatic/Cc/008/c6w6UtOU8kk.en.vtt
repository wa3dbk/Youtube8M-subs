hi this is Adam with new wave aquaponics
well<00:00:04.920> I've<00:00:05.040> just<00:00:05.069> completed<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.850> vertical

as you can see all the water levels are

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
as you can see all the water levels are
just<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.879> blowing

look at my sight tube and you can see

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.420 
look at my sight tube and you can see
the<00:01:00.449> flow

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.110 

of<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.060> water<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:07.160> very<00:01:07.580> simple<00:01:07.940> to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
of the water it is very simple to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.220 
of the water it is very simple to
plummet

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
plummet

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.620 
plummet
I<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:11.160> came<00:01:11.700> off<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> main<00:01:12.360> pump<00:01:14.630> which

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I just came off to the main pump which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.530 
I just came off to the main pump which
is<00:01:15.810> feeding<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.190 

and<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> line

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.880 

and<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.540> way<00:01:25.689> up<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.200> top<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.380> as<00:01:29.740> the

and all the way up to the top and as the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.190 
and all the way up to the top and as the
water<00:01:30.130> obviously<00:01:30.400> cascades<00:01:31.330> from<00:01:31.509> tube<00:01:31.960> to

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
water obviously cascades from tube to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.820 
water obviously cascades from tube to
tube<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.500> exhaust<00:01:35.860> line<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:36.430> right<00:01:37.060> here<00:01:37.830> and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
tube the exhaust line is right here and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:49.539 
tube the exhaust line is right here and
it<00:01:39.549> just<00:01:39.759> goes<00:01:39.940> right<00:01:40.210> back<00:01:40.420> into<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.899> tank

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.370 

there's<00:01:50.500> very<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:51.829> as<00:01:52.130> any<00:01:52.570> effect<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.899> low

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.880 

so<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.010> halo

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:26.020 

and<00:02:07.340> I'll<00:02:07.610> show<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.910> how<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.180> plumbed<00:02:08.750> it

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.440 

manacled<00:02:28.280> it's<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.459> water<00:02:29.700> off<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> main

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
manacled it's the water off of the main

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.350 
manacled it's the water off of the main
pump<00:02:31.940> instead<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> out<00:02:33.770> right<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:36.090> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
pump instead of out right here as you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.470 
pump instead of out right here as you
can<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> water<00:02:37.080> goes<00:02:37.349> back

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.040 

and<00:02:42.750> over<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.980> corner<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:45.330> good<00:02:45.630> luck

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.210 

the<00:02:48.470> return<00:02:48.860> line

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.280 

to<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.340> side

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.740 

being<00:02:59.129> alone

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:32.900 

those<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.410> school<00:03:02.770> filters

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.660 

to<00:03:33.330> quiet<00:03:33.600> down<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.050> vertical<00:03:34.230> garden<00:03:34.670> I'll

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
to quiet down the vertical garden I'll

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.390 
to quiet down the vertical garden I'll
be<00:03:37.760> lengthening<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.600> return<00:03:39.960> line<00:03:40.230> tubes<00:03:40.560> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
be lengthening the return line tubes so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.130 
be lengthening the return line tubes so
that<00:03:41.580> they<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:42.120> sit<00:03:42.390> into<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.690> height<00:03:42.930> of

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
that they just sit into the height of

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.980 
that they just sit into the height of
water

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.280 

and<00:03:49.350> right<00:03:50.160> here<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:51.060> where<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:52.940> duckweed

and right here is where the duckweed

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.540 
and right here is where the duckweed
grow<00:03:55.290> beds<00:03:55.560> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.040> which<00:03:56.580> all<00:03:56.790> tie<00:03:57.030> into

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
grow beds going to be which all tie into
