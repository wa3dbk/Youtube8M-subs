00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.270
 the red river or river of Mars in the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.239
 planet earth a river that has its 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.329
 red waters of blood color a 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.290
 river in which I would give a little bit of grimace to 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.910
 to bathe would not give a little bit of no 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.890
 it would be a bit strange of all 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.860
 ways it is not very advisable to bathe in 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.030
 this river because it has a very acidic ph in 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.030
 around 17 and 2.5 in fact there in this 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.860
 river there are no fish only there are some 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.260
 types of bacteria that are capable of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.590
 live in this river in the most environments 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.000
 extremes and who are responsible for the process 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.010
 of oxidation of metals 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.410
 the truth is that this river is plagued 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.600
 metal metal iron has some 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.240
 iron compounds that after 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 rust are those that have given this color 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.229
 to the red river the nasa has made multiple 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.100
 experiments on this river to try 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.229
 if it is possible that on the planet Mars 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 there was life, the truth is that if in the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.869
 red river of planet earth exists life 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.090
 on the planet Mars could also 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.149
 exist life because the conditions are 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.009
 very similar so it's a 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.380
 very interesting research that are 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.479
 carrying out those of the nasa and that they 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.570
 will help so much to discover life in 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.810
 other planets like to implant species 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.850
 of our planet on the planet Mars 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.759
 interesting, right 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 the truth is that this this river is 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.190
 located where I live in Spain is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.550
 located in andalusia has a length 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.100
 of around 100 km 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.490
 and the truth is that everyone who lives 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.700
 in the area they know it in fact 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.800
 it's a show to watch the water 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.450
 reddish when all the rivers 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.120
 they have a normal water not of color 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.030
 transparent in this case is a water of 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 blood color a water that has a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.130
 very acid environment in which they can not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.010
 live can not live any kind of fish 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.180
 just some of the most bacteria 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 resistant of the world
