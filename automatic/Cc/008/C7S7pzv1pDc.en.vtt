00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 what 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000
 sometimes 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.059
 Amen 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.939
 what I have left 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.350
 they previously dominated the party 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 we had about 34 occasions of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.400
 which next two and well there the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.420
 market favorable for us not 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.310
 only one that remains is still working 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.069
 then boys who are just 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.770
 starting then I do not know if you have 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.690
 observed last year's team and the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.750
 this year's team this year we have a 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.420
 completely new equipment new new 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.600
 the only two players of experience 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.060
 who are on the team and who are not 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.720
 well physically it is random 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.910
 and what is called frame frame good key 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 except for knew more of the archer 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.810
 so 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.080
 we are trying to form a team and 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.790
 I see that we are going to report ascending 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.460
 first because it's a fighting team 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.420
 inside the field 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.440
 there is an important tactical obedience and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.360
 good this 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.980
 The result that we live here is a 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.390
 important result with a team that 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.590
 I have not seen him play in reality but 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.230
 is a team that plays well that has 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.790
 good touch in midfield lacks 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.680
 lack a little more depth because 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.990
 because we did a close 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.820
 fence of three containment flyers in 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.280
 the second time for then against 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.320
 hit what we agreed in the dressing room 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.400
 which is the most important thing why I say 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.080
 there is technical obedience to be superior 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.240
 doubly those are pretty or not 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.410
 we are to do it to the downside 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.000
 perhaps the effectiveness of how it is received 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.970
 a process 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.970
 of learning we are with sure razor
