00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
anymore I don't if it might not even

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.770 
anymore I don't if it might not even
come<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.849> anymore<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.780> did<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:08.590> don't<00:03:08.769> know

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.710 
I think it's basically Justice League um
from<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.370> point<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.609> view<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.970> sidekicks

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
from the point of view of the sidekicks

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.229 
from the point of view of the sidekicks
which<00:03:59.350> was<00:03:59.709> what<00:04:00.069> Teen<00:04:00.489> Titans<00:04:00.519> was<00:04:00.910> supposed

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
which was what Teen Titans was supposed

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.900 
which was what Teen Titans was supposed
to<00:04:01.329> be<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.410> just<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.889> not<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.370> sequel<00:04:03.790> is

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
to be but it just it's not a sequel is

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.190
