00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:24.780

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.050
 create 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.170
 hello how are you all welcome once 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.899
 more to bon cuisine today we're going to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.559
 prepare a is very useful or well known 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.570
 like a very good smoothie super easy 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.360
 and you see that now comes the time where 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.220
 we want something for something rich fresquito 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.260
 we're going to do it from home so look what 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.690
 what we are going to need are red berries 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 in this case I already bought them frozen 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.950
 which is easier for me but if not you 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 they can do it with strawberries with cherries 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.030
 with what they have better now that is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 red fruit season take advantage of the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.710
 to the maximum ok and good ice cubes 16 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.080
 half a glass of milk and the side of 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.899
 vanilla this one already comes in bar I'm going to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 cut then more or less calculating the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.640
 two balls ok in the glass of the blender 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.250
 let's put the milk the ice cream the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.979
 ice cubes and red fruits to 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.619
 our preference we will beat 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.020
 until well crushed one 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.750
 thing do not go to do it in 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.479
 blender of you that does not have the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.820
 button for ice because if they are not going to 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.950
 burn the blender and then I will 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.290
 blame me so I do not want to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.200
 be to blame for that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.900
 let at least three minutes 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.060
 It will crush the ice and I look and I have 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.510
 it is very useful malted as best what 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 know I add my straw and it's time 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.030
 to enjoy it I hope you like it 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.370
 very easy and very simple and above all 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.940
