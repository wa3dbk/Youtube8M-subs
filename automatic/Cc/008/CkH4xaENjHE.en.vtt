now<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.910> see<00:03:03.240> again<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.780> will<00:03:04.020> at<00:03:04.470> fifty

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
now you see again that will at fifty

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.700 
now you see again that will at fifty
percent<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.730> 100,000<00:03:06.480> flat<00:03:07.290> means<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
percent in 100,000 flat means that a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.560 
percent in 100,000 flat means that a
hundred<00:03:08.100> percent<00:03:08.490> should<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.150> two<00:03:09.390> minute

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
hundred percent should be a two minute

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:18.650 
hundred percent should be a two minute
I'm<00:03:09.870> prouder<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.100> I'll<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.430> back<00:03:17.209> okay<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.240> am

back again so you see that a hundred

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.400 
back again so you see that a hundred
percent<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:21.120> two<00:03:21.330> hundred<00:03:21.420> thousand<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.260> I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410

how<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> edit<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.510> capacities<00:03:28.080> on<00:03:28.320> their

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
how to edit the capacities on their

how to edit the capacities on their
tractors<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.490> everything<00:03:30.140> combined<00:03:31.140> but
