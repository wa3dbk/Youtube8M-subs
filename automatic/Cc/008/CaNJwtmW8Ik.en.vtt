problem<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.510> his<00:02:48.140> legs<00:02:49.660> there's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660

really<00:02:50.930> no<00:02:51.200> articulation<00:02:51.830> they<00:02:52.100> go<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.490> and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
really no articulation they go in and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.220 
really no articulation they go in and
out<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.270> looks<00:02:53.570> like<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.780> could<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.080> to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
out so it looks like you could like to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.960 
out so it looks like you could like to
sit<00:02:54.440> down<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.810> kinda<00:02:57.170> stupid<00:02:57.320> um<00:02:57.970> they

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
off it looks like a robot probably would

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.100

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
arms we're on a poem all the way up they

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.130 
arms we're on a poem all the way up they
cover<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.250> into<00:05:30.490> this<00:05:30.610> blade<00:05:31.120> so<00:05:31.540> he<00:05:31.780> cannot

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
cover it into this blade so he cannot

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.550 
cover it into this blade so he cannot
break<00:05:32.590> out<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:34.510> then<00:05:34.720> you're<00:05:34.990> going<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.320> want

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
break out and then you're going to want

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.690 
break out and then you're going to want
to<00:05:35.710> fold<00:05:36.930> these<00:05:37.930> pieces<00:05:38.260> up<00:05:38.820> and<00:05:40.320> push<00:05:41.700> little

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
to fold these pieces up and push little

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.230 
to fold these pieces up and push little
grey<00:05:43.150> bits<00:05:43.390> down<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:44.620> he's<00:05:45.400> like<00:05:45.580> that<00:05:45.880> and

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
grey bits down so he's like that and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.550 
grey bits down so he's like that and
then<00:05:46.650> pushes<00:05:47.650> legs<00:05:48.010> down<00:05:48.479> so<00:05:49.479> you've<00:05:49.810> got<00:05:49.840> him

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
then pushes legs down so you've got him

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.520 
then pushes legs down so you've got him
in<00:05:50.919> his<00:05:51.160> little<00:05:51.780> containment<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:52.930> then<00:05:53.380> you

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
in his little containment and then you

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.640 
in his little containment and then you
have<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> little<00:05:54.250> human<00:05:54.960> control<00:05:55.960> center<00:05:56.410> here

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
have a little human control center here

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.790 
have a little human control center here
I've<00:05:57.340> built<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.669> stupid<00:05:58.210> little<00:05:58.360> human<00:05:59.050> looking

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
I've built a stupid little human looking

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.400 
I've built a stupid little human looking
thing<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.669> it's<00:06:01.090> not<00:06:01.240> very<00:06:01.270> human-looking<00:06:01.960> I

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
thing and it's not very human-looking I

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.900 
thing and it's not very human-looking I
should<00:06:02.650> just<00:06:02.800> use<00:06:02.979> an<00:06:03.100> active<00:06:03.400> figure<00:06:03.640> but

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
should just use an active figure but

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:11.490 
should just use an active figure but
this<00:06:04.840> is<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.380> think<00:06:05.650> better<00:06:08.040> sighs<00:06:09.990> accurate<00:06:10.990> to

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
this is I think better sighs accurate to

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.960 
this is I think better sighs accurate to
the<00:06:11.530> robot<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.390> an<00:06:13.390> action<00:06:13.780> figure<00:06:13.960> would<00:06:14.229> be

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
the robot and an action figure would be

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.100 
the robot and an action figure would be
um<00:06:15.970> he's<00:06:16.540> a<00:06:16.570> bit<00:06:16.780> shorter<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:18.930> cheap<00:06:19.930> little

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
um he's a bit shorter so cheap little

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.370 
um he's a bit shorter so cheap little
action<00:06:20.410> figure<00:06:20.710> thing<00:06:21.370> you<00:06:21.700> know<00:06:21.790> he's<00:06:21.940> half

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380
