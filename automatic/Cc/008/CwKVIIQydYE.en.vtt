00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.010
 the cattle community of the highs of 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.210
 petorca knows closely the damage that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.890
 can cause these carnivores 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 wild animals 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.510
 causing each important season 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:59.530
 low in their flocks from the sky 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.210
 is the most that does not kill a bushes of 72 the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.150
 rage like this 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.970
 because he always chooses them if suddenly 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.220
 there is a more old or very thin goat 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.220
 lacan kills her and leaves dida 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 as an innovative alternative that has 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.899
 given excellent results in the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 foreign ministry of agriculture 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.829
 through the agricultural service and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.350
 livestock in Indap bet to introduce 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.780
 this new and particular guardian in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.460
 flocks 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.460
 it's about the pyrenean dogs 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 not like the good one and goat 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.640
 I will tell 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.260
 Bear 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.260
 this particular mountain race in the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.560
 Pyrenees one of the characteristics that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.960
 has is first of all your package in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 genetic by saying it is a dog 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.410
 quite large from 40 to 50 kilos is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.620
 dissuasive with the site be the package 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.260
 genetic has power has the bark 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.060
 It has movement but simultaneously also 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.920
 has cut what is persecution and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.280
 house then that 's that genetic mix 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.110
 helps a lot with the environment and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 driving 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 with the imprint that is made is that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
 can do this work efficiently 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.580
 then the work developed by the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.740
 services with local communities 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.330
 about this new modality of care 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.310
 They addressed other strategies 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.800
 solutions such as livestock management 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.380
 through the improvement of the fence and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.590
 roof of the pens our work is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.360
 focused mainly on what was the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.740
 national plan for the conservation of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.140
 wild carnivores brought forward 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.300
 for the division of natural resources 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.640
 renewable services at our level 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.030
 national where one of the alternatives 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.130
 which are proposed as preventive measures 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.870
 for this is to work just in 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.270
 workbenches with others with others 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.100
 institutions and with communities 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.500
 affected to propose the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.790
 alternatives for prevention and solution 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.320
 to their problems they have to the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.050
 problems they have with the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.730
 wild carnivores the loss of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.620
 cattle derived from the attack of carnivores 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.409
 wild 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.060
 can reach up to 30 percent and 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.489
 with the addition of this protector 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.940
 it is expected to reduce these revenues to a 5 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.890
 percent 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.319
 in this context one of the situations 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.359
 serious will be when the female is attacked 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.040
 the farmer loses both his days and 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.319
 the production of milk destined for 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.510
 cheese making my part no 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.939
 both when they invited him to the meeting and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.569
 do not activate because pledge that 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:46.120
 we have the team 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.480
 in the year 60 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.950
 lathes button is fine time to put 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.269
 the 7 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.820
 suddenly damages 4 to pull but periods 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.290
 long and there are up to 20 goats 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.030
 m 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.959
 this project benefited the crianceros 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.879
 of the sector of torca on which it has 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.150
 a katrina mass greater than 300 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.310
 animals this farmer postulated a 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.799
 investment development project 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.700
 which basically consists in the purchase 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:25.130
 of the Pyrenees dog plus a small corral 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:29.460
 where the dog of the rest of the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.190
 flock to then incorporate it into the flock 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.580
 and more advice from the company 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.919
 for all that is the maintenance of the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.860
 animal deworming and how it has 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.000
 incorporated this animal into the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.000
 flock of this farmer 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.490
 do not 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.350
 with initiatives like this the farmers 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.410
 beneficiaries and their families may be 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.900
 more calm because from today they will count 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.330
 with a faithful guardian a pyrenean dog 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.370
 that will take care of your animals without rest 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.470
 very important because 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.470
 us that's why we live
