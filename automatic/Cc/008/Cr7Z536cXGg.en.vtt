most resilient and finish that you can

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.999 
most resilient and finish that you can
get<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.220> per<00:01:58.369> Florence<00:01:58.670> wheel<00:01:59.619> we<00:02:00.619> also<00:02:00.770> have

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
get on a per Florence wheel we also have

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.330 
get on a per Florence wheel we also have
two<00:02:01.220> other<00:02:01.600> styles<00:02:02.600> for<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.840> year<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
two other styles for this year the

point of reflection with these facets as

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.310 
point of reflection with these facets as
you<00:02:40.459> spin<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> wheel<00:02:40.880> you'll<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.810> multiple
