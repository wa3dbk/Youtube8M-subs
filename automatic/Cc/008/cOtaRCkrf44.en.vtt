00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.340
 today a short explanation about a new one 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.590
 I follow my brother's T8 LED 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 you leak the word it says electrically 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 controlled fulling 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.520
 Special indoor unit but good I'm going 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 show what this unit holds what it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 can do everything 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 when it is build in yes and other 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 trail day full of previous ones on this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 moment on the market are even the duration and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 26 this unit simply fits in well after 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.470
 we the youn cap weight loss 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.160
 You will see what other parts too 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.829
 seeing is now the on and off button 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.050
 this is how it goes for me and the charge is on 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 here as from a micro usb connection 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.370
 so that there can be a phone charger 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 can also just quietly full 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.399
 because before I have to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.989
 put 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.539
 let's proceed to the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 full of luck calibration always start task 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 in the zero position so put the bike 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.370
 calm down on the wheels and hold the button and eh 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.680
 seconds or three and four 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 lies on will calibrate and will twice 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 burning one after the other and thirty years 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.260
 for the calibrated and ready example 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.299
 to show how the fork 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.820
 it functions for which a zero 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.549
 You just see passes 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 sag go we basically slopes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.750
 your example would be high 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 So we put it on this box with you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 then you would see it looks like one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.130
 turn itself off but by the for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.090
 I get stuck 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.100
 anderson that is of course exactly 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.790
 the same couple that you were going to fall 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 the asset is in this position and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 see her that he functions immediately 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.770
 so that she really did very well herself 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.560
 the system 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.850
 this system can also set it up yourself 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 do you want for me who a little longer in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.040
 loc 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.049
 Locked was ready to ride 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 nameplate that you have logged in cora 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.090
 file to times him a callibrate 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.310
 little bit and give him up 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 the seeds fish teach to put higher up 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 then calibrate 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.079
 and the previous one speaks later to the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.880
 let sin spring 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.009
 optional on this full for the pillow ones 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.299
 leaks rumold control 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.770
 so still a possibility 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.290
 to turn the same on and off for me 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.290
 during the ride so that just remains 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.239
 for a bit
