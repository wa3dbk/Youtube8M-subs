00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.440
 Buy Jajan Panasonic digital camera lumix fz 1000 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:13.690
 This as much as possible, such as impressions that have been defeated use it Nde stood around soon 10 days of 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.710
 And Pochitsu when I want you please first put Ren current visit to tell the charm 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.150
 The day of the lens why extended it power on 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 Yes, you get zoom 1 scale moment 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.860
 However, I remember the last zoom position when I started before, how many millimeters now 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.129
 It is 400 mm 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:37.940
 It is 400 mm It is powered off with this once The power was switched off once again with this once again 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:40.140
 When you turn on the power, you 're coming to 400 mm . 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 Fixed point observation with this etc. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.449
 I think it 's quite good with people, but if you replace the battery and turn it back on, it will take you earlier 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.840
 Why is it us extend the Bu' in place 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.070
 I think it is useful for people who are going to time-lapse for a long time 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.130
 It's that time-lapse feature, but it's good again I'm looking forward to it a bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.239
 Silent mode to 5 th of the function button five there 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.980
 Aria I was able to call it immediately silent mode by it 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.460
 When not in silent mode 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:17.049
 If you focus on it, it will be a snap, so naturally the shutter 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.549
 The shutter will also be. When the silent mode is on , the shutter button is pressed halfway 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.320
 Even if it doesn't peep 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.310
 Even if you press the shutter 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 You can shoot this, but you can shoot 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:37.550
 If this is the case, for example, it will be a place where the shutter is at its solemn point wedding ceremony and wildlife and the same 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.140
 Time-lapse quiet remains balanced and I now time-lapse interval shooting and without having to worry about 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.310
 It is called but 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 Up to 99 minutes 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:52.170
 The shortest interval is real is zero to zero that you can shoot up to 9999 shots at intervals of 59 seconds 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.310
 I get up to numbers but 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.300
 You can do it from 1 second It will actually be from 1 second 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.600
 By the way, you can instantly access the timelapse with the continuous shooting mode dial 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:12.940
 One-shot continuous shooting bracket with self-timer and timelapse 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.160
 Even if you don't enter the menu deeply, you can shift to shooting time-lapses with a quick glance with the dial 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 That's why I'm going to shoot interval 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.440
 Pochi 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 It is very quiet in high silent mode etc. 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 You will be asked if you want to create a video as soon as the timelapse is done 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.540
 Then let's create a video How can you set the frame rate and so on here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.650
 The 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.770
 Studio of video quality also set she can and type 4 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.950
 Reverse 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:48.560
 It is also here next to Nde make correspondingly we Well, that's ... 3-to-2 in it and have taken 16: 9 video 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.340
 It is possible to have a hard day, but when shooting in Muratsu , it is possible to shoot with this 16 to 9 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.510
 It will be good 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.760
 Even if it is a group of familiar, this zoom ring 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.079
 You can switch this to focus 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.569
 You're you half-press the shutter was of entered when you switch to focus 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:13.230
 This is usually af auto-focus with this, but with this ring even more 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:16.049
 You can do full-time manual focus shooting with the focus ring . Mf 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.780
 Or display a little larger with assist 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.380
 Monosu 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.520
 Yes Telephoto is possible, so with full-time manual focus 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.030
 I Maybe I'm useful in such I Toka to shoot Class B's 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.850
 I can also shoot 4 type , but when it is 4 type 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.930
 I'm shooting with the old 1 b this 30 mm or so I say that the wide-angle side narrows 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.150
 I'm taking a self-portrait, but 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.900
 I still feel that I wonder if I still okay Once its own way was up the size of the face of this child 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.359
 but 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:52.579
 If it is 4 type while taking a self-portrait, it will be a bit tight 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:54.260
 We have worked hand-shake correction Toka firmly But this is a video camera I Na's a good camera 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.920
 I feel like it's okay 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.520
 When the flying I everyone 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.410
 Do you think you can shoot a tonko flying in the combo sky ? 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.500
 Fit Well can I can not be first, I little bitty seed early season also like that the focus 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.959
 It's a previous problem but it's hard to even frame 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.940
 But if you take a picture of dragonfly that is standing still at the branch of a tree with videos 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:23.260
 Someday if you take 4 type video 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:29.200
 4 type as a photo and press Poti at the moment that Datte dragonfly will fly dragonfly is taking off 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:34.930
 I can save it as a photo from a video, but it's a difficult moment that the dragonfly takes off 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.930
 You can capture it as a still image . Shoot the quick talk benefit movie and make a scene in it. 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.009
 I just bare it 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.139
 But if that kind of thing can be done as a camera function, then the present camera is good 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:47.539
 It is a place high speed animation 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:53.030
 You can shoot so-called slow motion, but it is also very beautiful with bath hd 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:54.920
 I Toka zoom if I'm capable of recording Well would once Press the shooting button record button 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.720
 I will not work with focus Well 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:03.200
 The limitations of functions come out at the time of slow motion shooting, so the other cameras are the same. 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 I don't think too serious about that, though 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.470
 I Kedomo whats the question of whether you can shoot and birds to fly I'm clean I was real is 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.690
 This is not 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.910
 Well, whatever camera you use, it's difficult, but if you try your best, flying birds can't do anything 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.770
 Absent 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:25.140
 I think that most of the camera of Tteyuu high-level Bookshelf Well, but Gamba and does not change so much 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.560
 By the way this camera troubles There is only one Ohara picture here here There is a dial on the front side 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.730
 not 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:34.900
 There is only one person who pulls the dial to the back side 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:41.320
 Well at least two with the aperture and shutter I was troubled 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.910
 It is switched by this Poti let the O ne potch erythematosus raised dot want dial 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.900
 Right 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:55.180
 Please look at this number and press it I will switch Koch Koch Koch Koch 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:06:01.000
 It is convenient when you just click on it without changing the position of this finger . 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:05.770
 Please check the speed of autofocus when shooting movies 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.700
 It may not be a reasonable practical speed, but it is comparable to a video camera 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.460
 is not it 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.990
 The focus of the feed is also to is smooth This is also very well done as a video camera 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.460
 I think so 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:21.020
 There are 5 function buttons, so you can assign various functions but 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:27.139
 Lonestar in can you selfishly be assigned any function 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:31.550
 I had some questions, but the functions assigned during shooting and playback are different first 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:38.960
 As a function to be assigned at the time of shooting, I am still here, but 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:41.009
 Speaking almost anything in the menu items for almost anything on 5 function machines 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:49.540
 Inside a house with four lines 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:50.560
 You have one page, is it 44 functions or yes you can only assign this 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.160
 Hey 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.160
 I saw all this 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.020
 Monochrome live view 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.770
 If you set it as a function button , even a professional Live Viewfinder 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.390
 I agree 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:10.590
 Even in the case of the finder you can switch between color and monochrome 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:14.370
 p By combining gold with something, I think it will be easier to grasp the focus 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.150
 After all it is light and shade of shade It becomes easy to see it 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.330
 This kind of expert function also 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:22.930
 I really liked it when I was properly equipped 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:30.070
 After all it is a video camera and an important zoom factor 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:35.440
 I think from the wide-angle end to the telephoto end I zoom in at a great magnification 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:36.169
 Only the optical zoom is ia Zoom super resolution It is really by combining this too 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520
 Far 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.520
 Can be transferred 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:46.850
 This 4 Recommended ze Onekotchi down than using rashly position, such as a knife of it that the 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:51.830
 I can do it 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:56.120
 Well, next time , I would like to compare the selling children with this 1 inch sensor . 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:58.690
 It will be fun if you compare it by taking photos 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.690
 Still
