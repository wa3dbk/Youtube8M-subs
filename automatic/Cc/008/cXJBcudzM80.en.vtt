seat and I went ahead and connected all
the<00:00:27.810> other<00:00:28.230> wires<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.770> know<00:00:29.280> you<00:00:29.520> guys<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.880> two

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the other wires I know you guys see two

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.290 
the other wires I know you guys see two
wires<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> red

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
wires but one is the with the red

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
wires but one is the with the red
indicating<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.539> coming<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.670> from

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
indicating that's coming from the from

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.349 
indicating that's coming from the from
the<00:00:35.760> battery<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.079> black

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
the battery and the one with the black

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.090 
the battery and the one with the black
covering<00:00:39.359> that's<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.289> one<00:00:40.409> that's<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
covering that's the one that's for the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
covering that's the one that's for the
ground<00:00:41.339> so<00:00:41.909> uh<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.329> didn't<00:00:43.170> switch<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:45.170> cable

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
ground so uh I didn't switch the cable

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
ground so uh I didn't switch the cable
color<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.159> left<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.429> as<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.729> since<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
color so I just left it as this since I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.579 
color so I just left it as this since I
already<00:00:48.149> had<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> screwed<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:48.989> bolted<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
already had it screwed and bolted on

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.200 
already had it screwed and bolted on
there<00:00:49.769> I<00:00:50.359> got<00:00:51.359> the<00:00:51.389> ground<00:00:51.719> ball<00:00:52.909> to<00:00:53.909> right<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
there I got the ground ball to right to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.629 
there I got the ground ball to right to
the<00:00:54.329> seat<00:00:54.960> frame<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.889> goes<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
the seat frame and that goes to the

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.379 
the seat frame and that goes to the
actual<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> body<00:00:58.739> chassis<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.999> I<00:01:00.030> think

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
actual to the body chassis so I think

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.719 
actual to the body chassis so I think
that<00:01:00.510> should<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.659> all<00:01:00.839> right<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.429> thing

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
that should be all right so all thing

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.189 
that should be all right so all thing
that's<00:01:02.909> left<00:01:03.179> to<00:01:03.269> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.479> go<00:01:03.839> ahead<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.019> put

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that's left to do is go ahead and put

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.010 
that's left to do is go ahead and put
the<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.330> plate<00:01:06.570> over<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.930> screw<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

subwoofer could sit and screw in
correctly<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.359> went<00:01:30.750> ahead<00:01:30.869> instead<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
correctly and I went ahead instead of

correctly and I went ahead instead of
putting<00:01:33.289> one<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.409> those<00:01:34.500> connector<00:01:35.130> wire

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
putting one of those connector wire
connectors<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.500> ended<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.359> Jillian<00:01:39.359> oh<00:01:39.689> ho

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.440 
connectors I ended up just Jillian oh ho
and<00:01:40.469> just<00:01:40.740> running<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> cable<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.149> I'm<00:01:42.329> just

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and just running the cable and I'm just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
and just running the cable and I'm just
gonna<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:42.810> some<00:01:42.840> sealant<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> that

gonna put some sealant there and that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.840 
gonna put some sealant there and that
way<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.609> a<00:01:44.700> better<00:01:44.939> seal<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> box<00:01:46.850> I've

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
way it's a better seal in the box I've

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
way it's a better seal in the box I've
seen<00:01:48.090> several<00:01:48.329> people<00:01:48.539> do<00:01:48.749> it<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.469> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
seen several people do it this way and I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.889 
seen several people do it this way and I
thought<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:50.549> idea<00:01:50.609> so<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
thought this was a pretty good idea so I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.239 
thought this was a pretty good idea so I
just<00:01:52.020> went<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.289> just<00:01:52.350> did<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
just went in just did it this way that

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.690 
just went in just did it this way that
way<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> could<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> better<00:01:54.560> seal<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.490> box

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
way I could get a better seal on the box

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
way I could get a better seal on the box
and<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.960> any<00:01:58.020> air

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and that way you don't get any air

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.580 
and that way you don't get any air
escape<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.420> gonna<00:02:00.600> behind<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> going

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
escape so I'm gonna behind just going

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
escape so I'm gonna behind just going
connect<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.429> amp<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.359> then<00:02:03.600> solving<00:02:03.960> in

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
connect it to my amp and then solving in

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.840 
connect it to my amp and then solving in
my<00:02:04.200> truck

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.109

bit<00:02:14.880> incline<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.330> now<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.870> way<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:16.990> could

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
bit incline it and now that way I could

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.330 
bit incline it and now that way I could
fit<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.440> box<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:17.980> little<00:02:18.100> bit<00:02:18.220> better

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
fit the box in there little bit better

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
fit the box in there little bit better
but<00:02:19.060> once<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.660> got<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.410> there<00:02:21.480> seat<00:02:22.480> back<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
but once I got it in there seat back and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.730 
but once I got it in there seat back and
I<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.490> my<00:02:24.520> amp<00:02:24.970> right<00:02:25.240> there<00:02:28.680> all<00:02:29.680> right

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
I have my amp right there all right

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.230 
I have my amp right there all right
coming<00:02:30.160> back<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.760> see<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:31.060> better

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
coming back so you can see the better

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:45.990 
coming back so you can see the better
look<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> lamp<00:02:33.209> right<00:02:34.209> here<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:45.850> my

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
look of the lamp right here got my

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.890 
look of the lamp right here got my
wiring<00:02:46.350> done<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> box<00:02:51.900> doesn't

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
wiring done and you see the box doesn't

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.810 
wiring done and you see the box doesn't
stick<00:02:53.170> out<00:02:53.290> too<00:02:53.560> much<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.250> think<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.670> looks

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
stick out too much so I think it looks

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.290 
stick out too much so I think it looks
all<00:02:54.940> right

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
all right

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.330 
all right

I still need to put some of that carpet
finish<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.940> way<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.120> looks<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.300> little<00:02:58.360> bit

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
finish that way it looks a little bit

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.780 
finish that way it looks a little bit
better<00:02:58.780> all<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.590> did<00:02:59.860> just<00:03:00.040> put<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.310> spray
