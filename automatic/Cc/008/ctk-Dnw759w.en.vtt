00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.680 
so I just want to show you guys the part
that<00:02:03.690> comes<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.050> it

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.300 

it<00:02:07.290> comes<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:07.770> deep<00:02:08.040> part<00:02:08.479> here<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
it comes with this deep part here and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.940 
it comes with this deep part here and
the<00:02:11.310> part<00:02:11.640> color<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:13.490> really<00:02:14.490> weird<00:02:14.910> color

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the part color is a really weird color

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.760 
the part color is a really weird color
so<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> put<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:18.050> foundation<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.320> part<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
so I put some foundation in the part so

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.230 
so I put some foundation in the part so
that<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.980> would<00:02:23.070> be<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.460> color<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.820> my

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that it would be like the color of my

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.480 
that it would be like the color of my
scalp<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.710> will<00:02:25.800> blend<00:02:25.920> better

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
scalp so it will blend better

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.490 
scalp so it will blend better
and<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.870> always<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.950> always<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.360> believe<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> in

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
can see it kind of humps a little bit

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.290 
can see it kind of humps a little bit
but<00:04:47.639> it's<00:04:48.630> nothing<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.110> can't<00:04:49.560> deal<00:04:49.830> with

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
but it's nothing that I can't deal with

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.750 
but it's nothing that I can't deal with
but<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.539> feel<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.990> constantly<00:04:52.760> wasn't

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
but I feel like I constantly wasn't

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.960 
but I feel like I constantly wasn't
pressing<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.810> down<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.610> didn't<00:04:56.849> have

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
pressing it down so that it didn't have

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.690 
pressing it down so that it didn't have
that<00:04:57.000> kampala<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.229> it
