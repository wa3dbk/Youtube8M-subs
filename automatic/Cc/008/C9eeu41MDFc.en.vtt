00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
off like you would if you were going to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.170 
off like you would if you were going to
apply<00:00:28.829> it<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> wall<00:00:29.460> you're<00:00:29.759> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> take

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
apply it to a wall you're going to take

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.999 
apply it to a wall you're going to take
the<00:00:30.239> inside<00:00:30.809> so<00:00:31.410> we're<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.680> take<00:00:31.800> out

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the inside so we're going to take out

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.320 
the inside so we're going to take out
the<00:00:32.189> letters<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> you're<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> pick

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
the letters so you're just going to pick

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.700 
the letters so you're just going to pick
out<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> letters<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.080> make<00:00:37.260> sure<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
out the letters and make sure that you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.820 
out the letters and make sure that you
leave<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.130> insides<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.030> these<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.530> letters

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
leave the insides of these the letters

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.950 
leave the insides of these the letters
there<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> word

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
there so that it will say the word

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.540 
there so that it will say the word
completely

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.740 

after<00:00:52.550> you've<00:00:52.700> picked<00:00:52.880> all<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.239> letters<00:00:53.540> out

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
after you've picked all the letters out

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.840 
after you've picked all the letters out
it<00:00:53.960> will<00:00:54.079> look<00:00:54.230> like<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:55.610> we're<00:00:55.730> going

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
it will look like this then we're going

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.450 
it will look like this then we're going
to<00:00:55.940> take<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.450> transfer<00:00:56.930> tape<00:00:57.280> we're<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:58.400> to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
to take the transfer tape we're going to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.600 
to take the transfer tape we're going to
place<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.670> over<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.059> top

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.320 

Oh

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.000 

can<00:01:13.960> press<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.710> there<00:01:19.800> they're<00:01:20.800> going<00:01:20.920> to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
can press it on there they're going to

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:45.420 
can press it on there they're going to
pull<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.250> back<00:01:21.430> off

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.310 

and<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.150> will<00:01:46.300> look<00:01:46.450> like<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.230> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and that will look like this it's on the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.170 
and that will look like this it's on the
back<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.680> transfer<00:01:48.100> tape<00:01:48.310> then<00:01:49.060> we're

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
back of the transfer tape then we're

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.200 
back of the transfer tape then we're
going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.360> take<00:01:49.450> our<00:01:49.510> jar<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.910> we'll<00:01:51.910> just<00:01:52.000> lay

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
going to take our jar and we'll just lay

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.750 
going to take our jar and we'll just lay
it<00:01:52.330> over<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.600> top<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.050> jar<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:54.220> position

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
it over the top of the jar and position

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.210 
it over the top of the jar and position
it<00:01:54.880> however<00:01:55.120> you<00:01:55.390> want<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:57.010> then<00:01:57.130> you're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
it however you want to and then you're

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:08.910 
it however you want to and then you're
going<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.370> rub<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.850> there

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.980 

after<00:02:09.640> you've<00:02:09.759> done<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.330> will<00:02:10.479> take<00:02:10.750> off

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
after you've done that you will take off

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:29.470 
after you've done that you will take off
the<00:02:11.170> transfer<00:02:11.680> tape

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 

now<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.080> thing<00:02:30.349> about<00:02:30.379> etching<00:02:30.920> cream<00:02:30.950> is

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
now the thing about etching cream is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.430 
now the thing about etching cream is
that<00:02:31.550> whatever<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.300> glass<00:02:32.750> wherever<00:02:33.290> there

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
that whatever the glass wherever there

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.199 
that whatever the glass wherever there
is<00:02:33.470> glass<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.430> want<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.640> make<00:02:34.730> sure<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.970> cover

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
is glass you want to make sure you cover

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.910 
is glass you want to make sure you cover
it<00:02:35.390> with<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.690> leftover<00:02:36.200> transfer<00:02:36.590> tape<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
it with your leftover transfer tape so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.619 
it with your leftover transfer tape so
we'll<00:02:37.069> take<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.610> we'll<00:02:37.730> fill<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.180> these

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
we'll take this and we'll fill in these

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.210 
we'll take this and we'll fill in these
sections<00:02:38.930> because<00:02:39.200> anything<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.010> glass

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
sections because anything that the glass

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.160 
sections because anything that the glass
etching<00:02:40.489> touches<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.390> will<00:02:41.720> burn<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> hole

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
etching touches it will burn a hole

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.080 
etching touches it will burn a hole
through<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.620> it's<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.220> show<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.549> as<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> as

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
through so it's going to show up as a as

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.550 
through so it's going to show up as a as
a<00:02:44.330> spot<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:44.959> want<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> make<00:02:45.260> sure<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.440> do

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
a spot so we want to make sure we do

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:57.010 
a spot so we want to make sure we do
fill<00:02:45.739> those<00:02:45.920> in

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.660 

when<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> all<00:02:58.500> taped<00:02:58.770> you're<00:02:59.550> going

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
when you have it all taped you're going

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.530 
when you have it all taped you're going
