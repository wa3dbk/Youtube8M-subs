00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.379
 hello friends the recipe that I have is 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.730
 sweet rice for 4 hours ago I 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.210
 had soaking 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.910
 half a cup of pearl rice I've had it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.650
 for four hours soaking and now 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 I've put it to cook because this rice 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.880
 must be done in a very slow process 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.510
 and the rice started to live 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.100
 It already started 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.270
 also to spend the liquid 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.680
 then I observed 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.970
 and the fan of belgrano then 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 I'm going to put half a can of milk 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.180
 coconut 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.640
 let's stir 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.660
 and cover up I observed the boiling point 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.660
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.250
 already probed a grain 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 I'm thinking about it 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.770
 because he already tends to express 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:32.229
 I'm going to put half a cup of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.229
 sweet grated coconut law 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.159
 and that's it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.450
 I'm going to separate it from the fire 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.320
 now 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 we are going to add 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.689
 coconut syrup 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.860
 and we are going to cover and well spent 10 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.600
 minutes of having covered it now I'm going to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.280
 pour in a wide wide container 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.300
 to cool 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 and set well 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.409
 and while 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.080
 he said that the rice finished absorbing 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.450
 cooling down let's move on 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.540
 this advanced that I have around here for 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.629
 here 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.379
 if I'm pretending to take out some plates 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.379
 well finite 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 and we are going to prepare a honey solution 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.680
 of bee with lemon + 3 tablespoons of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.140
 sugar for 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.140
 these oranges these buttons 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 and good friends there they have 3 tablespoons of 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.830
 sugar sugar brown droplets 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.830
 lemon 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.660
 and we're going to put it on fire here 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.020
 I told a crazy slider ton and chin 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.650
 chopped 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.050
 So here I have a room in the cup 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.630
 of honey in a tablespoon of water 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.630
 hot we are going to add you 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.720
 we are going to mix them 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.360
 and we're going to put it in the peach 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.560
 we are going to separate them and well there they have them 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.239
 since the peaches are already gone 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.239
 they already have rice 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:19.630
 what do you think about this delicious rice with 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.980
 coconut garnished with a sweetened peach 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.250
 with honey 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.730
 thanks for watching and until next 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.730
 meeting
