time<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.649> saw<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.830> character<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.340> thought<00:01:10.550> it

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
time I saw the character I thought it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.520 
time I saw the character I thought it
looked<00:01:10.759> absolutely<00:01:10.940> great<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:12.380> never

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
looked absolutely great I just never

actually<00:01:12.800> saw<00:01:13.100> him<00:01:13.160> before<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.490> thought<00:01:13.759> I

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
actually saw him before I thought I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.370 
actually saw him before I thought I
didn't<00:01:14.119> have<00:01:14.210> any<00:01:14.360> comics<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.780> read<00:01:14.990> back<00:01:15.170> then

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
didn't have any comics to read back then

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.680 
didn't have any comics to read back then
so<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.369> love<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.729> character<00:01:17.090> ever<00:01:17.270> since<00:01:17.450> then

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
so I love the character ever since then

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.870 
so I love the character ever since then
and<00:01:18.050> he<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.500> portrayed<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.160> be<00:01:19.399> kind<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.700> more

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
and he was portrayed to be kind of more

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.639 
and he was portrayed to be kind of more
of<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.149> skinny<00:01:20.539> character<00:01:21.080> with<00:01:21.259> just<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.560> his

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
of a skinny character with just in his

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.559 
of a skinny character with just in his
regular<00:01:21.800> form<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:22.910> then<00:01:23.060> he<00:01:23.149> would<00:01:23.270> turn<00:01:23.420> into

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
regular form but then he would turn into

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.660 
regular form but then he would turn into
this<00:01:23.780> more<00:01:23.959> monstrous<00:01:24.380> anti-venom<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.310> feel

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
this more monstrous anti-venom and feel

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.370 
this more monstrous anti-venom and feel
like<00:01:25.789> this<00:01:26.000> was<00:01:26.209> kind<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.630> between<00:01:26.780> those

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
like this was kind of in between those

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.710 
like this was kind of in between those
two<00:01:27.800> so<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.610> kind<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:28.789> does<00:01:28.910> fit<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.209> build<00:01:29.539> of

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
two so it kind of does fit the build of

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.680 
two so it kind of does fit the build of
the<00:01:29.869> game<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.560> certain<00:01:30.890> way<00:01:31.390> but<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:32.539> not

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
the game in a certain way but it's not

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.630 
the game in a certain way but it's not
too<00:01:33.080> big<00:01:33.349> and<00:01:33.590> we'll<00:01:33.709> get<00:01:33.800> into<00:01:33.950> sizes<00:01:34.369> later

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
too big and we'll get into sizes later

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.960 
too big and we'll get into sizes later
and<00:01:35.410> yeah<00:01:36.410> basically<00:01:37.009> I'm<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.429> little<00:01:37.729> bit<00:01:37.819> more

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
and yeah basically I'm a little bit more

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.370 
and yeah basically I'm a little bit more
happy<00:01:38.179> mostly<00:01:38.569> because<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.869> see<00:01:39.259> this

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
happy mostly because I see this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.749 
happy mostly because I see this
character<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.039> really<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.580> story

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
character and I really like the story

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.270 
character and I really like the story
from<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.239> edge<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.509> time<00:01:41.630> video<00:01:41.929> game<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:42.470> that

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
from the edge of time video game so that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.190 
from the edge of time video game so that
might<00:01:43.429> be<00:01:43.550> me<00:01:43.789> going<00:01:44.179> a<00:01:44.270> little<00:01:44.390> bit<00:01:44.630> more<00:01:44.840> soft

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
might be me going a little bit more soft

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.380 
might be me going a little bit more soft
on<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:45.530> figure<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.399> Aurora<00:01:46.700> could<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.179> say

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
on this figure but Aurora could just say

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.839 
on this figure but Aurora could just say
that<00:01:47.890> it's<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.069> nothing<00:01:49.399> too<00:01:49.580> special

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
that it's just nothing too special

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.309 
that it's just nothing too special
there's<00:01:50.270> no<00:01:50.450> paint<00:01:50.810> shading<00:01:51.140> going

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
there's no paint shading going

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.169 
there's no paint shading going
throughout<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.619> figure<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.190> all<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:53.030> only

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
throughout the figure at all the only

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.729 
throughout the figure at all the only
difference<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.690> pain<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.050> only<00:01:54.229> because<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
difference in pain is only because the

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.219 
difference in pain is only because the
sculpt<00:01:55.190> or<00:01:55.399> because<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:56.179> body<00:01:56.660> parts<00:01:57.050> of

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
sculpt or because the body parts of

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.260 
sculpt or because the body parts of
plastic<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:57.770> different<00:01:58.160> for<00:01:58.280> example<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
plastic are different for example the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.749 
plastic are different for example the
head<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.899> chest<00:01:59.929> and<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.800> bicep<00:02:01.220> section<00:02:01.580> is

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
head the chest and the bicep section is

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.880 
head the chest and the bicep section is
all<00:02:01.910> very<00:02:02.090> shiny<00:02:02.569> coming<00:02:02.989> almost<00:02:03.319> up<00:02:03.530> for<00:02:03.619> less

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
all very shiny coming almost up for less

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.010 
all very shiny coming almost up for less
of<00:02:04.069> whites<00:02:04.310> while<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.119> areas<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.599> the<00:02:05.720> form

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
of whites while the areas of the form

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.710 
of whites while the areas of the form
the<00:02:06.289> legs<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.979> yeah<00:02:07.700> mostly<00:02:08.060> those<00:02:08.239> parts<00:02:08.599> are

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the spider going across the entire chest

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.820 
the spider going across the entire chest
and<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.910> back<00:02:40.120> isn't<00:02:40.480> all<00:02:40.600> bad<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> does

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
and the back isn't all bad but it does

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.140 
and the back isn't all bad but it does
get<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> little<00:02:42.100> bit<00:02:42.340> worse<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.940> back

get a little bit worse on the back
section<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> can't<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.440> plug<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
section but I can't just plug this in it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.430 
section but I can't just plug this in it
won't<00:02:45.340> be<00:02:45.550> as<00:02:45.850> revealing<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.960> front<00:02:47.230> looks

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
won't be as revealing on the front looks

won't be as revealing on the front looks
fantastic<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.700> think<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.360> should<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.570> very

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.950 
the amazing spider-man classics venom so
yeah<00:04:42.340> he's<00:04:42.520> nowhere<00:04:42.729> near<00:04:42.909> being<00:04:43.360> as<00:04:43.569> tall<00:04:43.840> as

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
yeah he's nowhere near being as tall as

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.600 
yeah he's nowhere near being as tall as
probably<00:04:44.349> most<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.830> Venom's<00:04:45.159> except

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
probably most of the Venom's except

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.760 
probably most of the Venom's except

agents so bring this review to a close I
would<00:04:47.919> recommend<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.490> if<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.669> want<00:04:48.849> to<00:04:48.909> finish

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
would recommend it if you want to finish

our<00:04:49.360> Hobgoblin<00:04:49.960> build<00:04:50.139> a<00:04:50.229> figure<00:04:50.409> other<00:04:51.189> than

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
our Hobgoblin build a figure other than

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.499 
our Hobgoblin build a figure other than
that<00:04:51.490> if<00:04:51.610> you<00:04:51.669> have<00:04:51.759> like<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:52.030> morris<00:04:52.300> lights

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
that if you have like the morris lights

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.969 
that if you have like the morris lights
and<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.719> don't<00:04:52.870> feel<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.199> in<00:04:53.289> this<00:04:53.560> less

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
and you don't feel like it in this less

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.070 
and you don't feel like it in this less
detailed<00:04:54.580> action<00:04:55.449> figure<00:04:55.689> then<00:04:55.840> I'll<00:04:55.960> go

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
detailed action figure then I'll go

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.330 
detailed action figure then I'll go
ahead<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.379> pass<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.740> cuz<00:04:56.860> there's<00:04:57.039> nothing

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
ahead and pass it cuz there's nothing

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.820 
ahead and pass it cuz there's nothing
too<00:04:57.550> special<00:04:57.879> but<00:04:58.270> myself<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.379> didn't<00:04:59.560> want<00:04:59.710> to

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
too special but myself I didn't want to

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.929 
too special but myself I didn't want to
buy<00:04:59.919> the<00:04:59.979> marks<00:05:00.340> light<00:05:00.460> because<00:05:00.639> I'd<00:05:00.729> much

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
buy the marks light because I'd much

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.399 
buy the marks light because I'd much
rather<00:05:00.969> prefer<00:05:01.300> having<00:05:01.780> an<00:05:01.900> articulated

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
rather prefer having an articulated

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.950 
rather prefer having an articulated
figure<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.009> I<00:05:03.490> probably<00:05:04.120> do<00:05:04.360> have<00:05:04.509> some<00:05:04.659> ideas

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
figure and I probably do have some ideas

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.390 
figure and I probably do have some ideas
for<00:05:05.110> some<00:05:05.259> stop-motion<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:05.949> they'll<00:05:06.069> be<00:05:06.219> like

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
for some stop-motion but they'll be like

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.240 
for some stop-motion but they'll be like
probably<00:05:06.639> too<00:05:06.909> far<00:05:07.180> ahead<00:05:07.650> from<00:05:08.650> this<00:05:08.830> points

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
probably too far ahead from this points

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.159 
probably too far ahead from this points
or<00:05:09.400> where<00:05:09.550> I'm<00:05:09.639> at<00:05:09.789> right<00:05:09.819> now<00:05:09.969> but<00:05:10.930> anyway

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
or where I'm at right now but anyway

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.930 
or where I'm at right now but anyway
this<00:05:11.439> is<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.650> barely<00:05:12.069> passable<00:05:12.400> figure<00:05:12.759> he's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
this is a barely passable figure he's

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.850 
this is a barely passable figure he's
really<00:05:13.270> good<00:05:13.479> he's<00:05:13.960> not<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.259> worst<00:05:14.469> of<00:05:14.710> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
really good he's not the worst of the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.129 
really good he's not the worst of the
way<00:05:15.039> of<00:05:15.219> I<00:05:15.310> think<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:16.090> is<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.419> see<00:05:16.719> later<00:05:17.020> on

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
way of I think that is to see later on

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.920 
way of I think that is to see later on
but<00:05:18.039> anyway<00:05:18.310> after<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.669> spider-man<00:05:19.000> 2099<00:05:19.180> is

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
but anyway after this spider-man 2099 is

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.300 
but anyway after this spider-man 2099 is
next<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:20.560> figure<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.949> woody<00:05:21.129> for

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
next and that is a figure of a woody for

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.930 
next and that is a figure of a woody for
so<00:05:21.490> long

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
so long

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.640 
so long
yeah<00:05:22.479> the<00:05:22.659> probably<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.020> biggest<00:05:23.289> figure

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
yeah the probably the biggest figure

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.540 
yeah the probably the biggest figure
that<00:05:23.740> I've<00:05:23.830> been<00:05:23.889> waiting<00:05:24.009> for<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:24.370> whole

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
that I've been waiting for this whole

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.550 
that I've been waiting for this whole
wave<00:05:24.729> so<00:05:25.030> season<00:05:25.810> for<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.110> doesn't<00:05:26.469> go

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
wave so season for that doesn't go

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.949 
wave so season for that doesn't go
better
