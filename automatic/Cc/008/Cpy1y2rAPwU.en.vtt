 attractive on this border for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.940
 families who like to visit the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.800
 ricard owner of the resort 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.890
 indicated that people will enjoy 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 to meet coconut a tigress of seven 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.260
 months already I give a tiger of a year of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.260
 age 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.840
 they are very playful they are like a child 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.360
 they eat and play and they sleep they love the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.340
 water as you can see them unlike 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.620
 of the other felines 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 and included in the water as part of its 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.010
 habitat 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.500
 to graph he pointed out that tigers are 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 felines that require different care 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.140
 and a lot of training with activities 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.500
 daily physicals very playful but of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.390
 a temperament within what fits 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 gentle a character a good character 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.800
 see nothing more as how they play but 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.740
 Well obviously we do not take it out when 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.250
 there is public in is generally in the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.259
 mornings monday tuesday wednesday and thursday 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.259
 and every time there is time we give them their 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.259
 pass 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.500
 He highlighted the opportunity that the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 attendees breaking the barrier of 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.070
 fear when they dare to live with 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.070
 those wild animals 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.749
 enchanted people never thought that a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.319
 feline had not seen the kind part 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:42.179
 of a feline and it's very beautiful when 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.609
 play with them or when you caress them 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.689
 when they have that approach really 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.789
 they are surprised because they think that 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.490
 they go with them and they are going to eat them 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.140
 it's like that 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 so then very nice answer for 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.290

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 safari 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.350

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.510
