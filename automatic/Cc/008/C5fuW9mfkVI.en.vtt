00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.850
 so in the wardrobe I have not enough 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.610
 Anywhere, pray to work. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 from morning to say I spent the night to talk 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 I think they say do not play wildcard 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 with whom you will love the theme then 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 today back prejudice issue in jeans 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 with jeans there are people who find it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.160
 like is old and is not is a super thing 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 new super modern and that leaves beautiful 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.770
 look 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 So today's theme of our duel is going 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 to be wearing totally jeans 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.990
 People are going to choose which one to stay. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 ninth best agent you only at home is 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.130
 I think I should mix prints 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.250
 It can be very interesting. 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.220
 several pants not because it depends on what 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:47.590
 we will use up as had 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.590
 What did you have on Carlin? 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.500
 So beautiful, you swept you too. 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.950
 I really liked your 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.320
 so I bet on the mix of prints 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.570
 I like a more fashionista look 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.930
 small business and logistics business 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.800
 and the times between that year in the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.290
 Now I play as 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.470
 length of the size difference I 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.690
 I'm wearing a very short, feminine shorts. 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.510
 Who has a beach and put on a shirt? 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.670
 more masculine is actually fulfilling 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.990
 your part to leave only part of the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.850
 my body shows 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.250
 there is a work that I can use of 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.020
 day with a sandal with the accessory 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.250
 Lightest night I put one. 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.040
 high sandal 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.640
 the most glamorous accessories schoolgirl 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.160
 randon did you like it for sure 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.989
 like those which fear it as 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.590
 You identified because we here 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.959
 find everyone already thinks there is something 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.640
 You certainly do not vote there. 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.640
 I'm curious, I really liked it.
