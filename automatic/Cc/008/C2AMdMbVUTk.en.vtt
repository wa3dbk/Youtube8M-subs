00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
strategy on this map that that's down

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.990 
strategy on this map that that's down
over<00:03:00.860> there<00:03:00.980> by<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.160> pack<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> punch<00:03:01.790> that's

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
over there by the pack a punch that's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.360 
over there by the pack a punch that's
also<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> great<00:03:02.750> strategy<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.620> one<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:04.160> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
also a great strategy this one is a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.569 
also a great strategy this one is a
couple<00:03:04.610> seconds<00:03:05.060> faster<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.570> timed<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.310> at<00:03:07.310> I'm

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
couple seconds faster I timed it at I'm

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.699 
couple seconds faster I timed it at I'm
doing<00:03:07.790> about<00:03:08.000> 4<00:03:08.269> or<00:03:08.299> 5<00:03:08.390> times<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.170> every<00:03:09.680> time

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
doing about 4 or 5 times and every time

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.920 
doing about 4 or 5 times and every time
this<00:03:10.070> one<00:03:10.220> was<00:03:10.370> faster<00:03:10.609> I<00:03:11.060> liked<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.750> one

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.699 
also because you're right here by your
quick<00:03:13.910> revive<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.049> way<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.470> get<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
quick revive so that way if you get a

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.500
