00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hello I'm Ben Miller an orthopedic tumor

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.260 
hello I'm Ben Miller an orthopedic tumor
surgeon<00:00:08.100> here<00:00:08.280> at<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> University<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.910> Iowa

surgeon here at the University of Iowa

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.879 
surgeon here at the University of Iowa
I'm<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> talk<00:00:10.290> today<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.530> little<00:00:10.770> bit

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
I'm going to talk today a little bit

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
I'm going to talk today a little bit
about<00:00:11.280> limb<00:00:11.850> Salvage<00:00:12.270> surgery<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.049> sarcoma

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
about limb Salvage surgery and sarcoma

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
about limb Salvage surgery and sarcoma
and<00:00:13.740> specifically<00:00:14.369> sarcoma<00:00:14.850> bone<00:00:15.209> now<00:00:16.139> when

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and specifically sarcoma bone now when

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.140 
and specifically sarcoma bone now when
we<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.440> about<00:00:16.800> surgery<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.520> sarcoma<00:00:17.880> we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
we think about surgery for sarcoma we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
we think about surgery for sarcoma we
really<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.869> major<00:00:19.170> goals<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
really have two major goals one is to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.330 
really have two major goals one is to
remove<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.119> entire<00:00:21.210> tumor<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.019> two<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
remove the entire tumor and two is to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
remove the entire tumor and two is to
preserve<00:00:23.820> limb<00:00:24.150> function<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.810> much<00:00:25.019> as

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
preserve limb function as much as

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.220 
preserve limb function as much as
possible<00:00:26.150> now<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> way<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> go<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.990> doing

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
possible now the way we go about doing

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.669 
possible now the way we go about doing
this<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> determine<00:00:29.789> where<00:00:30.199> in<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this first is to determine where in the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.220 
this first is to determine where in the
bone<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.490> tumor<00:00:32.759> actually<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.330> now<00:00:33.990> if<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
bone the tumor actually is now if you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.990 
bone the tumor actually is now if you
look<00:00:34.380> back<00:00:34.530> 30<00:00:34.770> years<00:00:35.100> ago<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.579> treatment<00:00:35.970> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
look back 30 years ago the treatment of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
look back 30 years ago the treatment of
sarcoma<00:00:36.450> essentially<00:00:37.050> consisted<00:00:37.710> entirely

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
sarcoma essentially consisted entirely

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
sarcoma essentially consisted entirely
of<00:00:38.280> amputation<00:00:39.060> so<00:00:39.720> what's<00:00:39.900> changed<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of amputation so what's changed in the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.320 
of amputation so what's changed in the
last<00:00:40.530> thirty<00:00:40.860> years<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.490> now<00:00:41.670> we're<00:00:41.910> able<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
last thirty years that now we're able to

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.300 
last thirty years that now we're able to
do<00:00:42.690> limb<00:00:42.930> Salvage<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> essentially<00:00:43.890> 95

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
do limb Salvage and essentially 95

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.280 
do limb Salvage and essentially 95
percent<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:44.820> cases<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.900> one<00:00:46.080> thing

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
percent of these cases well one thing

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.930 
percent of these cases well one thing
that's<00:00:46.440> changed<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.580> better

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that's changed is now we have better

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
that's changed is now we have better
treatments<00:00:48.240> other<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.900> surgery<00:00:49.080> meaning<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
treatments other than surgery meaning we

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
treatments other than surgery meaning we
have<00:00:49.890> chemotherapy<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.850> occasional

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
have chemotherapy and occasional

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.090 
have chemotherapy and occasional
circumstances<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> radiation<00:00:52.890> therapy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
circumstances we have radiation therapy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.820 
circumstances we have radiation therapy
this<00:00:54.030> allows<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.510> tumor<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:54.900> stop<00:00:55.140> growth<00:00:55.470> it

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
this allows the tumor to stop growth it

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.140 
this allows the tumor to stop growth it
defines<00:00:56.130> our<00:00:56.310> boundaries<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.790> little<00:00:57.030> bit

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
defines our boundaries a little bit

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150 
defines our boundaries a little bit
better<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:57.960> allows<00:00:58.140> us<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.620> closer<00:00:58.860> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
better and it allows us to be closer to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
better and it allows us to be closer to
the<00:00:59.280> tumor<00:00:59.610> without<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.120> much<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the tumor without so much of a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.960 
the tumor without so much of a
consequence<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> local<00:01:01.470> recurrence<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.160> second

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
consequence of local recurrence a second

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.759 
consequence of local recurrence a second
thing<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.240> changed<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.810> now<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.350> MRI

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
thing that's changed is now we have MRI

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
thing that's changed is now we have MRI
to<00:01:04.920> help<00:01:05.280> us<00:01:05.430> tell<00:01:05.670> where<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.150> tumor<00:01:06.450> starts

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to help us tell where the tumor starts

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
to help us tell where the tumor starts
and<00:01:07.020> stops<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.730> this<00:01:08.850> diagram

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and stops and if we go to this diagram

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
and stops and if we go to this diagram
of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> bone<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.140> imagine<00:01:10.440> if<00:01:10.800> we<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of the bone you can imagine if we have a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
of the bone you can imagine if we have a
tumor<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.730> here<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.840> x-ray

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
tumor down here that we can see on x-ray

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
tumor down here that we can see on x-ray
we<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.830> big<00:01:14.100> question<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.420> does<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
we have a big question of where does the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
we have a big question of where does the
tumor<00:01:16.050> extend<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> bone<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.850> know

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
tumor extend in the bone we don't know

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.670 
tumor extend in the bone we don't know
exactly<00:01:18.120> where<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.780> starts<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.440> where<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
exactly where it starts and where it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.230 
exactly where it starts and where it
stops

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
stops

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.780 
stops
what<00:01:21.240> MRI<00:01:21.600> allows<00:01:21.870> us<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.620> is<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.550> allows<00:01:23.580> us

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
what MRI allows us to do is it allows us

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.970 
what MRI allows us to do is it allows us
to<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.570> greater<00:01:24.900> detail<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
to see in greater detail what is

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.280 
to see in greater detail what is
happening<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> tumor<00:01:26.909> itself<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.990> high

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
happening in the tumor itself how high

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
happening in the tumor itself how high
up<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.010> leg<00:01:29.670> does<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.600> inside<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
up the leg does it go on the inside of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170 
up the leg does it go on the inside of
the<00:01:31.170> bone<00:01:31.350> where<00:01:32.159> does<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> extend<00:01:32.730> on<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the bone where does it extend on the

the bone where does it extend on the
outside<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.750> bone<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.770> additional

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
outside of bone and this additional

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.550 
outside of bone and this additional
information<00:01:35.460> gives<00:01:36.270> us<00:01:36.510> enough<00:01:37.020> confidence

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
information gives us enough confidence

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.640 
information gives us enough confidence
that<00:01:38.220> we're<00:01:38.370> able<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.880> perform<00:01:39.330> surgery<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that we're able to perform surgery to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.930 
that we're able to perform surgery to
actually<00:01:41.130> excise<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:42.659> element<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> bone

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
actually excise this element of the bone
