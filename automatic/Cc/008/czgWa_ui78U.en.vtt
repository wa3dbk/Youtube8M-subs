00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:18.569 
and the idea is that we're going to take

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:20.809 
and the idea is that we're going to take
a<00:00:18.630> bamboo<00:00:19.289> core<00:00:19.650> right<00:00:20.159> here<00:00:20.429> that<00:00:20.550> little

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:20.819 
a bamboo core right here that little

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.429 
a bamboo core right here that little
square<00:00:21.089> you<00:00:21.269> see<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.749> there<00:00:21.899> and<00:00:22.079> we're

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
square you see right in there and we're

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.169 
square you see right in there and we're
going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> cover<00:00:22.829> that<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.249> Burch<00:00:23.550> Burch<00:00:23.909> is

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
going to cover that with Burch Burch is

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.659 
going to cover that with Burch Burch is
a<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.779> hard<00:00:25.140> wood<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.189> don't<00:00:26.399> see

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
a very hard wood that you don't see

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.839 
a very hard wood that you don't see
that's<00:00:27.419> made<00:00:27.749> out<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.529> reason<00:00:28.979> being<00:00:29.130> it's

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that's made out of the reason being it's

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
that's made out of the reason being it's
very<00:00:30.509> hard<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> great<00:00:31.589> but<00:00:32.220> it's<00:00:32.369> very

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
very hard which is great but it's very

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000 
very hard which is great but it's very
heavy<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.539> is<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.079> great<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.769> if<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
heavy which is not so great but if we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.369 
heavy which is not so great but if we
combine<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.699> laminate<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.539> this

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
combine it and laminate it with this

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.860 
combine it and laminate it with this
lightweight<00:00:37.710> bamboo<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:39.089> what<00:00:39.300> we've<00:00:39.449> got<00:00:39.629> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
lightweight bamboo now what we've got is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.680 
lightweight bamboo now what we've got is
a<00:00:40.170> surface<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.039> really<00:00:41.550> hear<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> really

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
a surface you can really hear and really

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.709 
a surface you can really hear and really
feel<00:00:42.960> some<00:00:43.170> pop<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.059> idea<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
feel some pop off of and the idea of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.169 
feel some pop off of and the idea of
holding<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.589> back<00:00:46.800> together<00:00:47.249> on<00:00:47.519> those

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
holding that back together on those

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.479 
holding that back together on those
borderline<00:00:48.600> hits<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.679> borderline<00:00:50.039> myth

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
borderline hits those borderline myth

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
borderline hits those borderline myth
hits<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.839> end<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.890> handle

hits off of the end off of the handle

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.720 
hits off of the end off of the handle
the<00:00:53.789> idea<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.449> real<00:00:54.719> simple<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.710> expensive<00:00:56.640> as

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the idea is real simple as expensive as

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
the idea is real simple as expensive as
