00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:19.099
 We are living a time that the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:22.630
 The Bible calls the last days 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.160
 but when they started these last days 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.279
 according to the best interpreters of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.660
 God's word 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.840
 they started the pentecost is the time 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.829
 of the end 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.720
 in the last few days but some things that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.900
 are sinking landu and the latter 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.040
 days will come to an end and we are 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.050
 I do not think coffee boils in the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.190
 cauldron 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.100
 the apostle Paul uses an expansion of 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 death chapter 4 versus 1 and says the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 spirit expressly states that in the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:18.380
 some times after treating the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:24.229
 faith and what we have witnessed today is 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:31.690
 exactly this aspect of the apostasy that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:36.500
 after the heartburn is the church in her show 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:42.799
 received a huge number of people this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.760
 started back there 19th century when some 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.409
 especially charles finem 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.700
 he started making appeals an appeal 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.799
 for the sinner to accept Jesus 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.020
 this is not in the bible 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.560
 it made you decide to and then 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.930
 you make a decision you go ahead 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.770
 you 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:17.980
 take this position of accepting jesus 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:25.240
 only that there was no transformation 99 in the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:30.910
 birth was only an adherence to a 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.800
 system a philosophy a group and the church 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.980
 in show 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:44.110
 a lot of people people are on top of the soul 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:49.270
 living the soul with feelings in place 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:54.010
 of faith and the church began to be a 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.650
 show to be just a show 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.470
 This has disturbed me greatly in this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 time seeing that many people are 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:08.290
 living on the periphery of the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.850
 experience they are in the church but not 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.299
 are in Christ is not the church 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.840
 it means nothing 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:23.200
 so we need to check this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.000
 spiritual reality if someone is in 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.750
 Christ 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.600
 if anyone is in Christ 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.170
 so is this someone is a new creation 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.060
 in which the old things things 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:47.350
 old the adam things of the old adam 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.260
 already have passed away, behold, things have been done 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.450
 new in Christ so we could 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:59.739
 live a true experience of 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:03.480
 rest of communion with God 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:07.260
 So it's good for us to evaluate a lot. 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.659
 well our experience the apostle paul 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:15.030
 when he is talking about the issue 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:18.780
 of the supper and it says so examine if the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.609
 man is just like that and like this one 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.660
 Paulo 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.669
 when I examine and examine it in the light of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.990
 sacrifice of jesus christ i am 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:37.910
 invited to take a position of entrusting 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.070
 in the sovereignty and omnipotence of God 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.380
 to make a difference in my 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.680
 life 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.650
 One thing, you 're in the church. 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.979
 Other you are in Christ 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.620
 This has to be beaten and repeated. 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:03.120
 because I lived many years in the church 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:07.380
 I was a pastor and I was there doing 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.729
 correct things but I was not between 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.120
 This because in Christ is by faith 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.610
 is to live by faith in the word is a 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.240
 experience of God's revelation to 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.910
 with us and that changes everything 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.849
 If someone is in Christ, he has a new 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.599
 perspective is a new walk 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:36.150
 We always want to touch on this aspect. 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:39.840
 here is why these conversions between 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:44.070
 quotes that many people say have in 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.250
 truth needs to be evaluated so that 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:53.300
 we can understand that he is in Christ 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:59.340
 It's a radical change of life and it's before 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:03.599
 I lived by myself is self - confidence is 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:08.070
 confidence in the system today we trust 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:09.700
 in the sovereignty in power in the grace of Jesus 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.120
 Christ 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.980
 they are different things, it 's not us 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.050
 We would like to be always talking 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:24.490
 timely about this real life 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:26.740
 because many people who are in the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.480
 church are confused 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.110
 sometimes they come to me and what 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.190
 feature of a new creature 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.400
 main characteristic of a new 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.070
 creature that she no longer lives is Christ 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.390
 who lives in her who is no longer she is 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.950
 living and she now has another 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:53.080
 perspective 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:55.150
 It's not me who has to evolve in 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.880
 my sanctification 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.420
 I'm not going to promote because I died 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:09.060
 I am crucified with Christ and do not 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:12.070
 I live a Christian faith and I will not go there any more 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.460
 christ replacement 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.320
 if this has not happened in your life, do not 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.510
 happened in my life 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.080
 we can be inside any 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.840
 system in any philosophy of 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:31.360
 any church but we are not 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:35.050
 Christians are members of a system 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.950
 apostasy arises precisely in this 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.890
 aspect 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.060
 When people come to church, but 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.540
 not in the text 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.800
 think about it because this is fundamental 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.510
 for your experience 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.510
 God bless your life
