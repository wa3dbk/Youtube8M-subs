most of the things you find in stores
are<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.760> speaker<00:01:03.270> units<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
are the just of speaker units with this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.649 
are the just of speaker units with this
built-in<00:01:04.580> not<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> actual<00:01:06.119> adapter<00:01:08.659> well

of this well the thing only runs about

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.060 
of this well the thing only runs about
thirty<00:01:22.950> dollars<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.500> older

goes from your standard 120 volts to
five<00:01:47.579> volts<00:01:50.210> now<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> importance<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.110> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
five volts now the importance of this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.120 
five volts now the importance of this
using<00:01:52.649> five<00:01:52.950> volts<00:01:53.869> has<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.500> using<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
using five volts has to do with using it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.980 
using five volts has to do with using it
in<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> car<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:58.079> take<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> output<00:01:58.500> voltage

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
in a car it can take the output voltage

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
in a car it can take the output voltage
from<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.110> USB<00:02:01.380> car<00:02:01.799> charger<00:02:02.630> okay<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
headphone type jack you plug that in one

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.210 
headphone type jack you plug that in one
on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> left<00:02:32.160> side<00:02:33.500> okay<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.530> now<00:02:34.950> we're<00:02:35.129> going

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
on the left side okay so now we're going

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.750 
on the left side okay so now we're going
to<00:02:35.280> make<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.910> Nano<00:02:36.860> work<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.129> these

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
to make this Nano work with these

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.000 
to make this Nano work with these
speakers<00:02:39.090> real<00:02:39.510> quick<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.860> it's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
speakers real quick so you can see it's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.339 
speakers real quick so you can see it's
not<00:02:41.160> connected<00:02:41.670> anyway<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.239> unit<00:02:42.599> so

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
not connected anyway to the unit so

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.080 
not connected anyway to the unit so
we're<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.739> go<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> settings<00:02:44.430> usually<00:02:44.940> on

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
we're going to go to settings usually on

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.089 
we're going to go to settings usually on
your<00:02:45.120> smartphone<00:02:46.049> or<00:02:46.379> tablet<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.829> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> be

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
your smartphone or tablet is going to be

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.180 
your smartphone or tablet is going to be
under<00:02:47.579> settings<00:02:48.680> then<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.709> go<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> your

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
under settings then you go to your

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.509 
under settings then you go to your
Bluetooth<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:51.510> want<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.750> make<00:02:51.840> sure<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.200> on

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
Bluetooth you want to make sure it's on

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.710 
Bluetooth you want to make sure it's on
and<00:02:53.519> when<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.090> menu<00:02:54.359> that's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
and when you're in that menu that's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.610 
and when you're in that menu that's
usually<00:02:55.290> where<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.220> turns<00:02:56.579> into<00:02:57.620> discoverable

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
usually where it turns into discoverable

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.460 
usually where it turns into discoverable
mode<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:59.010> says<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.459> now<00:03:00.420> discoverable<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
mode it says now now discoverable I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890

don't<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.069> read<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> what<00:03:03.870> we

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
don't know if you can read it so what we

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.949 
don't know if you can read it so what we
need<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.709> sync<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.609> two<00:03:06.030> devices<00:03:06.450> we

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
need to do is sync the two devices we

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.580 
need to do is sync the two devices we
need<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.260> push<00:03:07.440> connect<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.099> here<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.440> you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
need to push connect on here and you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250 
need to push connect on here and you
hear<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.799> beep<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.609> speakers<00:03:12.200> now<00:03:13.200> we

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
hear a beep on the speakers now we

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
hear a beep on the speakers now we
should<00:03:13.620> get<00:03:13.799> another<00:03:14.310> one<00:03:14.609> show<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.120> showing

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
should get another one show up showing

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.580 
should get another one show up showing
up<00:03:16.340> okay<00:03:17.630> now<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.959> one<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.290> says<00:03:19.440> not

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
up okay now that's the one it says not

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.610 
up okay now that's the one it says not
paired<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.280> we're<00:03:20.430> going<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.579> click<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:21.620> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
paired so we're going to click that and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.879 
paired so we're going to click that and
you'll<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.819> blinking<00:03:24.030> light<00:03:27.620> now<00:03:28.620> when

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
you'll see the blinking light now when

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.099 
you'll see the blinking light now when
they<00:03:29.010> connect<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:31.769> hear<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> beep<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.549> it

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
they connect you hear a beep and it

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.140 
they connect you hear a beep and it
turns<00:03:34.109> green

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
turns green

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.930 
turns green
so<00:03:36.150> now<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:39.000> music<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.910> put<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
so now just go to your music and put a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:52.810 
so now just go to your music and put a
song<00:03:42.299> on

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.280 

and<00:03:54.080> then<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:56.640> can<00:03:56.820> walk<00:03:57.030> anywhere<00:03:57.690> away<00:03:58.050> and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
and then you can walk anywhere away and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.260 
and then you can walk anywhere away and
it<00:03:58.350> plays<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.160> your<00:04:00.170> speakers<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:02.270> it's

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
it plays right on your speakers and it's

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.590 
it plays right on your speakers and it's
pretty<00:04:03.510> easy<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:04.580> now<00:04:05.580> on<00:04:05.790> older<00:04:06.120> hi-fi

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
pretty easy to do now on older hi-fi

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.240 
pretty easy to do now on older hi-fi
systems<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.290> stuff<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.950> you'll

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
systems and stuff like that you'll

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.180 
systems and stuff like that you'll
probably<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> red<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.030> white<00:04:09.860> RCA<00:04:10.860> type

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
probably have the red and white RCA type

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.570 
probably have the red and white RCA type
inputs<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:12.000> look<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.110> our<00:04:13.200> auxiliary<00:04:13.710> in<00:04:14.130> or

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
inputs just look for our auxiliary in or

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.800 
inputs just look for our auxiliary in or
line<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:16.410> plug<00:04:16.799> those<00:04:17.790> into<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.480> then

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
line in then plug those into that then

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.690 
line in then plug those into that then
the<00:04:19.380> other<00:04:19.530> side<00:04:19.860> of<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.100> cord<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.549> comes

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
the other side of that cord that comes

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.750 
the other side of that cord that comes
with<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> unit<00:04:21.390> turns<00:04:21.720> into<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.760> 3.5

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760
