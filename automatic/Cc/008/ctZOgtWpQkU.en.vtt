into the Midwest called broaden horizons
makes<00:00:49.770> several<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.640> versions<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.289> no

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
makes several different versions now no

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.600 
makes several different versions now no
matter<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.219> unless<00:00:53.430> you're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
matter where you get them unless you're

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
matter where you get them unless you're
inventing<00:00:54.000> them<00:00:54.090> yourself<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:55.100> costly

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
inventing them yourself they are costly

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
inventing them yourself they are costly
all<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.239> joy<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> playing<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> Wii

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
all right but the joy of playing the Wii

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
all right but the joy of playing the Wii
game<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.739> completely<00:00:59.190> outweigh<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.940> but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
game can completely outweigh that but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.790 
game can completely outweigh that but
again<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> understand<00:01:01.649> exactly

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
again you want to understand exactly

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709 
again you want to understand exactly
where<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.489> physical<00:01:02.879> limitations<00:01:03.270> go

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
where your physical limitations go

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
where your physical limitations go
because<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.650> everything<00:01:04.860> from<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
because they have everything from a a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
because they have everything from a a
silicon<00:01:06.990> type<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> makes<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> hold

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
silicon type thing that makes you hold

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
silicon type thing that makes you hold
the<00:01:08.909> rete<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> Wii<00:01:09.600> Remote<00:01:09.990> very

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the rete with the Wii Remote very

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.740 
the rete with the Wii Remote very
similar<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> traditional

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
similar to you did with the traditional

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
similar to you did with the traditional
remote<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.010> step<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
remote and that's the first step if you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
remote and that's the first step if you
have<00:01:14.610> limited<00:01:15.030> motion<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.229> Wii<00:01:16.409> also

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
have limited motion you the Wii also

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.210 
have limited motion you the Wii also
allows<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> old<00:01:17.490> both<00:01:17.939> wireless<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> wired
