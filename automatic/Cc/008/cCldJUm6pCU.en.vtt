white and haven't got any sort of labels

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.620 
white and haven't got any sort of labels
that<00:02:10.690> say<00:02:10.720> radii<00:02:11.320> on<00:02:11.590> them<00:02:11.770> but<00:02:12.300> really<00:02:13.300> really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
that say radii on them but really really

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.470 
that say radii on them but really really
simple<00:02:13.810> last<00:02:14.680> latest<00:02:15.130> sort<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.820> medium<00:02:16.210> thick

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
simple last latest sort of medium thick

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.700 
simple last latest sort of medium thick
so<00:02:17.410> I'll<00:02:17.740> show<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.070> what<00:02:18.370> they<00:02:18.520> look<00:02:18.550> like

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
so I'll show you what they look like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so I'll show you what they look like
this<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.920> sort<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.880> main<00:02:22.060> shoe<00:02:22.780> bit<00:02:23.730> it's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
this is the sort of main shoe bit it's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.080 
this is the sort of main shoe bit it's
like<00:02:25.720> an<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:26.050> black<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.740> then<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.980> white<00:02:27.220> soul

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
like an all black and then a white soul

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.320 
like an all black and then a white soul
and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.080> goes<00:02:29.170> back<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.590> black<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.330> it's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and then it goes back to black and it's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.840 
and then it goes back to black and it's
got<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.720> strap<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.920> front<00:02:33.190> which<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.670> I

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
got a strap on the front which is I

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.550 
got a strap on the front which is I
think<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.180> really<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.720> cool<00:02:34.870> design<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
think it's really really cool design and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.460 
think it's really really cool design and
that's<00:02:36.490> partly<00:02:36.820> why<00:02:36.970> i<00:02:37.000> got<00:02:37.270> them<00:02:37.510> because<00:02:38.350> i

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that's partly why i got them because i

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.900 
that's partly why i got them because i
actually<00:02:38.590> saw<00:02:38.980> them<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.430> i<00:02:39.459> think<00:02:39.700> it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
actually saw them on i think it's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720 
actually saw them on i think it's
plunder<00:02:40.390> or<00:02:40.540> karmaloop<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:41.920> just<00:02:42.489> ran

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
plunder or karmaloop but they just ran

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.670 
plunder or karmaloop but they just ran
out<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.180> my<00:02:43.720> size<00:02:43.959> before<00:02:44.230> i<00:02:44.410> was<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.650> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
out of my size before i was going to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770 
out of my size before i was going to
order<00:02:44.860> them<00:02:45.100> which<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.400> really<00:02:45.610> annoying<00:02:45.850> but

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
order them which is really annoying but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.270 
order them which is really annoying but
i<00:02:46.810> got<00:02:47.020> them<00:02:47.170> from<00:02:47.320> dr.<00:02:47.620> J's<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:48.130> weren't

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
i got them from dr. J's and they weren't

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.760 
i got them from dr. J's and they weren't
that<00:02:48.459> much<00:02:48.580> more<00:02:48.850> expensive<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:50.440> they<00:02:50.530> cost

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
that much more expensive think they cost

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
that much more expensive think they cost
me<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:51.070> 40<00:02:51.760> pounds<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:54.310> was<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.550> sale

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
me about 40 pounds and that was on sale

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.870 
me about 40 pounds and that was on sale
because<00:02:55.180> they<00:02:55.720> meant<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> retail<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.650> about

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
because they meant to retail for about

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.380 
because they meant to retail for about
65<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.840> think<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.470> really<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.890> cool

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
65 so I think it's really really cool

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.280 
65 so I think it's really really cool
again<00:03:01.390> I've<00:03:01.510> got<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> strap<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:02.170> got

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
again I've got the strap and it's got

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.220 
again I've got the strap and it's got
some<00:03:02.440> details<00:03:02.800> on<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.330> different<00:03:04.330> materials<00:03:04.900> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
some details on it different materials I

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.740 
some details on it different materials I
think<00:03:05.680> it's<00:03:05.830> sort<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.100> fake<00:03:06.340> leather<00:03:06.640> or<00:03:07.030> might

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
think it's sort of fake leather or might

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.530 
think it's sort of fake leather or might
be<00:03:07.870> real<00:03:08.049> I'm<00:03:08.260> not<00:03:08.410> sure<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.330> bit

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
be real I'm not sure and this bit

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.630 
be real I'm not sure and this bit
actually<00:03:10.900> came<00:03:11.320> with<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> metal<00:03:12.280> spoon

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
actually came with like a metal spoon

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually came with like a metal spoon
and<00:03:13.360> obviously<00:03:13.600> right<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.080> there<00:03:14.410> should

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and obviously right there there should

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.320 
and obviously right there there should
be<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.680> spoon<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.250> broke<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.150> not<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
be a spoon but it broke it's not that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.990 
be a spoon but it broke it's not that
important<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.080> was<00:03:17.260> quite<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> cool<00:03:18.160> sort<00:03:18.850> of

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
important it was quite a cool sort of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.190 
important it was quite a cool sort of
average<00:03:19.299> extra<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.489> their<00:03:21.959> detail<00:03:22.959> that

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
average extra I like their detail that

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.310 
average extra I like their detail that
they've<00:03:23.320> added<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:25.060> sort<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> mesh

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
they've added to it I sort like a mesh

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.810 
they've added to it I sort like a mesh
on<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.239> front<00:03:29.130> sight<00:03:30.130> breathability

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
on this on the front sight breathability

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.289 
on this on the front sight breathability
or<00:03:31.180> whatever<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> way

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
or whatever I like the I like the way

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.690 
or whatever I like the I like the way
it's<00:03:34.630> not<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:35.140> not<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.560> massively<00:03:36.400> high

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's not it's not like a massively high

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.050 
it's not it's not like a massively high
top<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:38.530> think<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.280> looks<00:03:39.489> really<00:03:39.580> really

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
top but I think it looks really really

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.280 
top but I think it looks really really
cool<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.560> other<00:03:41.709> side<00:03:41.920> obviously<00:03:42.100> and
