when you create a world and you hold

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630 
when you create a world and you hold
down<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.570> shift<00:00:21.600> key<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.340> through

down the shift key and you go through
them<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> new

go ahead and create it what this is is a
world<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.619> mainly<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.550> creating<00:00:33.090> resource

every rotation and all this is there all

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
every rotation and all this is there all
blocks<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.340> they're<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.879> invisible

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
blocks but they're all just invisible

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
blocks but they're all just invisible
blocks<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> blocks<00:01:05.519> over

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
blocks we do have all of the blocks over

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
blocks we do have all of the blocks over
here<00:01:06.299> still<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
here still and you can see that there is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
here still and you can see that there is
just<00:01:08.549> everything<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.689> redstone<00:01:10.170> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
just everything from the redstone in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
just everything from the redstone in
every<00:01:10.680> state<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.310> ladders<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.060> every

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
every state two ladders in every

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.890 
every state two ladders in every
rotation<00:01:13.100> everything<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.540> pretty<00:01:15.540> much<00:01:15.630> just

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
rotation everything is pretty much just

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.830 
rotation everything is pretty much just
laid<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.659> works

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
laid out that you can see if it works

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.859 
laid out that you can see if it works
correctly<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:20.159> resource<00:01:20.610> pack<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
correctly in your resource pack so

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
correctly in your resource pack so
there's<00:01:22.200> other<00:01:22.320> uses<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there's other uses to it but that is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
there's other uses to it but that is
really<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> main<00:01:24.150> reason<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.960> was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
really the main reason that it was

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
really the main reason that it was
released<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.490> other<00:01:27.000> than<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> there

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
released and now other than that there

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
released and now other than that there
is<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.930> new<00:01:28.229> world<00:01:28.590> border<00:01:29.040> command<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
is a new world border command so if we

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
is a new world border command so if we
go<00:01:29.909> ahead<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> set<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> world<00:01:31.680> border<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
go ahead and set the world border to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
go ahead and set the world border to
let's<00:01:33.509> set<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.619> 50<00:01:35.040> let's<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> back

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
let's set it to just 50 let's go back

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.590 
let's set it to just 50 let's go back
over<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
over here and you can see that we have a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
over here and you can see that we have a
small<00:01:39.689> world<00:01:40.259> border<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.829> 50<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> want

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
small world border of 50 now if you want

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.300 
small world border of 50 now if you want
to<00:01:42.299> add<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.259> /<00:01:43.530> world<00:01:43.890> border

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to add to that we can do / world border

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
to add to that we can do / world border
add<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.259> ahead<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.439> add<00:01:46.649> 50<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
add and let's go ahead and add 50 to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
add and let's go ahead and add 50 to
that<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.610> consider<00:01:47.939> expanded<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> world

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that you consider expanded the world

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
that you consider expanded the world
border<00:01:49.380> from<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.250> already<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
border from what it was already at and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
border from what it was already at and
now<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.079> larger<00:01:52.710> world<00:01:52.979> border<00:01:53.490> next

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
now we have a larger world border next

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
now we have a larger world border next
up<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.810> added<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> feature<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> can

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
up they added a feature so that you can

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.510 
up they added a feature so that you can

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
fuel slot of a furnace so an empty

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
fuel slot of a furnace so an empty
bucket<00:02:02.670> has<00:02:03.240> been<00:02:03.540> allowed<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.530> put<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.890> the

fuel slot because if you were to smell a
lava<00:02:07.469> bucket<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.459> leave<00:02:08.640> behind<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
lava bucket it would leave behind this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
lava bucket it would leave behind this

bucket but other than that all fuel is
allowed<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> go<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.959> try<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> put

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
allowed but if you go and try to put

allowed but if you go and try to put
that<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.189> fuel<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.939> will<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.269> allow<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that is not fuel it will not allow you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.839 
that is not fuel it will not allow you
to<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.560> slot<00:02:16.769> but<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> go

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
to put it in the slot but if you go

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.220 
to put it in the slot but if you go
ahead<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.180> try<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.390> smell<00:02:18.840> something

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
ahead and try to smell something

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.809 
ahead and try to smell something
correctly<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.129> see<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.519> still

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
correctly you can see that it still

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.839 
correctly you can see that it still
works<00:02:21.150> fine<00:02:21.329> next<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.409> added<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> /<00:02:23.250> replace

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
works fine next they added the / replace

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.059 
works fine next they added the / replace
item<00:02:24.329> command<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.040> ahead

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
item command so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.860 
item command so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.459> paste<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.329> then<00:02:27.420> explain<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and paste it in here and then explain it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.740 
and paste it in here and then explain it
so<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.439> have<00:02:28.650> /<00:02:29.310> replaced<00:02:29.730> item<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.329> then

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so we have / replaced item and then

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.069 
so we have / replaced item and then
entity<00:02:31.650> or<00:02:31.920> block<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.819> pick<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.599> say

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
entity or block you can pick one so say

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.569 
entity or block you can pick one so say
you<00:02:34.140> want<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.409> replace<00:02:34.620> an<00:02:34.829> item<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.189> a<00:02:35.280> chest

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
you want to replace an item in a chest

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.289 
you want to replace an item in a chest
or<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.909> furnace<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.799> use<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.609> right<00:02:38.939> here

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
or a furnace you can use that right here

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.319 
or a furnace you can use that right here
the<00:02:40.049> entity<00:02:40.439> type<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.310> player<00:02:41.819> and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
the entity type would be a player and

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.530 
the entity type would be a player and
you<00:02:43.079> can<00:02:43.109> set<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.739> type<00:02:44.099> there<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
you can set that type there and then the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020 
you can set that type there and then the
slot<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.109> inventory<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.859> this<00:02:47.159> is<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
slot that inventory and this is the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.119 
slot that inventory and this is the
spots<00:02:48.389> so<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.019> an<00:02:49.139> index<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.769> starts<00:02:50.040> at

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
spots so it is an index so it starts at

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.160 
spots so it is an index so it starts at
zero<00:02:50.400> zero<00:02:51.030> would<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.480> first<00:02:51.750> spot<00:02:52.019> in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
zero zero would be the first spot in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.899 
zero zero would be the first spot in
your<00:02:52.260> inventory<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.400> let's<00:02:53.549> go<00:02:53.670> ahead<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
your inventory so let's go ahead and

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.559 
your inventory so let's go ahead and
replace<00:02:54.170> my<00:02:55.170> item<00:02:55.799> or<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:56.790> inventory<00:02:57.060> with

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
replace my item or my inventory with

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.990 
replace my item or my inventory with
cobblestone<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.889> if<00:02:59.159> we<00:02:59.310> go<00:02:59.459> ahead<00:02:59.790> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
cobblestone so if we go ahead and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.289 
cobblestone so if we go ahead and
replace<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.590> first<00:03:01.889> thing<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.700> cobblestone

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
replace the first thing with cobblestone

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.970 
replace the first thing with cobblestone
I'll<00:03:03.780> actually<00:03:04.109> copy<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.739> show<00:03:04.889> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
I'll actually copy that and show you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.369 
I'll actually copy that and show you
that<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.129> have<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> stone<00:03:05.579> in<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:05.909> right<00:03:06.030> now

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
that I have a stone in here right now

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.990 
that I have a stone in here right now
you<00:03:07.379> can<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.400> cobblestone

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
you can see that now it is cobblestone

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.750 
you can see that now it is cobblestone
we<00:03:09.540> can<00:03:09.689> also<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:10.560> ahead<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.129> let's<00:03:12.030> set<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
we can also go ahead and let's set the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.830 
we can also go ahead and let's set the
fourth<00:03:14.760> slot<00:03:15.090> because<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.389> don't<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.720> has

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
fourth slot because I don't think it has

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.650 
fourth slot because I don't think it has
anything<00:03:16.049> in<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:17.310> stone<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.419> can<00:03:18.540> see

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
anything in there to stone you can see

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.020 
anything in there to stone you can see
it<00:03:18.720> will<00:03:18.810> actually<00:03:18.959> add<00:03:19.310> stone<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.760> my

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it will actually add stone to my

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.119 
it will actually add stone to my
inventory<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:22.169> can<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.500> same<00:03:22.709> thing<00:03:22.980> with

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
inventory you can do the same thing with

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.059 
inventory you can do the same thing with
chests<00:03:23.639> or<00:03:23.819> any<00:03:24.750> other<00:03:24.989> block<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.500> has<00:03:25.829> an

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
chests or any other block that has an

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.580 
chests or any other block that has an
inventory<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.389> do<00:03:27.510> /<00:03:27.720> replace<00:03:28.139> item

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
inventory so if you do / replace item

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.330 
inventory so if you do / replace item
and<00:03:28.769> then<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.760> block<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and then the block and then the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.439 
and then the block and then the
coordinates<00:03:32.819> so<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.269> would<00:03:33.480> do<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.799> x

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
coordinates so you would do like the x

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.979 
coordinates so you would do like the x
y&amp;z<00:03:36.449> coordinates<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.230> say<00:03:38.129> it<00:03:38.310> was<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.579> 40

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
y&amp;z coordinates just say it was like 40

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.969 
y&amp;z coordinates just say it was like 40
50<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.430> 90<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.609> then<00:03:42.599> slot<00:03:43.310> container<00:03:45.530> dot<00:03:46.530> 0

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
50 and 90 and then slot container dot 0

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:52.280 
50 and 90 and then slot container dot 0
and<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.970> block<00:03:48.299> let's<00:03:49.260> say<00:03:49.500> minecraft<00:03:51.290> stone

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
and the block let's say minecraft stone

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.559 
and the block let's say minecraft stone
then<00:03:53.129> it<00:03:53.250> would<00:03:53.400> replace<00:03:53.729> if<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.030> had<00:03:54.209> any<00:03:54.329> block

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
then it would replace if I had any block

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.360 
then it would replace if I had any block
their<00:03:54.780> replace<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.900> stone<00:03:57.900> so

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
their replace it with the stone so

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.129 
their replace it with the stone so
that's<00:03:59.370> basically<00:03:59.639> how<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.569> replace<00:04:00.840> item

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
that's basically how the replace item

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.589 
that's basically how the replace item
works<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.069> would<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.310> better<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.790> something

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
works it would be better in something

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.539 
works it would be better in something
like<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.959> command<00:04:04.379> block<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.280> now

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
like a command block but it is now

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.289 
like a command block but it is now
therefore<00:04:05.909> command<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.930> use<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:08.040> both<00:04:08.519> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
therefore command you use in both the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.379 
therefore command you use in both the
game<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> command<00:04:10.409> block<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:11.489> we<00:04:11.849> also<00:04:12.000> have

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
game or a command block so we also have

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.899 
game or a command block so we also have
some<00:04:12.629> performance<00:04:13.139> optimizations<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.280> there

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
some performance optimizations and there

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.060 
some performance optimizations and there
is<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> rumor<00:04:15.479> that<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.870> removed<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> feature

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
is a rumor that they removed the feature

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.250 
is a rumor that they removed the feature
of<00:04:17.459> OpenGL<00:04:18.239> they<00:04:18.690> haven't<00:04:18.870> removed<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.199> from

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
of OpenGL they haven't removed it from

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.259 
of OpenGL they haven't removed it from
the<00:04:19.349> settings<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.609> doesn't<00:04:20.880> really<00:04:21.000> seem

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
the settings but it doesn't really seem

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.050 
the settings but it doesn't really seem
to<00:04:21.389> do<00:04:21.570> much<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:22.169> never<00:04:22.620> really<00:04:22.889> noticed<00:04:23.070> too

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
to do much I never really noticed too

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.089 
to do much I never really noticed too
much<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> difference<00:04:24.719> with<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.139> or<00:04:25.500> off<00:04:25.529> I

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
much of a difference with it on or off I

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.629 
much of a difference with it on or off I
guess

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
guess

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.420 
guess
just<00:04:26.819> depends<00:04:27.389> on<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:28.259> type<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.590> computer<00:04:29.009> you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
just depends on the type of computer you

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.520 
just depends on the type of computer you
have<00:04:29.460> type<00:04:29.879> of<00:04:29.999> GPU<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.479> have<00:04:30.719> there<00:04:31.379> were

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
have type of GPU you have there were

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.279 
have type of GPU you have there were
some<00:04:31.770> issues<00:04:31.889> with<00:04:32.210> AMD<00:04:33.210> graphics<00:04:33.449> cards<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
some issues with AMD graphics cards and

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.050 
some issues with AMD graphics cards and
OpenGL<00:04:35.159> so<00:04:36.590> hopefully<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.699> either

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
OpenGL so hopefully that is either

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.869 
OpenGL so hopefully that is either
removed<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.779> fixed<00:04:39.810> or<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:41.009> might<00:04:41.400> not<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:41.669> I

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
removed and fixed or it might not be I

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.149 
removed and fixed or it might not be I
don't<00:04:41.999> know<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.569> rumor<00:04:42.949> next<00:04:43.949> thing

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
don't know it's just a rumor next thing

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.230 
don't know it's just a rumor next thing
though<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:45.650> we<00:04:46.650> do<00:04:46.949> have<00:04:47.279> some<00:04:47.819> improved

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
though is that we do have some improved

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.519 
though is that we do have some improved
model<00:04:48.659> format<00:04:49.020> things<00:04:49.229> they've<00:04:49.409> been

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
model format things they've been

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:50.809 
model format things they've been
switching<00:04:49.919> everything<00:04:50.189> over<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.520> these

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
switching everything over to these

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.689 
switching everything over to these
blocks<00:04:51.180> States<00:04:51.629> instead<00:04:52.529> of<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:53.189> old<00:04:53.219> block

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
blocks States instead of the old block

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.679 
blocks States instead of the old block
format<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:55.009> instead<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.069> specifying<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.939> UV

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
format so instead of specifying the UV

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.959 
format so instead of specifying the UV
levels<00:04:57.840> four<00:04:58.169> blocks<00:04:58.379> you<00:04:58.979> can<00:04:59.340> actually

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
levels four blocks you can actually

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.779 
levels four blocks you can actually
choose<00:05:00.900> textures<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.770> be<00:05:01.860> projected<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:02.520> to

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
choose textures to be projected on to

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.559 
choose textures to be projected on to
the<00:05:03.539> block<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:05.189> don't<00:05:05.909> really<00:05:06.120> have<00:05:06.210> any<00:05:06.479> way

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
the block so I don't really have any way

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.110 
the block so I don't really have any way
to<00:05:06.599> demonstrate<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.409> to<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:08.069> but<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:08.939> will

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
to demonstrate this to you but I will

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.730 
to demonstrate this to you but I will
leave<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> link<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> picture<00:05:10.229> that

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
leave a link to a picture that

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.679 
leave a link to a picture that
demonstrates<00:05:11.279> it<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:12.330> can<00:05:12.479> check<00:05:12.629> that

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689 
demonstrates it and you can check that

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.070 
demonstrates it and you can check that
if<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.139> are<00:05:13.169> interested<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.539> lastly<00:05:15.539> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
if you are interested so lastly the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.119 
if you are interested so lastly the
token<00:05:16.560> strange<00:05:17.460> update<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.439> that<00:05:19.439> blocks<00:05:19.830> will

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
token strange update is that blocks will

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.309 
token strange update is that blocks will
no<00:05:20.279> longer<00:05:20.310> talk<00:05:20.969> about<00:05:21.509> you<00:05:21.750> behind<00:05:21.930> your

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
no longer talk about you behind your

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.230 
no longer talk about you behind your
back<00:05:22.439> you<00:05:23.129> can<00:05:23.279> interpret<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:23.759> however<00:05:23.969> you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
back you can interpret that however you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.439 
back you can interpret that however you
would<00:05:24.419> like<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.930> there<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.919> is<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.639> that's<00:05:27.240> it

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
would like and there it is so that's it

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.899 
would like and there it is so that's it
