00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.149
 hello let's talk about the logitech keyboard 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.550
 g19 is worth a pretty curious keyboard 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.679
 It has many functions on everything that 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.389
 It draws attention is the issue of 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.270
 screen that we have here on the own 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.090
 keyboard that will enable us to launch 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.430
 diverse applications and other good the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.530
 keyboard to start is a pretty keyboard 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.360
 quite large by the subject of 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.240
 the function keys that we have 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.010
 here the keys that the whole theme of the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.010
 upper keys to control the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.510
 screen now we will see it worth this that 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 is to raise the volume of the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.330
 computer mute or multimedia buttons 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.120
 advance back whatever it is worth subject 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.730
 of keyboard and normal is not a keyboard 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 mechanical but it's membrane does not 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.910
 a lot of noise that is the advantage 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.469
 and nothing good steps to things to have in 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 account for example we have the keys 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.010
 that they are just macros macros 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.729
 that can serve us well for the subject 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.219
 of video games in this case we have 12 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.350
 We can save on each key various 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.600
 macros to configure with the program 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 that comes directly to us from 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.689
 logitech in the program this then here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.789
 we have the theme of macros worth 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.289
 We have different profiles that even 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.170
 we can download them from the internet 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.659
 with settings already of some game 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.789
 something here and especially 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.319
 good for those of us who use it for 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.409
 office theme you can create a 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.250
 own profile and in these profiles have 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.410
 your keys 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 and one to advance in the web pages 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.990
 to close them the subject of glasses in 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.780
 3d 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.549
 launch the calculator anything 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.310
 you think it's worth here I have all my 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.310
 keys to my taste configured quite 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.950
 simple you can put anything 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 launch applications whatever there are three 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.680
 then memory buttons are separate 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 of the 12 keys we have three 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.270
 possibilities three memory blocks 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.520
 with which in the background we have 36 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.640
 36 keys macros 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.610
 it can be quite useful that we have more 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.350
 for example in the application is 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.860
 the theme of the screen that is the most 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.330
 negative is on the screen this you see 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.710
 it goes up and down we have different 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.170
 options me for example that I have 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.430
 configured that always comes out of series 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 is the topic of the news rss is worth me 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 is going to get my news 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.650
 here and see them when you click 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.120
 directly I load them into the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.580
 browser 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.099
 it comes pretty well it 's quite comfortable 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 you can set up newspapers here 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.319
 sources on the internet whatever you want 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.580
 it's worth what else we have so good with this 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.230
 button we can go through the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.349
 applications this are directly 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.739
 videos from youtube internet vale 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.360
 we can watch videos advance the video 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.890
 man is not that it is very logical 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.750
 be watching youtube videos here in 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.430
 the keyboard you see on the computer you can not see 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 nothing but good equal one comes to them 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.030
 all right 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.300
 in this we have the options you know here 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.050
 I can select videos move by 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.050
 various menus 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.870
 it is worth more good stars are 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.440
 course of games 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.270
 this is a viewer of what consumption of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.220
 the ram memory cpu that is spending 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.530
 more things a watch can be 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.170
 configure this for example is a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.940
 movie player that we have in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.020
 the computer we can see here 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.630
 directly a movie 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.480
 beige is pretty fluid is not going 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.280
 nothing 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.540
 you can see the movies either 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.750
 It has a lot of logic but good now 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.230
 some video can be comfortable in 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 sometime 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.840
 what else we have as well the issue of 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.069
 webcam if we have a webcam set 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.629
 directly, because we are seeing each other 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.640
 it is not that it is a useful thing but 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.480
 good for recording issues of 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.299
 Internet or things like that can be 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.470
 useful is always people looking for 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.470
 utilities of these things 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.830
 what about youtube there's really a lot of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.600
 applications that can be deleted 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.030
 to take out and when you load videogames 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.180
 out options leave for example life 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.410
 that you have left a map can come out and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.850
 then there are people who develop 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.650
 applications for example for the theme 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.850
 of spotify and others I can go see 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.880
 here all the songs that I'm going 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.560
 playing forward to edit is worth that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.050
 is the theme of the screen that with this 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.880
 I can unplug it if I do not 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.090
 Interested in this moment but good is 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.180
 a way to stop at night see what 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.590
 better of the keys as you see are 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.900
 backlit now it looks a bit bad 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.850
 for the theme of light but good you see 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.770
 that when I click here I change the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.540
 colors can be set a lot 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.500
 of colors to be for all the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.080
 Voucher keys is quite comfortable for 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.970
 the night over here is good this 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.520
 simply to disable the key 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.190
 windows in video games and such either 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.190
 it's a very useful thing but for gamers 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.660
 sure it suits them very well when you put it 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.840
 the start menu works 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.960
 something like that and walk from here we get the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.240
 start menu is worth things that can 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.040
 be useful that marc go to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.030
 multimedia keys as you see upload 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.860
 volume lower volume is quite useful 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.780
 mute to advance song whatever 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.190
 It works with spotify now is 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.050
 changing songs here and it works 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.670
 perfectly 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.520
 OK 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.650
 It is very comfortable and then well, come on 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.380
 here that has two usb ports for 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.860
 plug what we want and in this case 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.710
 I have the wireless mouse plugged in and 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.450
 over here I have the 3 connection that is 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.430
 to move in three dimensions in 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.010
 applications in google health and others and 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.170
 from another analysis and nothing good from 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.150
 keyboard tell you that's that's pretty 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.410
 expensive for what is a keyboard by the 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.490
 theme of the screen and others but good 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.120
 you can always catch a new one in 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.040
 affects and result turns out to be quite useful 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.920
 especially on the keys that are 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.960
 pretty at hand and good 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.460
 backlight and the screen like 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.010
 we said then the application the 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.840
 own logitech application they have 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.380
 I've been improving a little here you see the subject 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.660
 of the colors can be changed 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.300
 all the keyboard colors pretty 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.370
 comfortable 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.159
 and then that has internal memory that 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.990
 the profiles that I believe I can 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.030
 save the memory of my computer or 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.860
 directly the keyboard memory like this 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.389
 If I change my computer, well, 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.669
 I keep my profiles within the 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:43.020
 keyboard is worth this is the logitech 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:45.930
 g19 I recommend it is pretty good 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.070
 and nothing 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.070
 to enjoy it
