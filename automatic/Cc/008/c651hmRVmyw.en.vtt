00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
down to the review this is so exciting
because<00:00:25.529> he<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.369> amazing<00:00:27.300> player<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.689> play

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
because he was an amazing player to play

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
because he was an amazing player to play
with<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.099> he<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.820> fast<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with now first up he is really fast just

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
with now first up he is really fast just
not<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.900> fast<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.590> would<00:00:31.710> expect<00:00:31.830> him<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
not as fast as you would expect him to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
not as fast as you would expect him to
be<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.239> alright<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.840> he<00:00:34.230> has

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
be but that is alright because he has

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
be but that is alright because he has
amazing<00:00:34.950> dribbling<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> player

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
amazing dribbling and when the player

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
amazing dribbling and when the player
has<00:00:36.510> amazing<00:00:37.350> dribbling<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.520> high

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
has amazing dribbling or really high

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.819 
has amazing dribbling or really high
dribbling<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.719> means<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.590> keep

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
dribbling this means that they will keep

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
dribbling this means that they will keep
the<00:00:41.010> ball<00:00:41.160> much<00:00:41.730> closer<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> their<00:00:42.450> feet<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the ball much closer to their feet and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
the ball much closer to their feet and
that<00:00:43.230> means<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.040> won't<00:00:44.250> run<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.670> fast

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that means that they won't run as fast

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
that means that they won't run as fast
as<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> players<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.899> lower<00:00:46.379> dribbling

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
as the players that have lower dribbling

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
as the players that have lower dribbling
also<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.760> very<00:00:48.210> expensive<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> ps3<00:00:49.500> he

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
also he is very expensive on the ps3 he

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.700 
also he is very expensive on the ps3 he
is<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.480> 5.5<00:00:51.480> million<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.500> I'm

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
is going for 5.5 million and as I'm

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470 
is going for 5.5 million and as I'm
currently<00:00:53.010> speaking<00:00:53.399> he<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.879> probably<00:00:54.149> going

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
currently speaking he is probably going

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840 
currently speaking he is probably going
even<00:00:54.960> higher<00:00:55.170> than<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.699> expect

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
even higher than that so I don't expect

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
even higher than that so I don't expect
him<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.539> down<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:57.989> thinking<00:00:58.680> he<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
him to go down I'm thinking he was just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360 
him to go down I'm thinking he was just
keep<00:00:59.370> rising<00:00:59.670> until<00:01:00.570> he<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> packs<00:01:01.710> now

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
keep rising until he is out of packs now

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
keep rising until he is out of packs now
he<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.699> an<00:01:02.879> awesome<00:01:03.359> dipping<00:01:03.750> longshore<00:01:04.140> and

because<00:02:55.830> with<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> price<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.660> he<00:02:57.780> comes<00:02:58.080> for

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
because with the price that he comes for
I<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.980> he<00:02:59.400> definitely<00:02:59.820> deserves<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.390> but

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I think he definitely deserves it but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.690 
I think he definitely deserves it but
then<00:03:00.780> again<00:03:01.050> he<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.380> very<00:03:01.740> rare<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.370> market

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
then again he is very rare on the market

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.280 
then again he is very rare on the market
you<00:03:02.820> won't<00:03:03.000> find<00:03:03.209> much<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.480> him<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.260> he

you won't find much of him so he

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
you won't find much of him so he
definitely<00:03:04.560> deserves<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.220> price<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.820> he<00:03:06.330> is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
definitely deserves that price and he is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900
