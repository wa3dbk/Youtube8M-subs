all<00:00:01.680> right<00:00:02.040> well<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.399> looking<00:00:03.170> backwards<00:00:04.170> at

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
all right well I'm looking backwards at

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.210 
all right well I'm looking backwards at
some<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:05.009> projects<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.759> did<00:00:06.919> anywhere<00:00:07.919> from

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
some of my projects I did anywhere from

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.320 
some of my projects I did anywhere from
six<00:00:09.000> months<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:10.190> almost<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.370> year<00:00:11.610> ago<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.090> these

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
six months to almost a year ago on these

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.990 
six months to almost a year ago on these
uh<00:00:12.679> homemade<00:00:13.679> batteries<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.549> progression

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
uh homemade batteries in my progression

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.609 
uh homemade batteries in my progression
on<00:00:15.330> these<00:00:15.509> things<00:00:15.719> I'm<00:00:15.990> looking<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.410> what's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
on these things I'm looking at what's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.849 
on these things I'm looking at what's
been<00:00:17.310> laying<00:00:17.550> around<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:18.359> being<00:00:18.630> used<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
been laying around not being used for a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
been laying around not being used for a
number<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.820> months<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.270> seeing<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.750> they're

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
number of months and seeing if they're

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.609 
number of months and seeing if they're
still<00:00:22.320> workable<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:24.480> nine<00:00:25.019> months<00:00:25.500> ago

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
still workable and about nine months ago

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.269 
still workable and about nine months ago
I<00:00:26.010> got<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.580> our<00:00:26.820> ten<00:00:27.119> months<00:00:27.420> ago<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.689> got<00:00:27.930> into

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
I got in our ten months ago I got into

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.939 
I got in our ten months ago I got into
rechargeable<00:00:29.480> batteries<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.750> were<00:00:31.260> using<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
rechargeable batteries that were using a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.880 
rechargeable batteries that were using a
number<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> different<00:00:32.940> elements<00:00:33.440> in<00:00:34.440> them

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
number of different elements in them

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.060 
number of different elements in them
that<00:00:35.340> were<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.760> galvanic<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:37.110> far<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.710> use

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that were not galvanic as far as use

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
that were not galvanic as far as use
them<00:00:38.250> once<00:00:38.489> thrown<00:00:38.850> away<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.649> using<00:00:40.649> very<00:00:40.890> very

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
them once thrown away or using very very

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.590 
them once thrown away or using very very
little<00:00:41.460> let<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> long<00:00:42.120> time<00:00:42.390> but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
little let them go a long time but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.529 
little let them go a long time but
actually<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.320> punch<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.370> him<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.760> power<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
actually had punch to him had power and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
actually had punch to him had power and
they<00:00:46.020> were<00:00:46.079> rechargeable<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.090> using

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
they were rechargeable and I was using

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.500 
they were rechargeable and I was using
lead<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.340> during<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> John<00:00:50.879> Bedini<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
lead and it was during the John Bedini a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.049 
lead and it was during the John Bedini a
crystal<00:00:52.079> battery<00:00:52.440> project<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.760> really

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
crystal battery project that I really

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
crystal battery project that I really
got<00:00:54.210> into<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> pulled<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> bunch<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
got into this and so I pulled a bunch of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
got into this and so I pulled a bunch of
them<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.270> took<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
them out and took a look at them and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
them out and took a look at them and
they<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:59.149> 100%<00:01:00.620> usable<00:01:01.640> after<00:01:02.640> nine<00:01:03.510> months

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
they are 100% usable after nine months

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
they are 100% usable after nine months
of<00:01:04.049> sitting<00:01:04.350> around<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.799> did<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.129> sulfate

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
of sitting around they did not sulfate

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
of sitting around they did not sulfate
they<00:01:06.270> dried<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.869> had<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> add<00:01:07.439> water<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.100> him

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
they dried out I had to add water to him

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
they dried out I had to add water to him
but<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.520> immediately<00:01:08.939> recharged<00:01:09.720> most<00:01:10.650> most

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
but they immediately recharged most most

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
but they immediately recharged most most
of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> ones<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> worked<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.380> have

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of the ones I worked with and I do have

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.539 
of the ones I worked with and I do have
some<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.220> still<00:01:14.970> running<00:01:15.270> non-stop

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
some that are still running non-stop

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
some that are still running non-stop
after<00:01:17.549> many<00:01:17.790> months<00:01:18.060> they're<00:01:18.420> kept<00:01:18.780> wet<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
after many months they're kept wet and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
after many months they're kept wet and
they're<00:01:19.799> being<00:01:19.950> charged<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:20.909> solar<00:01:21.270> energy

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
they're being charged with solar energy

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.660 
they're being charged with solar energy
but<00:01:22.080> anyway<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
but anyway this is one of them and this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
but anyway this is one of them and this
is<00:01:23.880> running<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.299> blocking<00:01:24.780> oscillator<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is running that blocking oscillator that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.249 
is running that blocking oscillator that
I've<00:01:25.830> shown<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.280> many<00:01:26.430> times<00:01:26.759> before<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I've shown in many times before and it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.480 
I've shown in many times before and it's
about<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> volt<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> half<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.880> led

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
about a volt and a half it's led

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.660 
about a volt and a half it's led
Linotype<00:01:32.490> led<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> alum<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.369> middle

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Linotype led with the alum in the middle

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170 
Linotype led with the alum in the middle
and<00:01:36.540> after<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> did<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.350> project<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.759> got

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and after I did that project there I got

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
and after I did that project there I got
to<00:01:39.210> thinking<00:01:39.720> about<00:01:39.810> making<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.740> double<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to thinking about making a double a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
to thinking about making a double a
battery<00:01:41.939> version<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.229> would<00:01:43.350> fit

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
battery version of that that would fit

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.240 
battery version of that that would fit
in<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:43.950> flashlight<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:47.040> on

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
in this little flashlight that I use on

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
in this little flashlight that I use on
the<00:01:47.399> boat<00:01:47.670> around<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> house<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.470> uses

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the boat around the house that just uses

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.819 
the boat around the house that just uses
a<00:01:49.829> double-a<00:01:50.340> battery<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.659> built<00:01:51.990> some

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a double-a battery and I built some

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.840 
a double-a battery and I built some
small<00:01:53.520> ones<00:01:54.020> versions<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.640> would

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
small ones versions of that that would

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
small ones versions of that that would
be<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> size<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> double-a<00:01:58.500> battery

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
be the size of this double-a battery

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.959 
be the size of this double-a battery
that<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.280> fit<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.990> I

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
that would fit in this thing here and I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.080 
that would fit in this thing here and I
dug<00:02:02.969> those<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.130> charged<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.610> using

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
dug those out and charged them up using

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.340 
dug those out and charged them up using
the<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.600> solar<00:02:06.869> charger<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> made

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
the little solar charger that I made

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the little solar charger that I made
here<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.150> they<00:02:10.150> still<00:02:10.420> work<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:12.100> was

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
here and they still work and that was

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.420 
here and they still work and that was
the<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.330> fit<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.660> flashlight<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
the one that fit in the flashlight and I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.630 
the one that fit in the flashlight and I
got<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.760> wet<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:17.020> charged<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.280> solar

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
got it wet and then charged up solar

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.250 
got it wet and then charged up solar
energy<00:02:19.150> let's<00:02:19.510> see<00:02:19.660> if<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.960> put<00:02:20.110> this

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
energy let's see if I can put this

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.950 
energy let's see if I can put this
together<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.240> not<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
together here this does not have the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.810 
together here this does not have the
button<00:02:23.320> cells<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.310> think<00:02:24.610> some

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
button cells in it and I think some

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.370 
button cells in it and I think some
people<00:02:25.180> when<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.480> first<00:02:25.780> did<00:02:25.960> this<00:02:26.020> video

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
people when I first did this video

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.080 
people when I first did this video
thought<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.670> those<00:02:27.760> three

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
thought that this was one of those three

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.250 
thought that this was one of those three
button<00:02:28.420> cell<00:02:28.600> batteries

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
button cell batteries

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.740 
button cell batteries
it<00:02:29.710> runs<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> double-a<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.030> got<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.270> voltage

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
it runs on a double-a it's got a voltage

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.320 
it runs on a double-a it's got a voltage
booster<00:02:31.990> circuit<00:02:32.710> in<00:02:32.860> there<00:02:33.070> it's<00:02:33.760> not<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
booster circuit in there it's not one of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.100 
booster circuit in there it's not one of
those<00:02:34.630> cheap<00:02:35.470> three<00:02:36.130> button<00:02:36.490> cell

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
those cheap three button cell

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.450 
those cheap three button cell

flashlights it's a 1 watt one LED one

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.910 
flashlights it's a 1 watt one LED one
double-a<00:02:42.970> battery<00:02:43.360> but<00:02:44.020> let<00:02:44.380> me<00:02:44.470> show<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> how

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
double-a battery but let me show you how

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.460 
double-a battery but let me show you how
this<00:02:45.070> worked<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:46.600> was<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.990> totally

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this worked this was not totally

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.220 
this worked this was not totally
successful<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.390> moisture<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.170> that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
successful because the moisture in that

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.730 
successful because the moisture in that
battery<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.610> not<00:02:51.910> sealed<00:02:52.590> affected<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
battery it's not sealed affected the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.370 
battery it's not sealed affected the
switch<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.120> really<00:02:55.540> quit<00:02:55.780> using<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
switch on this so I really quit using it

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.460 
switch on this so I really quit using it
in<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.100> flashlight<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:58.390> would<00:02:58.930> take<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.320> out

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
in the flashlight I would take it out

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.860 
in the flashlight I would take it out
when<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.710> wasn't<00:02:59.920> using<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.000> liked<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
when I wasn't using it that I liked the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.800 
when I wasn't using it that I liked the
fact<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.290> after<00:03:02.740> all<00:03:02.950> those<00:03:03.160> months<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.940> could

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
fact that after all those months I could

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.050 
fact that after all those months I could
put<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.050> back<00:03:05.440> on<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.860> solar<00:03:06.160> charger<00:03:06.790> and

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
put that back on that solar charger and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.170 
put that back on that solar charger and
this<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.230> charged<00:03:08.740> up<00:03:08.980> probably<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.670> 15

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
this is charged up probably in 15

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.330 
this is charged up probably in 15
minutes<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> there<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.300> is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
minutes and there it is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.910 
minutes and there it is
and<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:16.510> doesn't<00:03:16.930> run<00:03:17.110> very<00:03:17.320> long<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
and it doesn't run very long the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.600 
and it doesn't run very long the
ampere-hour

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
ampere-hour

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.990 
ampere-hour
rating<00:03:19.210> is<00:03:19.300> not<00:03:19.480> very<00:03:19.750> good<00:03:20.050> at<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.580> like

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
rating is not very good at it but I like

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.530 
rating is not very good at it but I like
the<00:03:22.270> fact<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.840> 15<00:03:23.380> minutes<00:03:23.860> I<00:03:24.510> had<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the fact that in 15 minutes I had a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.080 
the fact that in 15 minutes I had a
battery<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.680> was<00:03:26.800> back<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.520> life<00:03:27.730> after

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
battery that was back to life after

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.650 
battery that was back to life after
sitting<00:03:28.810> for<00:03:29.220> nine<00:03:30.220> months<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:31.290> bag<00:03:33.660> so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
sitting for nine months and a bag so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.350 
sitting for nine months and a bag so
anyway<00:03:35.050> um<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:36.790> say<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.180> was<00:03:37.300> a

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
anyway um I could say that was a

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
anyway um I could say that was a
successful<00:03:38.290> project<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> wanted<00:03:39.670> to

capable of doing real work and like I

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.570 
capable of doing real work and like I
say<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:36.620> thing<00:04:36.830> here<00:04:37.039> takes<00:04:37.310> 30

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
say this this thing here takes 30

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.140 
say this this thing here takes 30
milliamps<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.360> run<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.729> course<00:04:40.970> this

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
milliamps to run it and of course this

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.330 
milliamps to run it and of course this
thing<00:04:41.419> here<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:41.990> flashlight<00:04:42.320> show<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.190> to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
thing here this flashlight show it to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.750 
thing here this flashlight show it to
you<00:04:43.490> again<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:45.289> no<00:04:45.590> wimpy<00:04:46.010> thing<00:04:46.280> either<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
you again it's no wimpy thing either it

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.610 
you again it's no wimpy thing either it
takes<00:04:47.030> quite<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.330> bit<00:04:47.389> of<00:04:47.539> power<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:48.020> make<00:04:48.229> it<00:04:48.260> go

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
takes quite a bit of power to make it go

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210 
takes quite a bit of power to make it go
and<00:04:52.900> again<00:04:53.900> doesn't<00:04:54.169> run<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.530> very<00:04:54.590> long<00:04:54.979> but

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
and again doesn't run it very long but

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.550 
and again doesn't run it very long but
the<00:04:55.340> fact<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.639> it<00:04:55.760> runs<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.210> all<00:04:56.560> was

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
the fact that it runs it at all was

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.340 
the fact that it runs it at all was
quite<00:04:57.919> quite<00:04:58.729> impressive<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.570> anyway<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.320> just

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
quite quite impressive so anyway I just

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.700 
quite quite impressive so anyway I just
wanted<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.949> report<00:05:01.400> back<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.639> these<00:05:02.710> these

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
wanted to report back on these these

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.990 
wanted to report back on these these
homemade<00:05:04.220> batteries<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.060> made<00:05:05.419> that<00:05:07.000> were

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
homemade batteries that I made that were

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.629 
homemade batteries that I made that were
the<00:05:08.979> rechargeable<00:05:09.979> double-a<00:05:11.110> size<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:13.430> were

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
the rechargeable double-a size that were

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.520 
the rechargeable double-a size that were
made<00:05:13.910> with<00:05:14.889> Lana<00:05:15.889> type<00:05:16.190> LED<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.880> was<00:05:17.060> a

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
made with Lana type LED it was a

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.839 
made with Lana type LED it was a
lead-based<00:05:18.849> metal<00:05:19.849> with<00:05:20.620> separator<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.950> the

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
lead-based metal with separator and the

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.670 
lead-based metal with separator and the
lead<00:05:23.419> oxide<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.349> water<00:05:26.229> another<00:05:27.229> one<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
lead oxide and water another one of the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.200 
lead oxide and water another one of the
success<00:05:28.160> stories<00:05:28.690> thanks<00:05:29.690> for<00:05:29.810> watching
