00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.710
 as for friends as been greetings 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.330
 double welcome back to me 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.820
 channel now I bring you what is the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.369
 review of what would be a protector for 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.100
 screen as we can see is very 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.439
 shock resistant is also 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 resistant to falls and good and it's from the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.480
 company and we're going to teach them a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 little more than what the product would be 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 for you to have an idea but 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 first of all I want to show you the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.110
 specifications that they bring as per 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.629
 example one says it 's pretty strong 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 Holds falls also to the touch still 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.850
 being very good and also does not leave us 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.129
 bubbles when we put what is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 the protector clarified what would be 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.469
 touch because although they do not say it 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.360
 specifications may think that no 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.750
 is yes because sometimes the protectors 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.329
 they remove what is a little tact to the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.000
 phone in some times already has 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 gone through that I clarified it as we can 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.570
 see what you always bring the towelette 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.450
 to be able to clean it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 is our phone brings these two 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.840
 stickers that later I'm going to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 say what it is for and also bring what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 it would be the installation is very important 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 read what the installation would be since 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.369
 this type of protectors gets a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 little different from the regular ones so 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 I always say you do not have to read the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 indications but on this one this time yes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.650
 you have to read them well this would be what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 it brings us what would be the box we are going to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.940
 put the box aside and we're going to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.300
 draw what would be the protector as 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.920
 can you really see the protector not what 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.920
 I'm going to get out of here so I can see it a lot 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.590
 better the protector looks pretty double 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.109
 it is but it is not as thick as you can see 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.969
 that's why I clarified the tact 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.829
 here we will see the installation in 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.630
 fast camera for you to give 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.810
 an idea and remember you have to clean it 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.140
 well this is so that it does not affect us 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.240
 and we got dirty the sticker that brought 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.049
 as you can see is to collect the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.599
 hairs the speck and already once we put and 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.640
 which we would align ours is 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.160
 our protector the only thing that there is 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 do is traverse sideways one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.380
 Once someone has aligned forgiveness and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.170
 it would be ready as you can see quite 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.480
 fast and simple really does not have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.489
 bigger thing and here what we do is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.130
 press it to get those 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.829
 bubbles that have not really been left 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.430
 have any and as I say no 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.260
 problem to put it and it is very easy the only thing 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.500
 what you have to do is measure it before 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.530
 put it and as you can see the button is left 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.500
 a little what is inward and is a 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.019
 little hard to access him that's why he's 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 in what is those two stickers so that 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 you can 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.730
 to put it on and so I have a quick access 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 to your phone to the button and really like 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.890
 I told them the colors if you notice 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.290
 there is no problem the touch works 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.260
 quite well even though it is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.880
 giving pretty good protection and what 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.760
 what was this protector saying 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.090
 I liked it because a friend dropped it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.550
 completely the screen did not happen 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.260
 nothing but the protector so good 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.840
 I hope you liked what this is 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.459
