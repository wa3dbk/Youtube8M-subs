00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello live here I was quite 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 often asked if I did not even 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.269
 show can I make this lure 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
 where with curling iron or whatever 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.509
 That's why I thought I show 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 Just do it as I do 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.960
 I already have a bit 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 earlier should get the idea was 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.260
 now what I mean color so 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.340
 I have already started the color 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.990
 to wash out a bit 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.189
 that's why it's just me right now 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.840
 does not know if he is in the camera now 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 can recognize that my own hair 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 here are a bit lighter than that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 extensions so little bit does not complain 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 rum if you a bit in transition 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.149
 but that looks like it was now 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 I no longer intend that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 extensions again wear I wear now 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 extra again for this video shows 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 you then how that works, so think 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.670
 that with the transition then just like that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 a little bit away i'll show you now 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 Just how I do that was me 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 First I solve my time head of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.390
 limp namely need to knot 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 head because it is better for the hair 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.140
 then it does not feel so fast and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.649
 they are not so messy yes 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 then I know all that well you as 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.079
 next i use my polish 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 I always give super ski misere oil 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 before smoothing or curling in front of it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.130
 hair because it's just a heat protection 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 It makes the hair silky smooth 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 supple it's off white water is one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.150
 anti freeze effect almost at and of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.619
 light hair that is great then pack 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.049
 I now here my extensions 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.610
 As you can see I have the paper 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.439
 otten turned that I do then 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.320
 actually always over night so me 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.720
 then always make it a bit firmer 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 purely so I want you to solidify 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.110
 rows then turn on this lot 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.490
 lotte that they'll be there overnight 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.990
 there they are dry in the morning and then 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.420
 Can I use it here? 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.350
 I've got 22 down here right now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.579
 addresses then I usually do about it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.380
 a 3 address 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.320
 and I still believe one more 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.850
 I then make mail address about that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.860
 now am now currently only times when 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.510
 Do not talk so fast to the three adresses 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.690
 otherwise we will not get behind here 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.220
 so yes a 3 address because you also see 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.510
 how I like the inserts with me 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 that's good, often already 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.100
 As you can see, I have mine 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.179
 Do not be curious about doing that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.039
 I mean now I have to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.240
 luck always very wavy partly 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.280
 curly hair structure 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.690
 That's why I do not have so much there 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.660
 do and yes, I have everything behind everything 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.850
 as far as ready clicked now comes 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.010
 up here, the four rats pure 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.470
 and then yes, if I'm already behind 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.090
 finished clips now because the four 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.410
 addresses are the relatively broad tips 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.950
 now into the sides only so 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.930
 a bit easy because I'm the same 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.209
 from the side still firmly knipse one was 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.130
 then stop by the sides again 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.570
 occasionally at jesus for example like that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 because I have a relatively broad head 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.140
 I have to implement that again something 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.220
 you can see that here now I grab 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.050
 Do it from behind again 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.140
 loose and now sits sideways again 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.160
 really pure 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.540
 I was just always after that 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.100
 to mend a bit and 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.790
 look where it still gets space 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.440
 find something else 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.060
 then I start here on the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.519
 right side to the three address the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.700
 I've just left of 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.980
 to use 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
 I have to have more and more hair 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 because I have such a crazy crest 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.780
 have so I generally on the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.070
 the right side has more hair that you have to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.600
 Of course, then synonymous with the extensions 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.269
 should take into account that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.860
 yes, something strange from then I have here 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.769
 a couple of eating as I do 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.180
 now which left by the fact that the 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.590
 crest can sit very deep with me 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.329
 I do not do so much of that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 But I do not have to do it now 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.590
 only two pieces of rain did not go that far 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.790
 I put the front because I have the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.360
 front hair immediately so I lure after 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.769
 turn away back and that's why 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.510
 individual addresses I still have 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.480
 then I always have the sentences where 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.650
 I see that there is need there so where 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.390
 are still gaps where could still one 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.000
 be a bit fuller or sit there 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.400
 I now have a down below where 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.270
 and yes it is with the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.200
 Extensions already 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.750
 finished now I have one here 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.070
 curling iron if someone asks me what 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.960
 that for an ess i had here in so 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.980
 is a comic as silver crest the 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.540
 At some point I think so 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.150
 just brought in the hairdressing 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.730
 some I do not have this way now 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.440
 really what matters to me is 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.970
 that you can adjust the heat that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.840
 if necessary, heat it is cold 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.090
 can adjust 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.000
 because every year is different and thick of the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.770
 Father's for example, has smaller 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 you can not save so hot , for example 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.620
 or we are happy now 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.220
 For example, the thicker one has to do that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.420
 can adjust in any case 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.490
 now I only just behind the 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.900
 still a bit copied and after 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.550
 combed back because I'm such a swirl 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.710
 has and now just do the front 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.110
 lightweight lure pure 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.030
 I'm just doing a little 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.200
 a bit curly know this once 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.820
 because the curls are pretty curious now 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.140
 are small and then just stuck 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.230
 way back that that more or 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.660
 less so a great looser results and 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.910
 in the tips is then a bit loose that 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.040
 I'll do it because it's downstairs 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.900
 yes very relaxed and then it fits 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.840
 just better in the overall picture of one 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.070
 the skin is almost natural 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.050
 lure it is so they me 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.240
 above are completely curly but straight 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.310
 with long heavy tap hang themselves 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.290
 yes , that's why I have the top of it so 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.130
 wavy and go down then log 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.030
 So some of them attract that too 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 completely so how do you do that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.550
 So I lure myself too small 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.440
 lure but I find just when one 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.360
 has somehow extreme stages 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.490
 Funny, that's why I only do it upstairs 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.230
 such a slight wave motion almost pure 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.910
 that it is not that smooth and that 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.650
 like to lure down there and then 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.320
 only the hair I now front off 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.790
 just my pony so out of the face 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.520
 but that's just a matter of taste 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.320
 likes it so much and then fuck 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.110
 Do it with a bit of hairspray 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.340
 I still have that in the video 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.780
 alverde owns that I have mine 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.490
 bought sometime because I thought 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.080
 it would be vegan but then behind 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.000
 determined that this is not 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.790
 I have now one of barea that is 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.880
 but unfortunately with grad pushes 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.900
 does grass do power that I know 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 Now I can go back that means I can 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.830
 I'll put that into the description 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.450
 if that interests you this is up 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.750
 In any case, but unfortunately as I said 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.490
 with propellant gas would most like a without 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.900
 has sometimes mitchell but that's 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.900
 me now too expensive because of it 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.250
 I prefer to use those from valea now 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.170
 and yes, that's it, too 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.060
 Almost finished a bit 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.080
 rightly shake it with a little fix 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.640
 hair spray 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.800
 I actually only give it up 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.150
 purely where the pony is because I 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.010
 Generally not his products 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.500
 so it may not like it when the sticks so 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.910
 and that's how tight it is 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.040
 I strive for the top only with the Sun 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.910
 annoying because otherwise I would totally ins 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.160
 Face falling 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.480
 and yes I am, too 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.460
 already finished in the back one 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.330
 Fidget if everything is okay 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.330
 bit of hairspray 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.190
 So with me it is relatively fast 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.710
 gone because I said this as I said 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.010
 nature still lure easily and thereby 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.690
 it's really a lot for me 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.730
 simple hairstyle that is relatively fast 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.470
 As you can see in the back you can see 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.850
 actually no transition but you 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.380
 See him now with me easily because he 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.820
 as I said my own upstairs 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.500
 brighter you can see it now but 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.500
 otherwise you would not see that 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.560

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.730
 questions in this regard if answer 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.620
 you still have something on the heart 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.300
