going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.680> ahead<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.100> turn<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:54.729> fancy

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
going to go ahead and turn on fancy

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to go ahead and turn on fancy
graphics<00:01:55.359> real<00:01:55.780> quick<00:01:56.020> just<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.380> you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
graphics real quick just so that you

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.370 
graphics real quick just so that you
guys<00:01:56.680> have<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.549> bit<00:01:57.939> more<00:01:57.969> of<00:01:58.210> an<00:01:58.990> interesting

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
guys have a bit more of an interesting

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800 
guys have a bit more of an interesting
sort<00:01:59.859> of<00:02:00.009> way<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.219> look<00:02:00.490> at<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.000> if<00:02:01.359> you

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
sort of way to look at it and if you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870 
sort of way to look at it and if you
have<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> two<00:02:02.350> waterfalls<00:02:02.770> coming<00:02:03.219> down<00:02:03.399> here

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
have the two waterfalls coming down here

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.999 
have the two waterfalls coming down here
that<00:02:04.060> would<00:02:04.240> look<00:02:04.359> absolutely<00:02:04.840> amazing<00:02:05.469> and

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
that would look absolutely amazing and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.880 
that would look absolutely amazing and
really<00:02:06.189> really<00:02:06.549> cool<00:02:06.789> as<00:02:07.060> well<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.689> I've<00:02:08.649> no

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
really really cool as well and I've no

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.410 
really really cool as well and I've no
clue<00:02:09.009> why<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.220> waterfalls<00:02:09.789> have<00:02:10.030> stopped

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
clue why the waterfalls have stopped

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.930 
clue why the waterfalls have stopped
flowing<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.020> think<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.410> might<00:02:11.620> be<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:12.040> glitch<00:02:12.760> or

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
flowing I think it might be a glitch or

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
flowing I think it might be a glitch or
something<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:13.960> ahead<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.230> place<00:02:14.740> a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
something if I just go ahead and place a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
something if I just go ahead and place a
block<00:02:15.130> like

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
block like

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.160 
block like
no<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> don't<00:02:16.880> want<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> stop<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.390> source<00:02:17.810> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
no I don't want to stop the source but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.270 
no I don't want to stop the source but
there<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.410> go<00:02:18.530> i<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.920> should<00:02:19.070> make<00:02:19.220> it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
there we go i think that should make it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.240 
there we go i think that should make it
continue<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.000> flow<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.620> yeah<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> don't<00:02:21.830> know<00:02:21.980> why

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
continue to flow I yeah I don't know why

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.770 
continue to flow I yeah I don't know why
these<00:02:22.310> blocks<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.910> stopped<00:02:23.240> flowing<00:02:23.420> maybe

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
these blocks have stopped flowing maybe

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.690 
these blocks have stopped flowing maybe
if<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.200> just<00:02:24.350> go<00:02:24.500> ahead<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.920> sort<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.520> go

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
if I can just go ahead and sort of go

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.180 
if I can just go ahead and sort of go
like<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:27.350> there<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.740> go<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.130> can

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
like this there there we go so you can

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.400 
like this there there we go so you can
just<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.300> why<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.600> source<00:02:30.080> blocks

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
just I don't know why the source blocks

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.020 
just I don't know why the source blocks
or<00:02:30.560> whatever<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.920> blocks<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.400> stopped

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
or whatever the blocks have stopped

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.240 
or whatever the blocks have stopped
updating<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.750> if<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.050> just<00:02:33.680> place<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> block

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
updating but if you just place a block

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.190 
updating but if you just place a block
in<00:02:34.610> around<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.090> area<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.600> should<00:02:35.840> cause<00:02:36.050> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
in around that area it should cause a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530 
in around that area it should cause a
block<00:02:36.440> update<00:02:36.950> allowing<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> waterfalls<00:02:38.390> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
block update allowing the waterfalls to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.030 
block update allowing the waterfalls to
continue<00:02:38.900> falling<00:02:39.110> but<00:02:39.320> that's<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.740> cool

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
continue falling but that's really cool

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.850 
continue falling but that's really cool
but<00:02:40.070> there's<00:02:40.490> also<00:02:40.670> one<00:02:41.000> more<00:02:41.060> cool<00:02:41.510> thing

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
but there's also one more cool thing

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.580 
but there's also one more cool thing
this<00:02:42.860> village<00:02:43.280> also<00:02:43.520> has<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.390> blacksmith<00:02:45.110> now

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
this village also has a blacksmith now

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.200 
this village also has a blacksmith now
if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.830> go<00:02:45.980> down<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:46.490> over<00:02:46.520> here<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
if you go down right over here and the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.580 
if you go down right over here and the
blacksmith<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.780> actually<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> first

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
blacksmith is actually one of the first

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.250 
blacksmith is actually one of the first
of<00:02:48.850> two<00:02:49.850> buildings<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.570> can<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:50.990> off<00:02:51.230> of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
of two buildings that you can see off of

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.020 
of two buildings that you can see off of
sponsor<00:02:52.010> when<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.280> go<00:02:52.400> ahead<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.790> spawn

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
sponsor when you go ahead and spawn

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.790 
sponsor when you go ahead and spawn
you're<00:02:53.210> facing<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.660> way<00:02:53.720> there's<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.530> house

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
you're facing this way there's a house

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.020 
you're facing this way there's a house
over<00:02:55.010> here<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:55.730> there's<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
over here and then there's a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.790 
over here and then there's a
blacksmith's<00:02:56.660> workshop<00:02:56.840> which<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.650> go

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
blacksmith's workshop which you can go

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.950 
blacksmith's workshop which you can go
ahead<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> sort<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.850> break<00:02:59.060> into<00:02:59.420> real<00:02:59.630> quick

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
ahead and sort of break into real quick

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.470 
ahead and sort of break into real quick
and<00:03:00.110> we're<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.800> go<00:03:00.860> ahead<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.430> what

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and we're going to go ahead and see what

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.380 
and we're going to go ahead and see what
the<00:03:02.480> blacksmith<00:03:03.080> has<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:04.040> his<00:03:04.280> workshop<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.240> if

we go ahead and light up this area

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.550 
we go ahead and light up this area
because<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.730> shader<00:03:08.510> pack<00:03:08.960> that<00:03:09.140> i'm<00:03:09.260> using

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
because the shader pack that i'm using

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.350 
because the shader pack that i'm using
right<00:03:09.590> now<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:10.070> kind<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.520> dark<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.030> anyway

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360
