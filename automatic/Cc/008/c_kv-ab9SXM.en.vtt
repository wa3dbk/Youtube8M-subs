00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.740
 an ambulance for example that was 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.560
 the laugh well wide open for a front 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.390
 from home running a nurse buy 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.099
 life no no no 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.900
 and that's why I did not know what to do because 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.300
 first I thought it had been something had 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.150
 not passed and that's how it stayed 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.379
 registered the dwarf in the ambulance that 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.379
 they went to 33s 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.170
 and is left behind 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.880
 you lose many materials and leveling 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.600
 well for it to be well stable the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 piece and that is good at the level 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.290
 if not the piece because I want to tilt 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.770
 backwards or to the side as 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.470
 falling after siena and dry 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.150
 that 's the most important thing because 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.650
 a banana 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.650
 there is no one with whom or where we are going 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:12.460
 i 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.460
 the most important thing is the presence 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.479
 natural 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.659
 I do not like 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 until the part with a public 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.560
 and what is the part we draw 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.570
 I dont know 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 106 years of habit 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.310
 hand 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.600
 imagine education 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.020
 two 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.550
 and more than 16 years we condemn all 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.480
 and how the mixture started 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.480
 and it always ends what it was 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.380
 the soul 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.250
 to take molds 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.400
 better all the dwarfs that are here 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.560
 my character but I have a client 50 and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.520
 friends 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.350
 sweet of many years cost me many 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.830
 years to take the purchase of viewings 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.710
 has all my pieces all 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.800
 and also to her she said that's why she was born 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.390
 snow white because he wanted it and that 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.170
 did for it 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.190
 the day I presented you my children are 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.190
 SIGN AND Cough 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:45.330
 here to have this is the first one to fulfill 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.330
 this is called francisco soberón 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.270
 this is called feverish 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.920
 That is the world that I told Carmen 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.920
 He says 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 beautiful 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.780
 and this is called lucerito 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.390
 This I had to buy with the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.390
 wheelbarrows to help me work 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.390
 dresses 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.950
 because if there is no one to help me and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.340
 how did you start with our dictionary 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.750
 I started because it represents reduced 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.849
 white snow at school 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.709
 villagarcía with that 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.090
 and when there is that representation 

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:43.330
 when I was 11 years old and now I have 85 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.880
 and from that moment on you started 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.980
 I fell in love with the dwarfs when 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.650
 I started to see them on the road maldonado 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.729
 in a house that they sold us - I started 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.729
 buy from one 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.720
 and as they brought them to them I bought 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.699
 One came from Pando, went down, no 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.120
 I found one and that came to me 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.120
 bring 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.620
 because it's true that they bring good 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.350
 wave is not only on a good wave and 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.530
 they are a purity and a love and a peace for 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.810
 the house help you in all of them and which 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.620
 I know you have a little more love 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.870
 of love to everyone but this is the one 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.300
 I want majesty of chiquita that in the 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.220
 in front of this you can continue to work 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.220
 sure you help me 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.070
 and what it gives me peace and makes me want to 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.590
 want the acts and that's why the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.910
 kids come to see me 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.390
 Dwarfs that attracts us to the kids 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.780
 because they represent the 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.650
 dwarfs goodness purity tenderness 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.630
 everything children 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.120
 all the beauty that can give us the 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.270
 Uruguay is represented by my dwarfs 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.660
 all the children 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.200
 how strange they have asked me for an unpainted 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.010
 with ladybugs 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.580
 and that's weird they have not had dwarfs 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.710
 blacks 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.860
 what a funny pity but the ladybugs 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.330
 new and after that start to paint 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.330
 with more crazy colors you saw 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:31.270
 but for what 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.270
 a client gave me luck 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.040
 and the merit as a non-sissy look 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.070
 we started with the blue jean pants 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.500
 we started to make a belt 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.290
 I do not know the pockets the closure and 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.380
 we continue with the organizes in the piece 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.030
 it has very limited 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.030
 and we started in the pocket 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.509
 half the field by the put of 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.509
 we painted the pink shoes 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.770
 and we put everything a bit the truth that 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.340
 to be a real sissy and take and 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.340
 take the ball away 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:17.170
 and that it was a very successful gift 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.170
 finish
