00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
disappointing about this toy is the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
disappointing about this toy is the
packaging<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:30.090> lets<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.110> allows

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
packaging really lets it down and allows

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you to steal components very easily what

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.179 
you to steal components very easily what

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I've found is it takes absolutely no

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
I've found is it takes absolutely no
effort<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.700> rip<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> component<00:01:36.270> off<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.630> toy

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and there's no protection in stopping

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.120 
and there's no protection in stopping
someone<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.020> getting<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.829> taking

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
someone from getting in there and taking

this<00:03:34.299> is<00:03:34.510> go<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.019> look<00:03:35.260> at<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.500> Peppa<00:03:35.799> Pig

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129
