00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
industrial equipment look at that

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.370 
industrial equipment look at that
basically<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.640> exact<00:04:58.910> same<00:04:59.150> kind<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.870> plug

that's on the standard Neo Geo CD

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.110 
that's on the standard Neo Geo CD
controller<00:05:03.530> but<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:04.760> just<00:05:05.090> looks<00:05:05.450> cooler

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120

I've said before you have to respect

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.240 
I've said before you have to respect
controllers<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:14.960> are<00:05:15.110> larger<00:05:15.650> than<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
controllers that are larger than the

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.210 
controllers that are larger than the
video<00:05:16.430> game<00:05:16.610> consoles<00:05:17.540> themself<00:05:18.230> and<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:19.070> Neo

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220

Geo<00:05:19.550> CD<00:05:19.850> is<00:05:20.150> not<00:05:20.300> even<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.690> small<00:05:20.930> game<00:05:21.260> console

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
Geo CD is not even a small game console

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.480 
Geo CD is not even a small game console
look<00:05:21.980> at<00:05:22.100> this

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
look at this

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.390 
look at this
it's<00:05:23.030> ridiculous<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.440> check<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.860> out<00:05:25.130> if<00:05:25.280> you

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
it's ridiculous so check it out if you

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.780 
it's ridiculous so check it out if you
like<00:05:25.600> giant<00:05:26.600> real<00:05:26.870> arcade<00:05:27.350> style<00:05:28.070> joysticks

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
like giant real arcade style joysticks

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.810 
like giant real arcade style joysticks
the<00:05:28.940> mas<00:05:29.480> multi<00:05:30.350> arcade<00:05:30.740> system<00:05:31.160> joystick<00:05:31.640> for

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
the mas multi arcade system joystick for

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.150 
the mas multi arcade system joystick for
the<00:05:31.910> Neo<00:05:32.090> Geo<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:32.660> for<00:05:33.320> numerous<00:05:33.710> other<00:05:33.830> game

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:43.830 
the Neo Geo and for numerous other game
consoles<00:05:36.850> which<00:05:38.140> gives<00:05:39.140> me<00:05:39.320> an<00:05:39.410> idea

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.260 

being<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:44.990> this<00:05:45.140> is<00:05:45.350> called<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:46.270> multi

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
being that this is called the multi

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.050 
being that this is called the multi
arcade<00:05:47.810> system<00:05:48.320> joystick<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.190> this<00:05:49.730> is<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
arcade system joystick and this is the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.660 
arcade system joystick and this is the
Vectrex<00:05:50.750> arcade<00:05:51.440> system<00:05:51.950> shouldn't<00:05:52.340> there<00:05:52.640> be

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
Vectrex arcade system shouldn't there be

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.280 
Vectrex arcade system shouldn't there be
an<00:05:53.120> mas<00:05:53.990> joystick<00:05:54.620> for<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.400> Vectrex<00:05:56.140> so<00:05:57.140> that

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
an mas joystick for the Vectrex so that

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.410 
an mas joystick for the Vectrex so that
I<00:05:57.320> can<00:05:57.650> play<00:05:57.830> games<00:05:58.130> like<00:05:58.370> Solar<00:05:58.640> Quest<00:05:59.030> using

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
I can play games like Solar Quest using

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.560 
I can play games like Solar Quest using
this<00:05:59.830> how<00:06:00.830> hard<00:06:01.040> can<00:06:01.190> it<00:06:01.250> be<00:06:01.370> this<00:06:02.060> has<00:06:02.300> four

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
this how hard can it be this has four

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.970 
this how hard can it be this has four
buttons<00:06:02.980> that<00:06:03.980> has<00:06:04.250> four<00:06:04.550> buttons<00:06:05.770> get<00:06:06.770> some

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
buttons that has four buttons get some

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.910 
buttons that has four buttons get some
engineers<00:06:07.430> on<00:06:07.640> that
