and this is actually one of the coolest
parts<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:08.010> building<00:00:08.730> something<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.179> you're

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
parts of building something when you're

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.509 
parts of building something when you're
building<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.690> custom<00:00:10.139> piece<00:00:10.290> like<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.679> and

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
building a custom piece like this and

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.700 
building a custom piece like this and
this<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.849> planning<00:00:12.179> stage<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.719> what's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this is the planning stage and what's

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.350 
this is the planning stage and what's
really<00:00:13.920> cool<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.820> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> can

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
really cool about it is is if you can

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.939 
really cool about it is is if you can
sit<00:00:15.570> back<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.320> imagination<00:00:16.920> you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
sit back if you have an imagination you

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.529 
sit back if you have an imagination you
can<00:00:17.220> sit<00:00:17.400> back<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.789> look<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.000> something<00:00:18.359> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
can sit back and look at something and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.830 
can sit back and look at something and
think<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> want<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.939> then

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
think about what you want to do and then

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.330 
think about what you want to do and then
just<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> start<00:00:22.500> playing<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.160> all

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
just kind of start playing with it all

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.120 
just kind of start playing with it all
the<00:00:23.699> sudden<00:00:24.000> things<00:00:24.090> start<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.420> come<00:00:24.600> together

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
the sudden things start to come together

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
the sudden things start to come together
so<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> sat<00:00:26.369> back<00:00:26.550> stripped<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.119> bike<00:00:27.269> down

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so I sat back stripped this bike down

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.910 
so I sat back stripped this bike down
and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> sat<00:00:27.840> back<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.050> took<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> look<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and I sat back and took a look at it and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
and I sat back and took a look at it and
I<00:00:28.980> thought<00:00:29.570> if<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.720> gonna<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.439> thing

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
I thought if I'm gonna make this thing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.650 
I thought if I'm gonna make this thing
into<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.700> Ryder<00:00:32.910> chopper

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
into a kind of a little Ryder chopper

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.470 
into a kind of a little Ryder chopper
I'm<00:00:34.350> obviously<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> seat<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I'm obviously I don't want the seat to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
I'm obviously I don't want the seat to
be<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.559> gonna<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.860> too

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
be way up here because it's gonna be too

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
be way up here because it's gonna be too
high<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> started<00:00:39.570> looking<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
high so when I started looking at this I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
high so when I started looking at this I
took<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.370> basket<00:00:41.940> thing<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> they

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
took the little basket thing that they

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869 
took the little basket thing that they
had<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> back<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.219> took<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> seat<00:00:44.730> off

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
had off the back and took the seat off

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
had off the back and took the seat off
of<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.149> bike<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> cut<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> seat<00:00:46.050> post<00:00:46.230> off

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of this bike and cut the seat post off

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.900 
of this bike and cut the seat post off
of<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.039> there's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> natural<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.690> dip

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
of it and there's a natural little dip

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.279 
of it and there's a natural little dip
writing<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> bars<00:00:51.149> back<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.690> where<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
writing the bars back there where that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.549 
writing the bars back there where that
seat<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.520> happens<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> fit<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.449> perfectly

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
seat just happens to fit there perfectly

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
seat just happens to fit there perfectly
and<00:00:55.910> then<00:00:58.370> once<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> seat<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.390> there

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and then once I have the seat on there

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.959 
and then once I have the seat on there
and<00:01:00.809> sat<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.980> realize<00:01:02.399> these<00:01:02.579> pedals<00:01:02.910> are

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and sat on it I realize these pedals are

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
and sat on it I realize these pedals are
gonna<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.239> way<00:01:03.359> too<00:01:03.390> close<00:01:03.719> I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gonna be way too close I'm going to be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
gonna be way too close I'm going to be
putting<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.580> front<00:01:05.729> end<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
putting a different front end on this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.710 
putting a different front end on this
anyway<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> figured<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.240> once

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
anyway so what I figured I could do once

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.149 
anyway so what I figured I could do once
I<00:01:09.840> pick<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> front<00:01:10.320> wheel<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
I pick the front wheel off this I

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:21.440 
I pick the front wheel off this I
realized<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.909> height<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> gonna

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
realized that kind of height is gonna

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
realized that kind of height is gonna
make<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
make that thing really cool so what I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.080 
make that thing really cool so what I
can<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.280> pedals<00:01:26.759> off<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can do is I can take these pedals off of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
can do is I can take these pedals off of
here

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
here

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
here
I<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.810> add<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> second<00:01:28.350> sprocket<00:01:28.770> onto<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
I can add a second sprocket onto the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
I can add a second sprocket onto the
other<00:01:29.189> side<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.939> turn<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.329> pedal

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
other side and I could turn this pedal

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.580 
other side and I could turn this pedal
assembly<00:01:31.439> into<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> jack<00:01:32.460> shaft<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.560> run<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
assembly into a jack shaft and run a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
assembly into a jack shaft and run a
second<00:01:34.979> set<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> pedals<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.200> once<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> did

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
legs come up I won't to wear the front

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760 
legs come up I won't to wear the front
forks<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.060> bike<00:01:59.330> so<00:02:00.170> if<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.380> said<00:02:00.620> that

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
forks and on this bike so if I said that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.860 
forks and on this bike so if I said that
bike<00:02:01.010> right<00:02:01.250> there<00:02:01.460> that's<00:02:02.390> about<00:02:02.570> where

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
bike right there that's about where

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.150 
bike right there that's about where
those<00:02:02.960> pedals<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.380> go<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.770> they'll<00:02:03.890> be<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.100> a

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
those pedals can go and they'll be in a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.460 
those pedals can go and they'll be in a
perfect<00:02:04.520> spot<00:02:04.730> so<00:02:05.660> now<00:02:05.780> all<00:02:05.900> I'm<00:02:06.050> gonna<00:02:06.260> have

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
perfect spot so now all I'm gonna have

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.830 
perfect spot so now all I'm gonna have
to<00:02:06.590> do<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:07.520> cut<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:07.970> bike<00:02:08.180> off<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> top

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
to do is cut this bike off on the top

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.930 
to do is cut this bike off on the top
frame<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.440> got<00:02:09.740> this<00:02:09.860> seat<00:02:10.100> post<00:02:10.310> off<00:02:10.520> cut

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
frame here got this seat post off cut

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.360 
frame here got this seat post off cut
the<00:02:11.060> frame<00:02:11.210> off<00:02:11.420> there<00:02:11.660> cut<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.530> off<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:12.950> well

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the frame off there cut it off here well

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.730 
the frame off there cut it off here well
these<00:02:13.550> two<00:02:13.790> together<00:02:14.230> run<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.440> sprocket

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
these two together run this sprocket

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.620 
these two together run this sprocket
back<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.490> one<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.540> gonna

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
back to that one because and it's gonna

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.180 
back to that one because and it's gonna
work<00:02:17.720> out<00:02:17.960> perfectly<00:02:18.380> because<00:02:18.590> these<00:02:18.860> chains

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
work out perfectly because these chains

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.190 
work out perfectly because these chains
are<00:02:19.610> different<00:02:20.000> sizes<00:02:20.180> one's<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.720> 3-speed

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
are different sizes one's a 3-speed

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.260 
are different sizes one's a 3-speed
one's<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.500> single-speed<00:02:21.920> most<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.910> time<00:02:23.090> that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
one's a single-speed most the time that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.190 
one's a single-speed most the time that
means<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.600> chains<00:02:23.810> are<00:02:23.960> going<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.110> be

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
means the chains are going to be

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.630 
means the chains are going to be
different<00:02:24.500> sizes<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.920> know<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.220> all<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.460> time

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
different sizes I know not all the time

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.300 
different sizes I know not all the time
but<00:02:26.030> sometimes<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:27.980> works<00:02:28.160> out

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
but sometimes so this works out

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.680 
but sometimes so this works out
perfectly<00:02:28.670> because<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.209> run<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.360> different

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
perfectly because I can run a different

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
perfectly because I can run a different
size<00:02:29.840> chain<00:02:30.170> around<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.709> second<00:02:31.040> sprocket<00:02:31.550> on

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
size chain around a second sprocket on

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.860 
size chain around a second sprocket on
here<00:02:31.850> welded<00:02:32.209> on<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.390> other<00:02:32.540> side<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
here welded on the other side of the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.510 
here welded on the other side of the
pedals<00:02:33.200> I'd<00:02:33.830> be<00:02:34.010> running<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.490> a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
pedals I'd be running it like a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.190 
pedals I'd be running it like a
jackstaff<00:02:35.000> chopped<00:02:35.480> assembly<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
jackstaff chopped assembly and it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.180 
jackstaff chopped assembly and it
doesn't<00:02:36.500> matter<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.770> they're<00:02:37.070> two

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
doesn't matter that they're two

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.330 
doesn't matter that they're two
different<00:02:37.459> size<00:02:37.610> chains<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.950> like<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.190> said

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
different size chains in so like I said

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.740 
different size chains in so like I said
I'll<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.790> its<00:02:40.910> companies<00:02:41.209> two<00:02:41.360> apart

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
I'll have to do its companies two apart

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.660 
I'll have to do its companies two apart
well<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.530> two<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.770> them<00:02:42.860> together<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
well the two of them together and the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.120 
well the two of them together and the
nice<00:02:43.850> thing<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> rake<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:45.920> if<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
nice thing is for the rake on this if I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.830 
nice thing is for the rake on this if I
want<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.400> change<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.760> rake<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.240> don't<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.750> to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
want to change the rake I don't have to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.340 
want to change the rake I don't have to
do<00:02:47.930> any<00:02:48.110> cutting<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.680> all<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.610> do

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

rate whatever I want to make it Plus
this<00:03:01.070> thing<00:03:01.130> has<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> triple<00:03:01.820> tree<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.090> already

this thing has a triple tree on already

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.660 
this thing has a triple tree on already
so<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.140> can<00:03:03.320> take<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.620> tubes<00:03:04.010> out<00:03:04.130> makes<00:03:04.459> I

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
so I can take these tubes out makes I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.220 
so I can take these tubes out makes I
can<00:03:04.910> extend<00:03:05.180> those<00:03:05.390> tubes<00:03:05.630> or<00:03:05.840> shorten<00:03:06.140> them

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
can extend those tubes or shorten them

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.020 
can extend those tubes or shorten them
to<00:03:06.350> whatever<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.739> want<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.459> make<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.730> front

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
to whatever I want I can make that front

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
that's what I'm saying about the beauty

that's what I'm saying about the beauty
of<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.110> planning<00:03:12.470> stages<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.250> take

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
of the planning stages you can just take

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.310 
of the planning stages you can just take
a<00:03:13.430> look<00:03:13.610> at<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:13.910> stuff<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.330> see<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
a look at this stuff and see what it is

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.840 
a look at this stuff and see what it is
you're<00:03:15.470> gonna<00:03:15.590> make<00:03:15.860> I'm<00:03:16.430> gonna<00:03:16.550> have<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.760> do

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
you're gonna make I'm gonna have to do

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.520 
you're gonna make I'm gonna have to do
very<00:03:17.030> little<00:03:17.150> fabrication<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.050> thing

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
very little fabrication on this thing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.780 
very little fabrication on this thing
as<00:03:18.709> long<00:03:19.040> as<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.310> welds<00:03:19.670> together

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
as long as it all welds together

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.430 
as long as it all welds together
properly<00:03:20.180> when<00:03:20.870> they<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.110> pretty<00:03:21.350> cool
