00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.569
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.569
 tv powered by baden tv 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.730
 we know that to do something well 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.890
 We have this game in for us 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.240
 checked off 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.099
 we know that or have disappointed 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.240
 and of course that was just our fans 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.689
 disappointed and that was natural 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.880
 here at home against darmstadt ago 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.860
 make up for a sold-out house 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.079
 it will be necessary too 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.980
 just defend the good compact 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.989
 to have structure 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.969
 that was against but not the case 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.960
 that you are not so good 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.740
 has acted must not happen but 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 we will 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.800
 we will really have the compact has us 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.420
 Excellent has a day to lay 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770
 You can see that even if you with the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.270
 darmstadt compares the two 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.020
 Teams did not make much difference 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.450
 have completely the same identical 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.160
 gate ratio darmstadt this 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.290
 Team over their structure theirs 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.560
 compactness comes very strong 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.320
 and warmer years of course 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.939
 have to go to the home shows here 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.520
 when I think of st pauli or even 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.500
 the second from now on that was that 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.590
 he play well but also accordingly 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.440
 compact aggressive and defend advice 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.659
 and then we think I'm a tough one 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.780
 contested nice endgame on 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.880
 Monday evening before 30,000 130 thousand 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 People that everyone can look forward to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.540
 We do that too 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.170
 we have that for us as I said 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.910
 have ticked off the feeling that you have something 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.030
 has lost that remains maybe 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.350
 for a two days but otherwise must 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.000
 you look at the table and say 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.670
 We see three days to go before the end 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.460
 fourth we have the possibility in the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.270
 good result 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.070
 and that is something for the present time 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.680
 that would be absolutely positive for me 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.880
 before the season one said you are up 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520
 at the conclusion about fight for the fight with 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.900
 then everyone would have cheered 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.760
 At the moment this feels like many 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.980
 to the other way and for us also the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.360
 first two three days but now it applies 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.690
 to look forward 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.620
 to see the possibilities to gas 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.910
 and put everything into it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.910
 that would do on monday 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 yes in any case that 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 We do not want to talk around 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.350
 pressure or channel somehow 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 it is very clear now it starts 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.530
 canned 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.110
 and now synonymous and team as 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.940
 team to be there and last but not least 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.620
 this impression of the then prevails 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.360
 is normal but otherwise have synonymous 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 also give easy to hold and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.280
 to show that it works 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.340
 are more likely to ding her Liche change 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.900
 depending on the opponent once ignored 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.360
 whether at home or abroad always 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.570
 again a line have us in the backlash 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.650
 already made and a bit higher 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.020
 I think they will do it again 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.230
 do not expect any enemy of himself 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.910
 Put in the back and lurking in the counter 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.430
 because for this opponent the very compact 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.320
 defends yes but expect no opponent 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.350
 who leaves us the field now or 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.300
 not expect opponents of the same as 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.280
 we want that the opponent attacks the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.580
 to face opponents and tries the ball 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.580
 to fight for 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.990
 of course, very nice it has 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.000
 also clear 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.470
 every other week no question at all 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.820
 only we do not complain about 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.560
 Absent spectators we have the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.210
 chance to show each week that it is 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.100
 It is worth to watch our players 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.770
 for that we do everything as we strive 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.210
 a lot and maybe some have that 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.370
 Do not fry yet 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.240
 no idea but we want the fans 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.460
 conquer 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.750
 that are welcome to come to us 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.070
