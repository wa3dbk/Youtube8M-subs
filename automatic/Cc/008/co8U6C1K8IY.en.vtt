on the front from flying cables and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
on the front from flying cables and
we'll<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> progress<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.810> vehicle

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
we'll see the progress of the vehicle

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
we'll see the progress of the vehicle
that<00:01:19.229> we're<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> turn<00:01:20.159> over<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.240> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that we're going to turn over this is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.859 
that we're going to turn over this is
basically<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> pipe<00:01:22.680> ramp<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.869> nearside

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
basically the pipe ramp the nearside

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.840 
basically the pipe ramp the nearside
wishbone<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.740> car<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.460> contact<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
wishbone of the car will contact you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
wishbone of the car will contact you
about<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> foot<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> ramp<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.280> 30<00:01:32.280> 40<00:01:32.700> mile

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
about a foot up the ramp at 30 40 mile

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.780 
about a foot up the ramp at 30 40 mile
an<00:01:32.880> hour<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> car<00:01:34.470> approaches<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.549> ramp

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
an hour as the car approaches the ramp

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.230 
an hour as the car approaches the ramp
this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> winch<00:01:37.470> cable

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
this is the time that the winch cable

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.620 
this is the time that the winch cable
should<00:01:39.240> disengage<00:01:40.790> from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> vehicle<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
should disengage from the vehicle and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
should disengage from the vehicle and
obviously<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.860> continues<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> ramp<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
obviously as it continues up the ramp it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.530 
obviously as it continues up the ramp it
will<00:01:45.390> twist<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.439> car<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.689> hopefully<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> will

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
will twist the car and hopefully it will

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.600 
will twist the car and hopefully it will
show<00:01:50.110> us<00:01:50.260> what<00:01:50.440> happens<00:01:50.740> when<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.010> car<00:01:51.190> lands

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
show us what happens when the car lands

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.420 
show us what happens when the car lands
upside<00:01:51.760> down<00:01:52.150> this<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.470> means<00:01:54.130> of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
upside down this is the means of

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.750 
upside down this is the means of
steering<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.000> car<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:56.010> dragging<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.130> towards

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
steering the car and dragging it towards

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.600 
steering the car and dragging it towards
