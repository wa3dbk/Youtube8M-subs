 [Music] 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 we found a three against three we are 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.410
 lose to catch this tank better than 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 is a little more hiding places when 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 we are when three against three and all 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.430
 the world we carry rocket launcher tank and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 we are all here in plan on one side to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 face boy so you have to start 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 shoot and there is the we put a good 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 smack well to me nothing comes to me 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.829
 burst basic burst is not a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 Last one that buys a dead party is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.320
 a bush kills all the time and to see 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.489
 because here do not play with strategies 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 care, it's worth, we'll sell it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.290
 let's solve what we're selling 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.290
 kid tools 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 are that I do not expect us to continue giving 20 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.750
 here is our partner who is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.620
 covering with a bazooka 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.620
 and the eyes 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.810
 that is coming for me and this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.760
 honestly very much then first as 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.930
 this one that had a lot of tank and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.850
 later when the tanks run out 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.760
 I guess you have to catch that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.260
 will have to kill with the rocket launchers 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 I think 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.320
 Hello 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 therefore I go to another tank 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 51 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.910
 addis so that the kid opens and not the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.500
 park list was around here uncle 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.170
 I would try I do not know where it is 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.900
 so I need another tank and I need 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.570
 a tank but already we're going 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.600
 come on let's go behind we go 73 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.680
 winning 83 we ride to see if now 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 let me ride please 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 they are destroyed a little bit this is worth 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.850
 we've caught us I follow him 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.850
 shot just in case 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.570
 so when it starts to whistle the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.840
 tank was a bad roll okay I think that 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.640
 I'm going to play on search engines I think 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.380
 it leaves more profitable quality and as they remain 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 seeker then of ambush I mean 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.990
 go through here on the street concellos and go 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 putting lp pinnacle to the rock there is a 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.420
 type also 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.420
 there is a time now with the rocket launcher 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 static because it goes without a tank 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:53.480
 here the unfortunate I will look 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.480
 who but but how not 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.840
 and also 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:07.200
 pineapple and guys 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.430
 come on let's go here back 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 the uncle is watching for me 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.349
 doing searching he knows much more profitable 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.280
 ok I think you already have me on the map 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.290
 I think right now it's something in the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.159
 minimal abandonment yes sure 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.159
 try to get in here as very well 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.560
 it was very very peeking 215 2 15 11 eye it 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 puts the thing stayed minute 25 seconds 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.080
 no one will try to keep walking 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.790
 I see that it is more profitable boy but 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.880
 walking in plan well enter here 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 in ambush 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 by buildings jumping can also 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.740
 be pretty good there is 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 because up here it's complicated from the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.100
 more guys 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.060
 I'm seeing an uncle something 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.600
 I think there's a man out there 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:20.989
 I saw everything and speaking clearly 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.820
 we have a plan to end with the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.780
 40 seconds left I think it comes out 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.639
 much more profitable a tank of more 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.600
 careful that we go back to 1915 careful 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.600
 care care care huh 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.000
 it is possible to make a kind of 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.830
 pass 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.390
 they're all over there and start 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.390
 shoot like crazy well we're not going 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.630
 they're around here they're here 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.630
 look at the miserable lad 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:01.550
 when we are going down quickly 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.830
 and if not, it will not continue on the other side 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.350
 13 14 more has arrived with seconds remaining 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.780
 these our to carry is to take our 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.670
