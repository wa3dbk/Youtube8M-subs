00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello my friend, bettor is very well 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 Welcome to this video here the bettor 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.019
 gustavo member of course after smart 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.849
 I am the same person who sent emails 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.820
 in the last days 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 where he gives tips on the selection of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.150
 numbers 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.060
 the vast majority of players 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 lottery selection on numbers that are already going 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.460
 play in a disfigured way and many 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 without any criteria 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 sometimes picking up lucky numbers 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 commemorative dates passwords and so on 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 What they do not know is that many times 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 playing this way are already intended 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.230
 to be lost even before a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 lottery 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.660
 see a simple example a search that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 she would not have state united states 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 more than 10,000 cards are staked 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.329
 consecutive numbers for example 123456 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.400
 there goes 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 if we analyze the history of the lottery 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.430
 we want to see that there has never been a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 prize of consecutive numbers and even 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 if these figures were to be 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.140
 raffled how much it would give a million divided 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.320
 in 10 thousand winners in Brazil is not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.720
 very different 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 in this video you will start learning 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.479
 how to assemble a game strategically 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 prepared to start learning about how to 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.310
 choose the numbers to play 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 using techniques 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.590
 how to build a well-balanced game 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 using trends in a lottery 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.350
 each time called a notary the number 28 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:55.649
 had a record of 28 draws left with 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 May for 15 times in escaping with more than 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.810
 three times in which the games but not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.079
 I hope this will happen with 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.310
 frequency this was an ultimatum an echo 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.009
 of hot number 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.410
 in these games to date that this video 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.700
 is being recorded and are one of the three 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:23.220
 hottest and coldest mega sena 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.890
 the hottest to 105 in 171 times in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:34.130
 58 155 times the number 33 155 times 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.130
 now the colder numbers the number 26 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.920
 122 a 117 times number 48 122 lives 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.630
 after betting against the trends nor 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.430
 It is always recommended 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.290
 you will have no advantage can 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.920
 choose a book that has already been drawn 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.530
 many lives but that has not left for a long time 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.519
 the raffle 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.359
 then it is better to choose a number that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.139
 has been coming out constantly in the raffles 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.880
 see this very simple example if you 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.260
 throw a coin up 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.799
 there are only two possibilities face or crown 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.760
 and the chance of another occurring is 50 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.489
 50 percent 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.489
 a simple example has only two 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.010
 possibilities however if you play coin 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.370
 up a thousand times the odds of you 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.859
 have 500 faces and 500 crowns are almost 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.269
 zero 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:38.489
 so let's go the advantage tool 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.500
 draw drawings past to assemble 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.439
 A last great draw wrote a 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.510
 one the numbers that lotteries in the mega case 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.069
 sena from 65 down on the left side 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.609
 of the sheet 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.730
 mack x for each of the miners who 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:01.829
 are drawn raise a number from the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.629
 raffle contest on the sheet for the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.909
 construction of the graphics is best 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.389
 consult the buy a notebook 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.819
 checkered but to make life easier 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.280
 in the course after waiting we have models 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.239
 ready by simply branding with an x 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.370
 students who are leaving then my friend 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.580
