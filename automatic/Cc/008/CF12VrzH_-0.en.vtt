00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 choosy and welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.819
 back to another episode of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.540
 idea factory today an ideal match of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.849
 our good something and indeed the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.890
 So possibility layout but look 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.590
 base designs as well as what do you know 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.080
 to report my 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.580
 because there are some and so bumps 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 the picture I took here that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 it was 1 of the harmless ones I wanted 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.699
 to take that extra awful because 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 I think that has synonymous in the video 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.489
 Next I look imagine all 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.399
 what i mean 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.570
 so what to report for example yes 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.610
 so far I do not know what you could do 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 also reported that was me too 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 I know so has base it is true 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.640
 funny but has something as a base of mine 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.649
 Opinion definitely possible 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 search 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 and yes it is called so if he the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.760
 Visited someone or so you have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 Most returned home and what you have 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.270
 still back home 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.070
 the beans on the right and a wall 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 visit less no buttons or 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 Sunday has the debate press report 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 and then the design is reported and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.540
 superstar then has to check it out and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.220
 first money has as I said many design 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.689
 but so really inappropriate 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.369
 And you have no effectiveness 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.990
 so if people think so 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.700
 they have to come most of the time 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.689
 unpunished of what is currently what I am 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.770
 maybe you can give the extra 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.840
 to be developed is cumbersome 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 takes longer and everything and that is whole 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.270
 cool if such a reporting function 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.750
 would be where you know this or because 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.680
 not i have else i believe 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 gigantic pedes or should I too 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 times space layout had seen and yes 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.049
 By the way, I mean something like that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 collectors or and me but also like 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.060
 attacking something does not have to be real 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.090
 I still play many small children 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.189
 and yes i dont know i find it now 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 not so super honestly no 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.180
 just have to decide for yourself 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.320
 so at least not reported finished 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.799
 bad what is there really partial 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.520
 the designs because you think you old something 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.830
 was wrong in the nazi but 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.720
 your opinion gladly to the idea if you 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 have ever designed any 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.260
 have you seen or wanted to report 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 he and all found for the game then 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.370
 like your opinion in the comments 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.430
 at least that had been the case with the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.590
 idea to report the layout 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.270
 and yes, to see a lot and then see 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.270
 us in a row again charlotte
