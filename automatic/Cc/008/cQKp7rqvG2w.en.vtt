00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 This is what one of the most advanced looks like. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.810
 in the world of electric cars 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.520
 this model is tesla brand worth 100,000 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.080
 dollars it is equipped with modern 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300
 equipment providing 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 safety and autopilot mode 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.109
 the manufacturer claims that this is the most 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.599
 electronic car in the world however 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.009
 perhaps this is his weak point two 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.320
 cyber security specialist 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.030
 managed to penetrate the computer system 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.430
 cars get control of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.440
 some of its features on this video 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.600
 the car stops at the touch of a button 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.420
 one of the experts told rt 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.670
 about defects found, we found out that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.100
 Tesla is rather an information center on 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.420
 the wheels than the car we found it seems 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 6 vulnerabilities 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.070
 which told the manufacturer 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.290
 thanks to this information we have revealed 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.210
 imperfection of the car it can 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.490
 start and stop at a distance 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 open the locks horn open 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.550
 the trunk 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.740
 blink headlights this computer which 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.689
 reaches speeds of up to 160 kilometers 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.580
 hour and if the system turns off 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.960
 safety or the driver will not be able to 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.700
 control the speed of movement because 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.530
 that someone changes her being on 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.659
 distance consequences scary myself 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.549
 present to tesla motors stated that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.590
 In the near future will release an addition to 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.630
 car software that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969
 close cooperation with specialists in 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 this area has already established Mark Rogers 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:36.069
 believes that the company is a pair of new 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.319
 look at hackers hope our hacking and 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.270
 all that we managed to do a whole 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.579
 will make it clear to the manufacturer that with 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.829
 hackers can be helpful to collaborate 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.569
 hackers can do you a big favor 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.670
 having worked on your system 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.490
 security and it concerns not only 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.920
 cars absolutely any sphere take 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.679
 example of a building security system or 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 airplanes ultimately 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.700
 cybersecurity is important in everything
