you can get from thousand milkings
auxiliary<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.599> soundlessly<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.409> bose

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
auxiliary in the soundlessly the bose

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.339 
auxiliary in the soundlessly the bose
you've<00:03:27.430> got<00:03:27.519> an<00:03:27.579> s-video<00:03:27.930> composite<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.169> well

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
you've got an s-video composite as well

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.339 
you've got an s-video composite as well
so<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.189> can<00:03:30.310> output<00:03:30.759> video<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.569> your<00:03:31.659> TVs<00:03:32.109> or

whatever color and think DVD player you
want<00:03:35.859> obviously<00:03:36.729> the<00:03:36.849> s-video<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.479> be<00:03:37.599> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
want obviously the s-video would be a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.899 
want obviously the s-video would be a
better<00:03:38.560> quality<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.989> auxiliary<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.849> a

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
better quality the auxiliary that is a

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.580 
better quality the auxiliary that is a
three<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.329> half<00:03:43.479> mil<00:03:43.780> Jake<00:03:44.109> but<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.470> also

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
three and a half mil Jake but it also

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.039 
three and a half mil Jake but it also
supports<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:46.109> Toslink<00:03:47.189> optical<00:03:48.599> as<00:03:49.599> well<00:03:49.780> so

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
supports the Toslink optical as well so

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.439 
supports the Toslink optical as well so
you<00:03:50.109> can<00:03:50.259> keep<00:03:50.439> pure<00:03:50.859> digital<00:03:51.129> signal<00:03:51.759> from

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
you can keep pure digital signal from

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.749 
you can keep pure digital signal from
this<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:54.040> wherever<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.400> wanna<00:03:54.579> go

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.270 
and live video I think um same kind of
thing

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
thing

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.089
