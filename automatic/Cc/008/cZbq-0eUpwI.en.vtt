it's a very very good question and it's
one<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.570> biggest<00:00:12.780> problems<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.500> most

people have in their golf swing so when

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
people have in their golf swing so when
I<00:00:17.369> setup<00:00:17.850> part<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.869> being<00:00:19.109> able<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.439> keep<00:00:19.650> them

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
I setup part of being able to keep them

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
I setup part of being able to keep them
flexed<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.369> when<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:20.820> my<00:00:21.000> rear<00:00:21.270> end<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
flexed is when I get my rear end out I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.890 
flexed is when I get my rear end out I
bend<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> hips<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.640> I'm<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:24.269> body<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
bend at the hips is that I'm my body is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560 
bend at the hips is that I'm my body is
forward<00:00:25.500> enough<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.730> weight<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> the

do<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.230> flexed<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
do they start out pretty flexed if you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
do they start out pretty flexed if you
get<00:00:41.579> too<00:00:41.820> flexed<00:00:42.390> naturally<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.320> brain

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
get too flexed naturally your brain

unflexible in most people will have a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
unflexible in most people will have a
tendency<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.710> straighten<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.370> go

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
tendency to straighten that as they go

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.360 
tendency to straighten that as they go
back<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:51.960> want<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> occur<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.100> want

feet kind of on the balls when I turn I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.830 
feet kind of on the balls when I turn I
got<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> feel<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.859> almost<00:01:02.399> sitting<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
slightly it's not actually increasing it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750

there and I'm really into a - a mode
that<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.970> spring<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.590> explode<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that I can spring and explode out of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.840 
that I can spring and explode out of
when<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:22.799> changed<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.549> height

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
when I go here I've changed my height

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.990 
when I go here I've changed my height
now<00:01:24.720> I've<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> try<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> find<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:26.189> most

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
now I've got to try to find it back most

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
now I've got to try to find it back most
people<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:28.080> way<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> key<00:01:29.369> is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
people go the other way so the key is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
people go the other way so the key is
where's<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.450> weight<00:01:30.689> across<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> balls<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.799> my

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
where's my weight across the balls of my

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
where's my weight across the balls of my
feet<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.420> where's<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.689> weight<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.200> my

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
feet and where's my weight that my

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.190 
feet and where's my weight that my
weights<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.189> side<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.810> hold

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
weights on my right side now just hold

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.249 
weights on my right side now just hold
that<00:01:37.380> position<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.369> turn<00:01:38.930> another<00:01:39.930> thing

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that position and turn another thing

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
that position and turn another thing
that<00:01:40.409> causes<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> when

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that causes that a lot is that when

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
that causes that a lot is that when
people<00:01:41.850> turn<00:01:42.420> their<00:01:42.450> hips<00:01:42.840> too<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.590> start

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
people turn their hips too much to start

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.319 
people turn their hips too much to start
with<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.250> tend<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> straighten<00:01:45.000> their<00:01:45.149> leg

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
with they tend to straighten their leg

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
with they tend to straighten their leg
so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> don't<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> turn<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.799> hips<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> want

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so I don't want to turn my hips I want

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.410 
so I don't want to turn my hips I want
