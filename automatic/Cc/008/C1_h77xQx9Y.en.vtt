00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone the other day I will do 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.230
 This guidance was necessary as one of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.139
 terms of participation in the total competition 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190
 evolution who is not aware go and impedance 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 it's humility 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 composition of your body by using 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.439
 electrical impulse that is through 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.250
 your body is missing weak 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.050
 electric current and apparatus by 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.349
 simple calculations determines 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.199
 resistance of your body as well as 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.469
 resistance from all body tissues 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.570
 different and it is known 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.920
 your body composition the error of this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 method as it is considered no more than two 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 percent but you also need to consider that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.890
 liquid or liquid or food inside 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.260
 organism also play the role of error 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.969
 definition of body composition means 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 how many muscles and how much and how much 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.070
 fluid in the body but of course there is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 inaccuracies such as if the impulse goes not 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.489
 through the whole body that is if you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 want an exact result for the whole body 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 then access points should be in different 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.950
 his ends like arms and legs 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.770
 There are other ways to measure the composition 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.640
 his body and each of them has its 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.150
 cons and pros 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.680
 if you measure one day use 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.100
 in one day at once several ways 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.330
 then in practice the difference in results 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.760
 can reach 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.369
 between five and ten percent therefore 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.350
 here you need to choose yourself 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:38.650
 what method is available to you and evaluate it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.979
 by practice over time 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.110
 since it is accurate as it is considered the most 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.860
 accurate method of measuring body composition 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.149
 it is an x-ray scanner but its very 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.789
 need to search because it is far from 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.210
 every clinic has such an apparatus and yes 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.130
 the procedure will be quite expensive 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.640
 The data I receive is the most for me 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.050
 interesting is how much fat do i have 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.050
 it turned out I own mode 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:31.799
 directors 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:35.170
 but fat for men on average is 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.390
 18-24 percent plus or minus small 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.519
 adjusting for age for 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.859
 women are around 25-30 percent fat 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.859
 good physical shape is about 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 for men and he's over 17 percent fat for 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:57.400
 girls 2025 excess fat 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:01.239
 more than 20 are considered obese. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.970
 percent of fat in men in women then 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.180
 somewhere over 30 percent for each 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.859
 sport has its own recommendations 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.109
 at optimal amount of fat for 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.209
 performances in swimming competitions 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.579
 for example, it is about 6 and 10 percent 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.639
 whichever start or sprinter 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.889
 running about the same recommendations for 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:28.959
 about 5 percent more women than 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:31.540
 have up to 15 bodybuilding guys aspire 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.569
 go on stage with the lowest possible 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.989
 for a person, the amount of fat is five 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.650
 three five percent 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.349
 mans physicist somewhere 8-10 percent fat 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.540
 girls bikini as I understand 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.500
 probably the best percent 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:55.180
 12-15 16 that is to me when mine 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 today's goals need to lose weight and 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.120
 remove about five kilograms of fat 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.120
 fat 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.840
 unless of course the measurements were accurate and the device 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.840
 did not deceive 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.299
 as many have noticed I am in my own 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.150
 training building your workouts 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.579
 using information presented to the world 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.329
 professor of strength i'm new him 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.840
 associates but in any case i consider 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.110
 that in order to adapt some theory 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.520
 for yourself or anyone 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:37.289
 you need to connect your head in your experience 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:40.100
 your feelings are the same in all 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:43.680
 existing training theories have 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.440
 unfinished moment and therefore think 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.740
 progress in science in this direction then 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.060
 there is still a huge plus to 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.060
 lead this practice 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.070
 extra decades therefore think 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.930
 what we will be for a long time 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.320
 witness exciting moments when 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.639
 will water the incomprehensible how 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.840
 it seems records in theory selujanov 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.000
 for example, I have not yet found an answer to 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.770
 question about the mechanisms 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.410
 activating the place of the telet that is in 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.360
 cell satellites and at the moment 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.760
 there is already a study which 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.180
 shows that when training 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.760
 the number of cores increases and 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.970
 the number of muscle cells themselves 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.889
 link you can see here if 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.830
 someone has already figured out this issue and 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:46.110
 found the answers write in the comments will 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.750
 thank you and Viktor Nikolaevich himself 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.030
 mentions that directly in the muscular 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.820
 cell during its operation no one yet 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.030
 I looked more and more available communication 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.090
 with lack of technology development 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:04.740
 that is, we cannot yet see for sure 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.070
 exactly how protein synthesis occurs and 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.570
 how does it activate this 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.020
 muscular issues 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.020
 activities 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:18.120
 the more a person understands 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.840
 the better he understands how much 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.790
 things still to be known before 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.630
 unequivocally argue that this or that 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:30.150
 action in training effects on 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.860
 some factor so i would 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.740
 recommended an integrated approach to 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.990
 study muscle development who is 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.090
 really interesting and not 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.130
 dwell on one version 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.620
 The information presented is 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.940
 consider all the theories to choose 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.150
 the most adequate objective and 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.350
 logical 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:57.500
 and of course you need to look wider at studying 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:00.199
 questions that is rummage in anatomy 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.910
 biochemistry at least in those sections 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.910
 that relate to human physiology 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.310
 now I train three times a week 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.410
 I live in a living room Elena for one hour two 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.110
 times a week swim in the pool for minutes 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.620
 25 30 more about the content of these 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.490
 workouts I will tell later 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.720
 video now thank you all good 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.620
 good fortune 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.620
 perfections of oneself
