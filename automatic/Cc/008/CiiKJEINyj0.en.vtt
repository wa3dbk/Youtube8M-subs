00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you go so I think I did a pretty good

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920

job<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.310> first<00:02:05.579> xbox<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.390> course<00:02:06.719> my

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
job on this my first xbox of course my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
job on this my first xbox of course my
second<00:02:07.320> time<00:02:07.439> will<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.829> better<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
second time will be better and I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270 
second time will be better and I
actually<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.080> turned<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.379> really<00:02:10.440> nice

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
actually think it turned out really nice

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually think it turned out really nice
it<00:02:11.430> turned<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> way<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> wanted<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it turned out the way I wanted it to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.900 
it turned out the way I wanted it to
turn<00:02:13.020> out<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.709> only<00:02:13.950> things<00:02:14.190> i<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.520> about<00:02:14.760> it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
turn out the only things i have about it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.670 
turn out the only things i have about it
is<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.060> they're<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> xbox

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
is that they're with the xbox

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.790 
is that they're with the xbox
controllers<00:02:17.220> there's<00:02:17.580> more<00:02:17.880> bumps<00:02:18.800> areas

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
controllers there's more bumps areas

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.920 
controllers there's more bumps areas
where<00:02:20.069> there's<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:21.030> right<00:02:21.300> here<00:02:21.660> between

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
where there's like right here between

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.280 
where there's like right here between
here<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.640> tight<00:02:24.569> space<00:02:24.990> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
here and here is a very tight space and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.140 
here and here is a very tight space and
you<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.620> get<00:02:25.770> some<00:02:26.069> overspray<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.880> there

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
you can get some overspray on there

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.640 
you can get some overspray on there
because<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.600> tape<00:02:27.840> doesn't<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.290> stick

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because the tape doesn't really stick

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.520 
because the tape doesn't really stick
that<00:02:28.860> well<00:02:29.360> other<00:02:30.360> than<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.200> looks

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
that well other than that it looks

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.940 
that well other than that it looks
really<00:02:32.040> nice<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.520> with<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> checkered

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
really nice and with the checkered

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.220 
really nice and with the checkered
design<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> say<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.630> kind<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.020> hard

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
design I have to say it's kind of hard

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.380 
design I have to say it's kind of hard
to<00:02:37.290> follow<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> checkered

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
