basically<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.580> hard<00:01:25.060> part<00:01:25.270> about<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:25.600> place

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
basically a hard part about this place

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.480 
basically a hard part about this place
is<00:01:26.050> that<00:01:26.080> you<00:01:26.560> get<00:01:26.679> on<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.890> water<00:01:27.069> but<00:01:27.310> there's

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
is that you get on the water but there's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.859 
is that you get on the water but there's
no<00:01:27.610> current<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.119> keep<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.390> there<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.750> get

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
no current to keep you there to get

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.230 
no current to keep you there to get
there<00:01:29.050> like<00:01:29.170> really<00:01:29.380> muscle<00:01:29.950> down<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:30.610> so

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
there like really muscle down and now so

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.460 
there like really muscle down and now so
that's<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.479> hard<00:01:31.660> part<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.959> using<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.319> lot<00:01:32.440> of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
that's the hard part is using a lot of

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.749 
that's the hard part is using a lot of
energy<00:01:32.649> while<00:01:32.979> holding<00:01:33.160> your<00:01:33.250> breath<00:01:33.429> but<00:01:33.729> I

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
energy while holding your breath but I

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.339 
energy while holding your breath but I
thought<00:01:34.330> great<00:01:34.390> i'll<00:01:34.720> know<00:01:34.840> how<00:01:34.959> long<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.259> was

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:35.349 
thought great i'll know how long it was

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.710 
thought great i'll know how long it was
but<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.619> was<00:01:35.740> pretty<00:01:35.830> fired<00:01:36.099> up<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.599> ran<00:01:37.599> out<00:01:37.690> of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
but I was pretty fired up and ran out of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.120 
but I was pretty fired up and ran out of
breath<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:37.959> little<00:01:38.080> bit<00:01:38.380> from<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.649> entire

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
breath a little bit from the entire

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.889 
breath a little bit from the entire
routine<00:01:39.520> but<00:01:39.670> he's<00:01:39.789> still<00:01:39.970> probably<00:01:40.209> good<00:01:40.539> we

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
routine but he's still probably good we
