00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
vis post poly yarn for an under wing and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
vis post poly yarn for an under wing and
so<00:00:49.329> let's<00:00:49.510> get<00:00:49.630> started<00:00:50.020> here

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670 

so<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.309> hook<00:01:00.430> we're<00:01:00.610> gonna<00:01:00.700> use<00:01:00.940> today<00:01:01.120> is<00:01:01.480> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
so the hook we're gonna use today is a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.379 
so the hook we're gonna use today is a
die<00:01:02.680> rekey<00:01:03.809> number<00:01:04.809> 10<00:01:07.859> model<00:01:08.859> 700<00:01:09.549> secure

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:10.389 
die rekey number 10 model 700 secure

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:21.139 
die rekey number 10 model 700 secure
here<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:10.749> the<00:01:10.840> vise<00:01:11.049> a<00:01:16.799> layer<00:01:17.799> of<00:01:18.039> thread<00:01:18.340> here

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.639 

actually<00:01:22.149> I'm<00:01:22.270> using<00:01:22.509> mono<00:01:22.899> as<00:01:23.200> stated

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
actually I'm using mono as stated

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:33.709 
actually I'm using mono as stated
earlier<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.729> good<00:01:27.969> base<00:01:28.179> layer<00:01:28.479> on<00:01:28.810> there

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.179 

we're<00:01:34.719> gonna<00:01:34.779> tie<00:01:35.049> in<00:01:35.200> an<00:01:35.289> egg<00:01:35.409> sack<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.799> lot<00:01:36.039> of

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
we're gonna tie in an egg sack a lot of

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.760 
we're gonna tie in an egg sack a lot of
the<00:01:36.279> squalus<00:01:36.959> special<00:01:37.959> obviously<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.409> female

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the squalus special obviously the female

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.339 
the squalus special obviously the female
will<00:01:38.950> have<00:01:39.069> an<00:01:39.219> egg<00:01:39.369> sack<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.599> we're<00:01:41.229> in<00:01:41.289> a

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
will have an egg sack and so we're in a

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.209 
will have an egg sack and so we're in a
tight<00:01:41.590> kind<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.749> say<00:01:43.749> one-third<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.770> way<00:01:45.009> up

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
tight kind of say one-third the way up

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.909 
tight kind of say one-third the way up
the<00:01:45.429> shank<00:01:48.779> so<00:01:49.779> that<00:01:49.929> our<00:01:50.020> body<00:01:50.259> isn't<00:01:50.499> too

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:50.919 
the shank so that our body isn't too

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.849 
the shank so that our body isn't too
long<00:01:51.159> yet<00:01:51.849> we<00:01:51.999> have<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.179> prominent<00:01:52.869> egg<00:01:53.499> sack

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
long yet we have a prominent egg sack

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.440 
long yet we have a prominent egg sack
coming<00:01:54.340> off<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.609> back<00:01:54.819> which<00:01:55.090> adds<00:01:55.299> some

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
coming off the back which adds some

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.739 
coming off the back which adds some
buoyancy<00:01:55.929> as<00:01:56.349> well<00:01:56.560> as<00:01:56.789> realistic<00:01:57.789> back<00:01:58.479> there

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
buoyancy as well as realistic back there

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.479 
buoyancy as well as realistic back there
there<00:02:00.149> we're<00:02:01.149> gonna<00:02:01.299> dub<00:02:01.569> in<00:02:01.810> some<00:02:02.169> olive<00:02:02.950> done

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
there we're gonna dub in some olive done

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:09.089 
there we're gonna dub in some olive done
seal<00:02:03.969> fur<00:02:04.239> here<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.679> said<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.890> good

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
seal fur here like I said a good

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.490 
seal fur here like I said a good
substitute<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:09.910> would<00:02:10.270> be<00:02:10.450> angora<00:02:11.110> or

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
substitute for that would be angora or

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
substitute for that would be angora or
you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.710> even<00:02:11.860> use<00:02:12.070> synthetics

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.420 

let's<00:02:16.000> slice<00:02:16.569> them<00:02:16.780> dubbing<00:02:17.170> here<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.770> on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
let's slice them dubbing here on the on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.199 
let's slice them dubbing here on the on
the<00:02:18.760> mano<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:23.670> don't<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:25.030> go<00:02:25.150> too

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
the mano here I don't like to go too

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.869 
the mano here I don't like to go too
heavy<00:02:25.599> on<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.980> want<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> pretty<00:02:27.400> pretty

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
heavy on that they want a pretty pretty

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.180 
heavy on that they want a pretty pretty
skinny<00:02:28.209> profile<00:02:28.750> body<00:02:31.769> one<00:02:32.769> thing<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:32.980> like

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
skinny profile body one thing I like

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.809 
skinny profile body one thing I like
about<00:02:33.220> using<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> mono<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:39.280> when<00:02:39.700> you

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
about using the mono is that when you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.850 
about using the mono is that when you
are<00:02:39.940> finished<00:02:40.360> applying<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:43.269> dubbing

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
are finished applying the the dubbing

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.229 
are finished applying the the dubbing
instead<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.980> actually<00:02:45.250> using<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.670> ribbing<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
instead of actually using a ribbing you

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.900 
instead of actually using a ribbing you
can<00:02:46.390> use<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.750> mono<00:02:47.019> as<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> ribbing<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.910> secure

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
can use the mono as a ribbing and secure

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.710 
can use the mono as a ribbing and secure
down<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:50.280> materials<00:02:51.510> trim<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.630> up<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.870> little

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
down the materials trim it up a little

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.750 
down the materials trim it up a little
it<00:02:55.720> actually<00:02:56.019> gives<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.290> lifelike<00:02:56.799> luster<00:02:57.519> as

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
it actually gives a lifelike luster as

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.339 
it actually gives a lifelike luster as
well<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.930> certainly<00:02:59.709> light<00:03:03.989> okay<00:03:04.989> right<00:03:05.200> now

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
well as certainly light okay right now

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.300 
well as certainly light okay right now
we're<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.680> tie<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.130> under<00:03:06.400> wing

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
we're going to tie in the under wing

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.100 
we're going to tie in the under wing
