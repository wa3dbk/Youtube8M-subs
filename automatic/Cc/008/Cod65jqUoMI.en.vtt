00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going to show you a quick example of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.440 
going to show you a quick example of
what<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.650> Ronaldo<00:01:22.650> chop<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.759> imagine<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
what the Ronaldo chop is so imagine the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.969 
what the Ronaldo chop is so imagine the
Bulls<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.930> fee<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.259> gonna<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> slow

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
Bulls at your fee I'm gonna do in slow

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:35.090 
Bulls at your fee I'm gonna do in slow
motion<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:33.320> see<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> skill

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
motion so it's and it see so the skill

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.050 
motion so it's and it see so the skill
is<00:01:35.310> very<00:01:35.610> simple<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.229> used<00:01:37.619> effectively

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
is very simple but if used effectively

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
is very simple but if used effectively
you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.780> defenders<00:01:40.290> water<00:01:40.500> time<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you can go on defenders water time so

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.550 
you can go on defenders water time so
I'll<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> again<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.170> bit

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I'll do it again and this time a bit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.180 
I'll do it again and this time a bit
faster<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.479> it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.490 

did<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.280> see<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.600> also<00:01:53.750> mix<00:01:54.320> it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
did you see and you can also mix it

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.410 
did you see and you can also mix it
about<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.010> add<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> second<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.150> well<00:01:56.180> so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
about and add a second one as well so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:10.419 
about and add a second one as well so
say<00:01:57.409> kid<00:01:57.650> go<00:02:06.909> now<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.270> don't<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.440> another

defenders<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.630> front<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:34.040> push<00:02:34.459> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
defenders in front of you you push the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:58.780 
defenders in front of you you push the
ball<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:38.530> again<00:02:39.530> it

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:09.979 

they<00:02:59.790> will<00:03:01.489> cite<00:03:07.609> this<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.299> war

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
they will cite this and this that is war

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:20.839 
they will cite this and this that is war
so<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:16.200> moved<00:03:16.469> it<00:03:16.650> boil<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.519> from

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
so it you moved it boil in it and from

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.270 
so it you moved it boil in it and from
this<00:03:21.060> side<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.450> war<00:03:24.260> okay<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.769> second

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
this side is war okay so the second

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.659 
this side is war okay so the second
skill<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.819> known<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.959> step<00:03:28.290> over<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.459> is

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
skill is known as the step over this is

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.119 
skill is known as the step over this is
another<00:03:29.939> offensive<00:03:30.689> move<00:03:30.930> it's<00:03:31.590> used<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.099> lot

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
another offensive move it's used a lot

another offensive move it's used a lot
by<00:03:32.489> Flair<00:03:32.970> players<00:03:33.329> by<00:03:33.599> technical<00:03:34.200> players

direction<00:03:45.090> you're<00:03:45.359> going<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.659> go<00:03:45.930> because<00:03:46.439> of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
direction you're going to go because of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.319 
direction you're going to go because of
the<00:03:46.950> movement<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.579> feet<00:03:47.760> over<00:03:47.939> the<00:03:48.120> ball

gonna give you a quick show in in in

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.219 
gonna give you a quick show in in in
slow<00:03:59.129> motion<00:03:59.400> basically<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.810> boos<00:04:01.019> at

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
slow motion basically so the boos at

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:06.250 
slow motion basically so the boos at
your<00:04:01.379> feet<00:04:01.620> you're<00:04:01.799> running<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.319> 1c<00:04:04.319> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
your feet you're running and it's 1c and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.809 
your feet you're running and it's 1c and
wood<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.470> from<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.739> side<00:04:07.799> is<00:04:08.069> what<00:04:08.250> 1<00:04:08.970> c1

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
wood in from this side is what 1 c1

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.589 
wood in from this side is what 1 c1
oh<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.889> whole<00:04:14.040> idea<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.639> skill<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:15.269> would

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
oh the whole idea of the skill it would

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.569 
oh the whole idea of the skill it would
be<00:04:15.989> for<00:04:16.169> your<00:04:16.229> feet<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.829> go<00:04:17.010> over<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
be for your feet and you go over the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.420 
be for your feet and you go over the
ball<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.780> when<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.049> do<00:04:19.199> step<00:04:19.560> overs<00:04:20.010> you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
ball so when you do step overs you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.339 
ball so when you do step overs you
choose<00:04:20.759> a<00:04:20.789> direction<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.659> go<00:04:21.810> around<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
choose a direction to go around the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.469 
choose a direction to go around the
defender<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.520> I'm<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.000> going<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.270> show<00:04:24.419> you

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
that quickly again so the ball is that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.529 
that quickly again so the ball is that
your<00:04:28.470> feet<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.919> you're<00:04:29.580> going<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.300> I'm

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:47.600 

and<00:04:38.830> now<00:04:39.100> I'm<00:04:39.400> going<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.880> go<00:04:40.030> back<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:46.170> so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
and now I'm going to go back so it's so

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.990 
and now I'm going to go back so it's so
and<00:04:48.870> another<00:04:49.870> thing<00:04:50.200> about<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.860> goes<00:04:51.220> well

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
and another thing about this goes well

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.790 
and another thing about this goes well
when<00:04:52.270> your<00:04:52.420> foot<00:04:52.630> goes<00:04:52.840> over<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> bow

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
when your foot goes over the bow

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.160 
when your foot goes over the bow
make<00:04:54.130> sure<00:04:54.340> your<00:04:54.550> leg<00:04:54.730> is<00:04:54.910> straight<00:04:55.270> because

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
make sure your leg is straight because

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.050 
make sure your leg is straight because
if<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.830> like<00:04:57.010> this<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.310> might<00:04:57.670> mistakenly

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
if it's like this you might mistakenly

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.000 
if it's like this you might mistakenly
hit<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.600> wall<00:04:58.780> behind<00:04:59.440> you

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
hit the wall behind you

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.550 
hit the wall behind you
so<00:05:00.400> when<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.480> step<00:05:01.780> over<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.200> make<00:05:02.380> sure

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
so when you do a step over you make sure

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.520 
so when you do a step over you make sure
your<00:05:02.650> leg<00:05:02.830> straight<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.310> it's<00:05:03.490> one<00:05:04.030> two<00:05:04.530> and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
your leg straight so it's one two and

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.700 
your leg straight so it's one two and
you<00:05:06.520> just<00:05:06.850> do<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.600> really<00:05:08.410> fast<00:05:10.080> like<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.350> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
you just do it really fast like that and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.370 
you just do it really fast like that and
so<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:15.520> let's<00:05:16.030> say<00:05:16.300> now<00:05:16.330> you're<00:05:16.840> running<00:05:17.020> with

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
so so let's say now you're running with

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:26.460 
so so let's say now you're running with
