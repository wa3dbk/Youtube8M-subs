00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 1 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.710
 that's welcome so in part 2 of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 the lesson for olive tree is delivered so 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 we're going to do the first verse actually 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
 so for what left hand chords 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 it's a bit like what we saw in 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.530
 the introduction is a step the same 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 agreements there is just one more agreement 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.860
 so these women still ignore the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 dream is soft major 7th the introduction 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 also the 1000th all still like 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.110
 the introduction by cons in the end we will 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.990
 add this chord that the rope if 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.990
 flat minor so 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 1 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.220
 with the melody that's what I tried 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.220
 to go as far as possible 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 1 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.060
 so at this passage here we have 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.540
 changes on the agreements so that will be 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.220
 familiar 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.960
 E flat major 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.960
 and if flat major this shot
