00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
as well now I use a toner on my face and
I<00:01:27.180> find<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> non-alcoholic<00:01:28.229> toner<00:01:29.100> works

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I find that a non-alcoholic toner works

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
I find that a non-alcoholic toner works
best<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.689> doesn't<00:01:31.020> burn<00:01:31.170> like

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
best for me because it doesn't burn like

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.130 
best for me because it doesn't burn like
a<00:01:31.500> mofo<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.340> toners<00:01:33.150> helps<00:01:33.479> catch<00:01:33.750> soap

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
a mofo and toners helps catch soap

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
a mofo and toners helps catch soap
debris<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> anything<00:01:35.070> else<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
debris and anything else that the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.999 
debris and anything else that the
cleaner<00:01:36.090> didn't<00:01:36.450> catch<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:37.350> helps<00:01:37.619> minimize

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
cleaner didn't catch also helps minimize

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
cleaner didn't catch also helps minimize
your<00:01:38.220> pores<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> let<00:01:39.689> my
