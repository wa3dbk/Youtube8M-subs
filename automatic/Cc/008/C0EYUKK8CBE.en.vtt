00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.600
 the fruit salads are easy to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.549
 do and today I will do a demonstration of 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 how to make one that looks as good as 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.370
 knows 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 you are udon barman registered dietitian and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.450
 today I will be doing a colorful and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 healthy fruit salad will be 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.200
 asking why I'm going to teach them to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 make a fruit salad if only the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.520
 short and place them in a deep dish and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.079
 that's true but let me tell you 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.210
 that the mixtures of fruits are very 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.340
 healthy and fruits can have a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 greater antioxidant effect when 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.180
 eat together that when consumed by 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 separate I've asked my friend 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 jiang from the production team that comes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.320
 and it helps me to be my fruit salad 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 today they use olayan as 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.309
 these are fine and how are you 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.969
 I bet you've never made a salad 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.070
 of fruits 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 maybe once or twice I already did the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 preparation work I have cut the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.769
 most of our fruit but I'm going to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 leave mixtures well while 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.780
 I talk a little about why I use 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.179
 these fruits this is my favorite mix 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.339
 I started with the watermelon the watermelon is 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.860
 crunchy and also have a lot of lycopene 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 which is the red pigment the same as 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.970
 you find in tomatoes is very 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.280
 healthy let's go ahead and place 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.380
 if I like to use these two fruits as 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 foundation of my fruit salad the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.210
 pineapple has a lot of vitamin c too 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.430
 a lot of fiber and this adds a lot 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.530
 volume to our salad the next 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.110
 which I like to place a variety 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.240
 of berries you will notice that all these berries 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.369
 they are red and purple they all have the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 same components that are healthy for the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.290
 heart so let's keep putting the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 all there our healthy berries 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.300
 for the heart look how beautiful they will look 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 and we have not even mixed yet here 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.410
 there's a bit of kiwi and I like it because 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.390
 add the green color there are not many 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.220
 fruits that have this green so vivid 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.100
 It has some seeds that give us fiber 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.649
 that green color comes from lutein other 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.780
 pigment that helps protect your eyes and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.300
 finally have some mango here 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.770
 add all the mixture the mango is 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.780
 one of the richest fruits in 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.710
 beta carotene which your body 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.350
 transforms into vitamin 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.650
 and this can be known because of the beautiful 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.170
 yellow color can start to mix and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.910
 while doing so I'll ask you if 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 have you ever seen in the I have idea 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.920
 what is that good this is my fruit 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 exotic that's something called rambutan and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.270
 I have to admit that until yesterday I never 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.490
 I had eaten one of these but I thought that 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.560
 It would be very fun to place something exotic 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.750
 in our fruit salad so 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.330
 we will see this together this is a fruit 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.310
 little one has a little fluff and the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.830
 way to prepare it is to cut around 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 from the center when you cut it you'll notice that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 you have cut the skin and that the fruit is 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.940
 in the center inside you can see this 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.890
 small and perfect tropical fruit te 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.870
 I notice that there is a small seed there 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.030
 inside so they have to be very 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.820
 careful if you want to eat that whole 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 do not drown with the seed and this 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.170
 has vitamin c like most of the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.700
 tropical fruits so I will not cut 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.980
 a little piece so you can 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.570
 try it but I think I'll put it in the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 fruit salad because I think 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.110
 funny people will ask why 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.070
 I'm putting boiled eggs in my 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.140
 salad 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.250
 would you help me cut the rest 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.200
 I would love 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.140
 I'm going to give the board so you can bite here 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.640
 you have while jean cuts the rambutan and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.640
 our salad is practically 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.680
 finished is beautiful it is colorful and the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.630
 another wonderful thing about mixing 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.810
 these fruits together is vitamin c 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.940
 natural that is there acting 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.680
 as an antioxidant so not 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.350
 we need to worry because our 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.260
 Fruit you can put coffee will remain 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.680
 fresh and healthy for hours and really 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.930
 they do not need anything else 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.109
 we can put some small strips of 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.910
 mint if we want here goes the hard-boiled egg 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:55.700
 not the rambutan 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.410
 we put the mind and there they have it 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.410
 beautiful and healthy
