00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.200
 Well, as promised by the 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.819
 release of this program if it came to 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.480
 5 subscribers and the king of 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.299
 productions 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.839
 and a week but as it was fulfilled 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:18.579
 then 80 reproductions were made 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.320
 a little more and spend the 5 subscribers 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.439
 then we will release the code of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.630
 this program the purposes are educational 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.449
 so they see the application have a 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.110
 example how batteries are used the list 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:37.850
 and the double list according to solitary truth 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.220
 this ends are educational and not what 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.210
 I do in order for students to do 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.770
 fraud code that they did 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.469
 so how can you guys see here 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.109
 I did a little fret this program a 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.610
 Little mistake is suddenly easy 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:57.370
 solve it but between him 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.020
 the code relax that there is maybe you 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.670
 I put a little more this one not like 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.550
 You see, it hangs on this 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.460
 image here that he breaks and I have not 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.670
 cleaned again in the image or not the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.370
 updated the list list that I'm not going 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
 to say what it is but when I give here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.250
 click here 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.430
 rudy clay I know 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.070
 the image is deleted by the pp of the list 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.800
 I update then I am the only one who 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.960
 he has truth he follows the program 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.150
 functional says yes it wins 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 well do not lose it because there is no time 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.370
 You can take the song in a letter when 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.630
 want and decidedly do not change the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.030
 physical appearance 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.440
 I leave it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.440
 and well, well 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.810
 enjoy it and I would like to ask you 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.580
 also why do they want someone 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.280
 next video I was thinking about doing 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.790
 a game tutorial maybe start 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 a game from scratch really and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.600
 again make this dynamic come 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.430
 to so many subscribers and so many 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.500
 reproductions release the code of 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.350
 I play strings but I'm also going to do 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.840
 a tutorial on how to make good games 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.010
 then it is subscribe they are like us 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.010
