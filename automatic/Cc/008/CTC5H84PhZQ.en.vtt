00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.460
 hall the meute there is a photo of me 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.750
 because I was just with my but eternal 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.330
 shopping and I think that is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.469
 pretty much our favorite supermarket and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.049
 I thought I just show you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820
 what bought so much for me 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 wanted to cook something today and somehow 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.850
 we had no vegetables there 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 that's why we kept having that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.930
 we shop were always in bags 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.400
 that's why this is the first one here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 bag 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.220
 we do not even use it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 again and again until they break sometime 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.510
 that's why we do that and so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 on the table are a few things that I do 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 show you now first and indeed have 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 We bought two packs of apple 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.329
 very fast away with us because of that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 we took two with us and for 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 This delicious I would be very 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.190
 stupid that everything is always this bag 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 have to pack because I do not know that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 is environmentally friendly but has its own 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.039
 idea what you do about it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 it's a bit hard otherwise too 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.489
 transport so you have 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 can do any things 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 write me that bitter then we come 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 to a magazine that I bought myself 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 so far that they have me 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 diet mainly vegan and such 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 continue and I have this magazine 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 seen that addressed me at the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 Title went there I thought so already 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.390
 What kind of magazine is that? 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.920
 then i saw that ellie 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 Goulding on the suitcase is there thought 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 oh my god, that's me forever 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.369
 what I would like to have and then stand 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.020
 because even the vegan magazine and yes 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 I've never had that and I have never had 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 I thought I would just take a look 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 there is not necessarily just food 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.580
 but there is much else to it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 example here for example I know 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 not exactly what that should be 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 but that is for example in and that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.750
 costs a bit much 350 and it is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.009
 not so fat but well I have it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.229
 now just taken 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.119
 let's see how it is with ours 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.409
 edeka is also available tchibo and I love 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.159
 the tchibo articles always like that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.800
 great stuff 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.690
 and there we have such a key for 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.929
 salad for example bought a few 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.179
 crates of tomatoes automatically from ilka of 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.470
 the simple and yes I like me 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.810
 not so much i like it always 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.360
 love not in its packaging 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.950
 but why individual but we 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.570
 are actually quite nice the name 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.459
 Fresh spatially bought up for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.140
 me but this for my dad because 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.640
 he somehow I think the only one in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.680
 our house is look fresh endorf 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.900
 I like to drink all our drink 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.920
 beloved soy rice milk then we have 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.630
 such cowards bought what they read 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.370
 it just could not fall 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.320
 the dried cost is two euros 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.880
 not so important now but i thought 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.040
 I'll try it because they like it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.489
 I dry fruit and so on all the way 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.989
 with pleasure 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.640
 then i will have this package first 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.660
 I took it very much 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 but then suddenly we have the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.829
 ingredients changed I do not know why 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.110
 no other was suddenly there others 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.760
 ingredients and yes I have now 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.440
 befriended by those who have before 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.000
 tasted better but they are 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.860
 also okay that you can eat well 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.460
 if you do not mind cooking 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.960
 but by simply 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.000
 insert a key into the microwave 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.760
 finish and then have it finished 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.660
 Here we are so double pack of Salatherzen 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.730
 or salad with this salad I like 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.280
 actually i believe in feldsalat on 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.500
 Favorite iceberg lettuce is not like that 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.910
 quite healthy because many pesticides and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.860
 are in there and that at all 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.500
 contains no nutrients and therefore 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.150
 always buy such a salad because we stop 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.850
 also tastes delicious and then we have 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 another pop taken away from this one 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.110
 brand find such a packaging the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
 there are also at aldi 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.630
 they always last longer than those in 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.250
 his packaging somehow stay that way 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.280
 so durable longer and longer I do not know 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.080
 what it is but I believe will 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.050
 really delicious and even come from 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.690
 taken with it and that is Germany 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.480
 a vegan ice cream is 100% on it 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.730
 vegetable and jannis is not 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.100
 healthy so there is sugar in it and everything 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.360
 possible but i thought i would try it 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.860
 just because they succeeded 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.710
 I'm interested in looking like one 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.940
 abnormal munich and I try I 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.220
 should that of the very fast in the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.810
 pack freezer because that's it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.120
 pretty melted writes on everyone 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.820
 case recognized as well as writes 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.010
 a new one will not be over now 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.300
 Things think that bury us 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.910
 bought vegetable oil from grabs because yes 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.140
 For example, do not use olive oil for frying 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.940
 That's why you always use that way 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.130
 Something we have married a few 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.270
 bought and I prefer to dream on 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.940
 dearest with others we as well 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.620
 developed 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.350
 bought that are so many here too 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.540
 sunflowers and so on that probably completely 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.430
 okay so my favorite book is 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.620
 not there we also heard 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.480
 taken with me because of the name 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.470
 I like you and I already have them 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.480
 I actually buy it from everyone 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.360
 I buy it only when the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.790
 look like this 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.960
 that's the edeka organic banana now 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.240
 I do not like the whole so not 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.980
 right is not quite so good but the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.930
 have to dotted with me so black 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.450
 is eating then we have one 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.660
 pineapple juice pineapple oranges and 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.150
 marco bought from the lk 1 brand and am 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.560
 I have never had but I think I am 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
 sometimes I really want juice 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.650
 and then we have one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.250
 bought zucchini because I always do 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.710
 quite like 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.660
 zucchini noodles or just go one like that 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.370
 vegetable pan zucchini rhein-main am 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.040
 Best it is a breakdown chips purchased 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.320
 net mails easily put fine 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.080
 from lorenz and that's what I looked like 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.030
 if he's so bent on chips me 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.460
 even at least rich take where 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.310
 okay ingredients and they are even 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.080
 still top sunflower oil for more than 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.419
 three and in most others 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.610
 always have everything in it everything 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.070
 really packed what is just gone and 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.310
 That's why I let off chips often 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.870
 which can be at least buy 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.060
 are quite healthy there are of course 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.550
 ingredients without electricity without 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.540
 preservatives and gluten free 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.970
 then we have two different ones 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.690
 40 varieties purchased and 2000 so 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.030
 a bit smaller 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.830
 that here quite large then I have 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.800
 a sentence found by becker's 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.450
 best of the breakfast juice and there are 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 very different things in it and 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.770
 That's why I thought that with you 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.230
 further on, why is multivitamin juice 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.700
 yes a big head because profi is mine 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.620
 favorite vegetables and then I have 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.260
 also had this bio at edeka 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.710
 avocados 1 6 I did not think like that 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.540
 one with 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.430
 that's about two now 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.680
 there then I once again one of 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.740
 my beloved intensively taken 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.760
 namely the tropical three papers of 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.700
 copenhagen 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.100
 this dinkelborg then right 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:33.409
 ingredients that bothers only post 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:35.939
 is that this game quite complicated 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.370
 then he has a pack of greek 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.289
 Yoghurt bought it as well 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.479

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.289
 and i find you so delicious i can serve you 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.740
 Definitely recommend a pack 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.969
 with seven effect costs two euros 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.979
 not the cheapest now 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.620
 but they are just so delicious 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.999
 taste right so finally came and 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.729
 shall I have sweets 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:02.460
 had that were so switched panel 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.839
 Pauline and this is easy to wake up 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.839
 yes, just try the will 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:08.999
 there is a steirer with you and there is a steirer 

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:11.219
 So do not be scared but if you are 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:13.349
 Just get out and ready to rescue them 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.849
 yes and that was our little one 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.710
 part very likely to be happy here 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.240
 And those are the things we do 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.550
 mostly shopping so that's it 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.020
 typical things about us our purchase 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.699
 always there we are the comments
