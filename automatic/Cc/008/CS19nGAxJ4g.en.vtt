don't<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.160> isn't<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
don't think there is one that isn't the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.420 
don't think there is one that isn't the
J<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:35.820> they're<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.540> legit<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:38.280> should

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
J actually they're all legit you should

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
J actually they're all legit you should
use<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.079> sometimes<00:00:40.079> moves<00:00:40.770> might<00:00:40.980> not

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
use it because sometimes moves might not

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
use it because sometimes moves might not
be<00:00:41.579> legit<00:00:41.879> together<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> way

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
be legit together because of the way

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.720 
be legit together because of the way
that<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> breeding<00:00:44.309> works<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that the you know the breeding works you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.180 
that the you know the breeding works you
can't<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.149> certain<00:00:45.840> moves<00:00:46.020> together

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
can't have certain moves together

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.630 
can't have certain moves together
because<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.489> can't<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> within<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> game

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
because you can't do it within the game

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.040 
because you can't do it within the game
and<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.180> might<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.600> event<00:00:51.840> move

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and you know it might be an event move

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
and you know it might be an event move
things<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.480> want<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
things like that and so what you want to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
things like that and so what you want to
do<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> want<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> make<00:00:55.289> sure<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:56.629> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
do is you want to make sure they you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.680 
do is you want to make sure they you
know<00:00:57.690> copy<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> pretty<00:00:58.289> much<00:00:58.320> exactly<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> for

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
know copy of pretty much exactly so for

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.979 
know copy of pretty much exactly so for
example<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.620> substitute<00:01:02.480> change<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
example you know substitute change the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.510 
example you know substitute change the
nature<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.559> calm<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:07.250> we've<00:01:08.250> got<00:01:08.369> black

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
nature to calm and we've got black

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
nature to calm and we've got black
sludge<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> chlorophyll<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.350> all

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
sludge and chlorophyll so that's all

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
sludge and chlorophyll so that's all
good<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> Ivy's<00:01:14.210> we<00:01:15.210> need<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.530> attack

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
good and so Ivy's we need to an attack

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.660 
good and so Ivy's we need to an attack
and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.700> 30<00:01:18.060> special<00:01:18.479> attack<00:01:18.689> 30<00:01:19.100> speed<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and then 30 special attack 30 speed and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
and then 30 special attack 30 speed and
that<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.060> give<00:01:21.180> us<00:01:21.210> hidden<00:01:21.570> power<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.049> fire

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that will give us hidden power of fire

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.609 
that will give us hidden power of fire
and<00:01:22.950> that'll<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.240> coverage<00:01:24.630> move<00:01:24.869> then

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and that'll be a good coverage move then

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
and that'll be a good coverage move then
we'll<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:26.150> two<00:01:27.150> five<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:29.130> HP<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
we'll need two five two in our HP to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
we'll need two five two in our HP to
give<00:01:30.450> us<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:30.990> bulk<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.650> then

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
know I just need that much speed because

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.920 
know I just need that much speed because
we're<00:01:45.300> gonna<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.510> using<00:01:47.420> zoom<00:01:48.420> abusing<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
we're gonna be using zoom abusing this

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.640 
we're gonna be using zoom abusing this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
game you won't be able to go online with

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.850 
game you won't be able to go online with
the<00:02:02.580> pokemon<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.150> make<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.860> there

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the pokemon that you make and there

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.770 
the pokemon that you make and there
might<00:02:05.010> be<00:02:05.040> other<00:02:05.580> problems<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> yeah<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
might be other problems so yeah and the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.710 
might be other problems so yeah and the
reason<00:02:09.899> why<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.560> generally<00:02:11.040> 508<00:02:11.880> V's<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
reason why it's generally 508 V's is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.560 
reason why it's generally 508 V's is
because<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:14.100> last<00:02:14.280> two<00:02:14.640> won't<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.270> be

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
because the last two won't actually be

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.040 
because the last two won't actually be
beneficial<00:02:16.700> seeing<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.850> get<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.570> every<00:02:18.780> four

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
beneficial seeing you get for every four

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.380 
beneficial seeing you get for every four
four<00:02:19.800> V's<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.490> get<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.510> point<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.560> stat

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
four V's you get one one point in a stat

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.780 
four V's you get one one point in a stat
and<00:02:24.560> yeah<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> last<00:02:26.100> two<00:02:26.400> are<00:02:26.490> pretty<00:02:26.670> much

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and yeah so the last two are pretty much

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.260 
and yeah so the last two are pretty much
useless<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> once<00:02:30.120> you've

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
useless and then what you once you've

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.430 
useless and then what you once you've
done<00:02:30.420> all<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:32.790> moves<00:02:33.260> lead<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
done all that and your moves lead to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.520 
done all that and your moves lead to
seed<00:02:35.959> substitute

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.550 

I<00:02:39.590> change<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.670> everything's<00:02:41.630> sorted<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.500> you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
