so yeah and I can walk up the stairs and

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.300 
so yeah and I can walk up the stairs and
you<00:04:07.840> could<00:04:07.989> make<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:08.379> like<00:04:08.650> instead<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.069> make

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
you could make this like instead of make

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.850 
you could make this like instead of make
it<00:04:09.340> like<00:04:09.810> one<00:04:10.810> two<00:04:11.019> three<00:04:11.200> four<00:04:11.409> you<00:04:11.590> can<00:04:11.709> make

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
it like one two three four you can make

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.170 
it like one two three four you can make
it<00:04:11.980> like<00:04:12.069> 4<00:04:12.370> 8<00:04:12.730> 16<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:14.430> 32<00:04:15.430> like<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.909> can<00:04:16.060> make

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
it like 4 8 16 and 32 like you can make

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.270 
it like 4 8 16 and 32 like you can make
it<00:04:16.299> way<00:04:16.419> different<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.470> now<00:04:17.650> it's<00:04:17.829> an<00:04:18.040> end<00:04:18.160> do

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
it way different so now it's an end do

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.420 
it way different so now it's an end do
this<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:20.169> I've<00:04:20.260> also<00:04:20.410> invented<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.070> like

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
this and I've also invented this like

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.610 
this and I've also invented this like
building<00:04:22.210> station<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.930> get<00:04:23.080> two<00:04:23.290> sticks

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
building station so you get two sticks

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.750 
building station so you get two sticks
so<00:04:24.520> I'll<00:04:24.610> make<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.850> full<00:04:25.030> set<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.360> armor<00:04:25.630> first

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.590 

so<00:04:31.110> chess<00:04:32.110> played<00:04:32.350> helmet<00:04:32.800> legs<00:04:33.130> are<00:04:33.790> boots

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
so chess played helmet legs are boots

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.430 
so chess played helmet legs are boots
and<00:04:34.870> then<00:04:34.990> legs<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:36.630> then<00:04:37.630> we<00:04:37.750> got<00:04:37.900> two<00:04:38.110> sticks

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
and then legs and then we got two sticks

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.100 
and then legs and then we got two sticks
to<00:04:38.650> make<00:04:38.800> our<00:04:39.100> kick<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.350> simply<00:04:41.949> back<00:04:42.340> off

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to make our kick and you simply back off

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.360 
to make our kick and you simply back off
and<00:04:44.110> come<00:04:44.139> back<00:04:44.710> on<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:47.560> can<00:04:47.740> put<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.949> sword

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
and come back on and you can put a sword

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.610 
and come back on and you can put a sword
and<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:50.440> back<00:04:50.740> off<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.780> back<00:04:52.780> on

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
and then back off and back on

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.010 
and then back off and back on
and<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:55.130> can<00:04:55.310> build<00:04:55.580> our<00:04:55.970> acts<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.910> back<00:04:59.780> off

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
and we can build our acts and back off

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.700 
and we can build our acts and back off
and<00:05:01.150> back<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:03.050> we<00:05:03.979> can<00:05:04.010> build<00:05:04.340> our<00:05:04.820> shovel

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
and back on and we can build our shovel

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.379 
and back on and we can build our shovel
and<00:05:06.710> you're<00:05:07.160> evidently<00:05:07.370> going<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.940> have<00:05:08.060> one

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
and you're evidently going to have one

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.900 
and you're evidently going to have one
extra<00:05:08.750> stick<00:05:09.320> because<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.220> sword<00:05:10.490> only<00:05:10.699> needs

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
extra stick because the sword only needs

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.460 
extra stick because the sword only needs
one<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.330> can<00:05:11.449> just<00:05:11.479> refill<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.050> there<00:05:12.260> and

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
one so you can just refill it there and

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.159 
one so you can just refill it there and
then<00:05:13.630> yeah<00:05:14.630> you're<00:05:15.169> good<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.440> go<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:17.169> yeah

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
then yeah you're good to go and yeah

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.250 
then yeah you're good to go and yeah
