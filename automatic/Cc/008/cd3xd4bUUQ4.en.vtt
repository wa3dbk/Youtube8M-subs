Chinese<00:00:57.480> medicine<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.789> association

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
Chinese medicine we see the association

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
Chinese medicine we see the association
between<00:00:59.820> allergies<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.199> lung<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> skin

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
between allergies the lung and the skin

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.690 
between allergies the lung and the skin
so<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.000> three<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.049> addressed

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
so all three of these can be addressed

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.620 
so all three of these can be addressed
through<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:06.000> points<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> are

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
through some points that are

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
through some points that are
particularly<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.680> strengthening<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
particularly good for strengthening the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.260 
particularly good for strengthening the
lung<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.030> we're<00:01:12.180> going

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
lung in this case and then we're going

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.109 
lung in this case and then we're going
to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:14.549> acne<00:01:15.000> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
to do one when we see the acne in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.149 
to do one when we see the acne in
particular<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.250> oftentimes<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.580> flare-up

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
particular and oftentimes the flare-up

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
particular and oftentimes the flare-up
of<00:01:20.159> allergies<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.630> heat<00:01:21.869> associated

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
of allergies we see some heat associated

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
of allergies we see some heat associated
with<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
with it so we're going to do one that

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
with it so we're going to do one that
helps<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.630> rid<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
helps to get rid of a little bit of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
helps to get rid of a little bit of the
heat<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.970> causes<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> redness<00:01:28.170> associated

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
heat that causes the redness associated

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
heat that causes the redness associated
with<00:01:28.829> acne<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.180> leave<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.509> points

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
with acne so we can leave these points

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
with acne so we can leave these points
in<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:32.100> 20<00:01:32.700> minutes<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> most

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
in for about 20 minutes will be the most

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
in for about 20 minutes will be the most
effective<00:01:34.320> approach<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.610> once<00:01:35.790> we've
