of these three in Qatar because guitar

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.690 
of these three in Qatar because guitar
really<00:01:52.120> is<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.390> center<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:53.370> politics<00:01:54.370> here<00:01:54.580> in

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.680 

one<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> major<00:02:03.400> differences<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.570> we

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
one of the major differences that we

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.630 
one of the major differences that we
have<00:02:04.840> very<00:02:05.290> small<00:02:05.380> classes<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.340> largest

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
have very small classes the largest

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.620 
have very small classes the largest
classes<00:02:07.240> are<00:02:07.420> 15<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.020> 20<00:02:08.350> people<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.150> work

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
classes are 15 to 20 people you can work

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.330 
classes are 15 to 20 people you can work
very<00:02:10.690> directly<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.770> each<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.160> every

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
very directly with a each and every

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.700 
very directly with a each and every
individual<00:02:12.790> student<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.540> nearly<00:02:14.410> all<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
individual student I know nearly all the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.770 
individual student I know nearly all the
students<00:02:14.980> by<00:02:15.130> name<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:16.240> know<00:02:16.390> me<00:02:16.420> no<00:02:16.630> of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
students by name they know me no of

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450 
students by name they know me no of
course<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.470> that's<00:02:17.860> quite<00:02:18.040> different<00:02:18.130> from

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
course so that's quite different from

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.190 
course so that's quite different from
the<00:02:18.850> main<00:02:18.970> campus<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.930> me<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> whole

using that thesis and publishing it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.740 
using that thesis and publishing it
afterwards<00:03:24.580> which<00:03:24.730> was<00:03:24.880> which<00:03:25.300> was<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.480> really

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750

great opportunity for me and it opened a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920 
great opportunity for me and it opened a
lot<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.250> doors<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:28.690> were<00:03:28.780> so

many service trips so I'm not just kind
of<00:03:30.850> talking<00:03:31.090> about<00:03:31.480> theories<00:03:32.290> about

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
of talking about theories about

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.580 
of talking about theories about
partition<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.400> civil<00:03:34.030> strife<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.350> whatever

partition and civil strife and whatever

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.380 
partition and civil strife and whatever
I<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:35.920> went<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> Cyprus<00:03:36.790> i<00:03:37.060> went<00:03:37.239> to

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
I actually went to Cyprus i went to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.380 
I actually went to Cyprus i went to
rural<00:03:37.870> kentucky<00:03:38.410> building<00:03:38.709> houses<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:40.269> that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
rural kentucky building houses so that

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.120 
rural kentucky building houses so that
was<00:03:40.510> really<00:03:40.540> another<00:03:41.290> selling<00:03:41.739> point<00:03:41.769> when<00:03:42.100> i

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
was really another selling point when i

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.180 
was really another selling point when i
went<00:03:42.340> out<00:03:42.489> onto<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> job<00:03:43.180> market<00:03:43.330> again<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:45.160> i

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
went out onto the job market again so i

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.800 
went out onto the job market again so i
would<00:03:45.459> say<00:03:45.580> definitely<00:03:45.760> had<00:03:46.239> very<00:03:46.660> positive

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
would say definitely had very positive

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.330 
would say definitely had very positive
experience<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.739> it's<00:03:47.890> one<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> best

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
experience and it's one of the best

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.550 
experience and it's one of the best
decisions<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.790> made

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
decisions that I made

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.449 
decisions that I made
coming<00:03:50.560> from<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.769> high<00:03:50.890> school<00:03:51.069> system<00:03:51.370> which

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
coming from a high school system which

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.160 
coming from a high school system which
was<00:03:51.640> very<00:03:51.790> rigid<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.480> transition<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.959> college

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
was very rigid the transition to college

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.259 
was very rigid the transition to college
the<00:03:53.709> main<00:03:53.859> thing<00:03:53.890> it's<00:03:54.459> not<00:03:54.640> just<00:03:54.909> that<00:03:55.000> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
the main thing it's not just that the
