 did not say 876 grams of fillet with 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.200
 how to call with the skin, I basically think 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.910
 that I will try to cut the skin now 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.880

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.530
 this case configure themselves a little to me until 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.919
 it will infuse and then it's all 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.750
