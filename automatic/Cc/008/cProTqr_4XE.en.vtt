one<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.540> my<00:00:12.540> prototype<00:00:13.019> first

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
one is actually my prototype first

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
one is actually my prototype first
prototype<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.549> not<00:00:14.730> create<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:16.020> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
prototype and it's not create it's not a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.620 
prototype and it's not create it's not a
like<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> other<00:00:17.160> ones<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:18.060> were<00:00:18.270> creative

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
like the other ones that were creative

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.650 
like the other ones that were creative
to<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> mcedit<00:00:19.380> schematic<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> yeah<00:00:21.300> some

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to the mcedit schematic so yeah some

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.130 
to the mcedit schematic so yeah some
trees<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:23.510> I'm<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.600> gonna<00:00:24.720> skip<00:00:25.019> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
trees there I'm not gonna skip that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.679 
trees there I'm not gonna skip that
station<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.920> straight<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.689> Central

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
station and go straight on to Central

or we're not on our way I forgot I see
again<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.900> reset<00:03:38.760> here

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
again the reset here

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.050 
again the reset here
do<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.060> pair<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.299> me

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
do that to a pair of me

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.750 
do that to a pair of me
um<00:03:45.690> you'll<00:03:45.989> notice<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.410> yeah<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.670> sort<00:03:47.670> of

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
um you'll notice that yeah I sort of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280 
um you'll notice that yeah I sort of
design<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> stations<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:48.930> transparent

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
design the stations to be as transparent

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.800 
design the stations to be as transparent
as<00:03:49.680> possible<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.250> unlike<00:03:50.580> other<00:03:51.270> station

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
as possible this is unlike other station

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.220 
as possible this is unlike other station
designs<00:03:52.170> where<00:03:53.720> everything<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.810> underground

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
designs where everything is underground

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.410 
designs where everything is underground
or<00:03:55.470> hidden<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.190> if<00:03:56.430> someone<00:03:57.000> knows<00:03:57.239> what

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
or hidden so if someone knows what

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.780 
or hidden so if someone knows what
they're<00:03:57.569> doing<00:03:57.930> they<00:03:58.860> can<00:03:58.890> easily<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.489> jump

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
they're doing they can easily just jump

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.210 
they're doing they can easily just jump
in<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.000> fix<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.989> Boosters<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.830> like<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.069> did

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
in and fix the Boosters just like I did

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.580 
in and fix the Boosters just like I did
right<00:04:02.340> there<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.989> next<00:04:04.170> station<00:04:04.349> is

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
right there so the next station is

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.550 
right there so the next station is
Midway<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.660> it's<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:07.230> lagging<00:04:07.470> here

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
Midway and it's really lagging here

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.390 
Midway and it's really lagging here
hopefully<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:11.120> see<00:04:12.120> what<00:04:12.269> I'm<00:04:12.360> seeing<00:04:12.660> here

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
hopefully it's see what I'm seeing here

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.150 
hopefully it's see what I'm seeing here
Midway<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:16.410> another<00:04:16.620> center<00:04:16.980> platform

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
Midway is just another center platform

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.940 
Midway is just another center platform
station<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.419> built<00:04:18.660> into<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.650> side<00:04:19.829> of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
station but it's built into the side of

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.190 
station but it's built into the side of
a<00:04:20.010> hill<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.549> after<00:04:21.389> we<00:04:21.510> exit<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.959> station

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
a hill so after we exit the station

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840 
a hill so after we exit the station
we're<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> go<00:04:22.979> straight<00:04:23.280> into<00:04:23.460> little

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
we're going to go straight into little

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.300 
we're going to go straight into little
underground<00:04:24.750> tunnel

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.710 

okay<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:29.750> next<00:04:29.990> station<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.380> Sark<00:04:30.650> ocean<00:04:31.540> if<00:04:32.540> it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
okay so next station is Sark ocean if it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840 
okay so next station is Sark ocean if it
was<00:04:32.870> daytime<00:04:33.440> you're<00:04:33.710> probably<00:04:34.490> hard<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.760> see

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
was daytime you're probably hard to see

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.790 
was daytime you're probably hard to see
but<00:04:35.480> we're<00:04:35.720> actually<00:04:35.870> entering<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.380> desert

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
but we're actually entering a desert

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:49.330 
but we're actually entering a desert
area<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:42.080> go<00:04:42.290> over<00:04:42.380> there
