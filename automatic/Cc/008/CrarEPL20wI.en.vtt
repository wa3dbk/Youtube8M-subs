hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.079> saundarya<00:00:01.290> from<00:00:01.979> alpha

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys this is saundarya from alpha

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.710 
hey guys this is saundarya from alpha
technologies<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.000> you're<00:00:03.240> watching<00:00:03.419> the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
technologies and you're watching the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.320 
technologies and you're watching the
benchmarks<00:00:04.290> test<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.009> Huawei<00:00:05.400> honor<00:00:05.430> 4c

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
benchmarks test on the Huawei honor 4c

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
benchmarks test on the Huawei honor 4c
so<00:00:06.480> let's<00:00:06.660> begin<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> starting<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
so let's begin so starting off with the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
so let's begin so starting off with the
multi-touch<00:00:15.299> points<00:00:15.750> let's<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.619> how<00:00:16.830> many

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
multi-touch points let's see how many

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.910 
multi-touch points let's see how many
male<00:00:17.250> touch<00:00:17.490> points<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> happier<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> we

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
male touch points to be happier so we

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
male touch points to be happier so we
have<00:00:20.100> around<00:00:20.369> 10<00:00:20.550> multi-touch<00:00:21.060> points<00:00:21.480> now

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
have around 10 multi-touch points now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
have around 10 multi-touch points now
let's<00:00:22.500> take<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> look<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> CPC<00:00:23.550> application

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
let's take a look at the CPC application

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
let's take a look at the CPC application
so<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.570> teething<00:00:24.990> 620<00:00:25.650> processor<00:00:26.130> which

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
so we have teething 620 processor which

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.759 
so we have teething 620 processor which
is<00:00:26.340> clocked<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.910> 1.2<00:00:27.390> gigahertz<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
is clocked at 1.2 gigahertz it is

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009 
is clocked at 1.2 gigahertz it is
octa-core<00:00:29.220> processor<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
octa-core processor you can see all the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.090 
octa-core processor you can see all the
8<00:00:31.140> cores<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.130> Mali<00:00:32.399> 450<00:00:32.759> MP<00:00:33.239> GPU<00:00:33.860> let's<00:00:34.860> go

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
8 cores we have Mali 450 MP GPU let's go

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
8 cores we have Mali 450 MP GPU let's go
into<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> system<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
storage details at the bottom let's go
into<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> battery<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> battery

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
into the battery here is the battery

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.639 
into the battery here is the battery
information<00:00:53.690> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> sensors

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
information if you go into the sensors

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
information if you go into the sensors
we<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:56.039> light<00:00:56.309> sensor<00:00:56.699> proximity<00:00:56.899> magnetic

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
we have light sensor proximity magnetic

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
we have light sensor proximity magnetic
orientation<00:00:58.739> sensor<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> lot<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> sensors<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
orientation sensor and lot of sensors so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
orientation sensor and lot of sensors so
you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:01.020> by<00:01:01.770> pausing<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> video

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you can take a look by pausing the video

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
you can take a look by pausing the video
now<00:01:03.359> let's<00:01:03.600> run<00:01:03.780> quadrant<00:01:04.290> standard

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
now let's run quadrant standard

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.929 
now let's run quadrant standard
benchmark

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.440 

so<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.119> score<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.570> here<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.729> score<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.210> six

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
so the score is here the score is six

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.700 
so the score is here the score is six
thousand<00:01:19.840> three<00:01:19.869> hundred<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.350> ninety<00:01:20.680> one

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.319 
thousand three hundred and ninety one
and<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.070> can<00:01:21.219> see<00:01:21.369> all<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.640> details<00:01:22.060> at<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
and you can see all the details at the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.999 
and you can see all the details at the
bottom<00:01:22.689> over<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.850> ran<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.329> again<00:01:25.659> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
bottom over here I also ran it again and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.440 
bottom over here I also ran it again and
after<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.159> I<00:01:27.189> got<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.759> score<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.179> seven

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
after that I got the score of seven

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.060 
after that I got the score of seven
thousand<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.899> sixteen<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.740> see<00:01:29.890> all

was<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.329> benchmark<00:02:14.890> now<00:02:15.890> let's<00:02:16.129> run

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
was on to do benchmark now let's run

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.729 
was on to do benchmark now let's run
Nina<00:02:17.209> mock<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.660> benchmark<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.560> FPS

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
Nina mock to benchmark to see the FPS

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.870 
Nina mock to benchmark to see the FPS
score<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.610> device

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
