sizzling<00:00:07.140> sunset<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.950> an<00:00:08.280> excellent

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
sizzling sunset is an excellent

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.339 
sizzling sunset is an excellent
experiment<00:00:09.510> because<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:09.990> both<00:00:10.139> an

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
experiment because it's both an

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.870 
experiment because it's both an
endothermic<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.099> an<00:00:11.280> exothermic<00:00:11.610> reaction

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
endothermic and an exothermic reaction

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
endothermic and an exothermic reaction
and<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.870> see<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> effect<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.969> an

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and you can see the effect of an

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.570 
and you can see the effect of an
acid-base<00:00:15.570> indicator<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.220> environment

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
acid-base indicator in that environment

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.570 
acid-base indicator in that environment
what<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.570> need<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.859> large

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
what you need is you need a large

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.109 
what you need is you need a large
resealable<00:00:21.390> sandwich<00:00:22.140> bag<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.910> first

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
resealable sandwich bag and the first

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.450 
resealable sandwich bag and the first
thing<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.140> add<00:00:25.590> several

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
thing that you do is you add several

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
thing that you do is you add several
ounces<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.470> water<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> bag<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:30.539> doesn't

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
ounces of water to the bag it doesn't

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
ounces of water to the bag it doesn't
need<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.349> precise<00:00:31.890> amount<00:00:32.059> but<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> works

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
need to be a precise amount but it works

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.250 
need to be a precise amount but it works
best<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> water<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:35.660> room<00:00:36.660> temperature

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
best if the water is room temperature

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.690 
best if the water is room temperature
and<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> main<00:00:37.920> reason<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.670> because

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and the main reason for that is because

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
and the main reason for that is because
the<00:00:39.180> first<00:00:39.210> thing<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> add<00:00:40.110> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the first thing that you can add is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.889 
the first thing that you can add is
calcium<00:00:40.890> chloride<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> component

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
calcium chloride this is a component

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.619 
calcium chloride this is a component
that's<00:00:43.200> added<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.010> snow<00:00:44.640> melter<00:00:45.030> solutions

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that's added to snow melter solutions

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
that's added to snow melter solutions
and<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.440> custom<00:00:46.950> chloride<00:00:47.309> comes<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and what custom chloride comes in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.889 
and what custom chloride comes in
contact<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:49.129> water<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.610> actually

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
contact with water it actually

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.020 
contact with water it actually
dissociates<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> byproducts<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
dissociates and one of the byproducts of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.189 
dissociates and one of the byproducts of
the<00:00:54.149> dissociation<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.350> sulfuric<00:00:56.219> acid<00:00:57.199> but

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the dissociation is sulfuric acid but

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
the dissociation is sulfuric acid but
the<00:00:58.410> kids<00:00:58.680> immediately<00:00:59.250> notice<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.030> roll

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the kids immediately notice as they roll

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
the kids immediately notice as they roll
their<00:01:00.510> fingers<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> pellets<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
their fingers on the pellets is that the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
their fingers on the pellets is that the
temperature<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> water<00:01:02.940> goes<00:01:03.239> way<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:04.049> up

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
temperature the water goes way way up

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.460 
temperature the water goes way way up
it'll<00:01:04.559> jump<00:01:04.769> by<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.129> 15<00:01:05.549> degrees<00:01:05.670> Celsius

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
it'll jump by about 15 degrees Celsius

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
it'll jump by about 15 degrees Celsius
next<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> add<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.880> indicator<00:01:09.450> Chris

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
next thing the add is an indicator Chris

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
next thing the add is an indicator Chris
all<00:01:10.080> red<00:01:10.460> crystal<00:01:11.460> red<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.119> red<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:13.320> orange

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
all red crystal red is red then orange

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.390 
all red crystal red is red then orange
then<00:01:13.950> yellow<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.909> pH<00:01:15.570> changes<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.250> we're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
then yellow as the pH changes so we're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
then yellow as the pH changes so we're
gonna<00:01:17.490> pour<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> bag<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.810> see

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
gonna pour it into the bag you can see

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
gonna pour it into the bag you can see
immediately<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.130> red<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.580> sort<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> an

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
immediately we go from red to sort of an

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
immediately we go from red to sort of an
apricot<00:01:21.299> color<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> last<00:01:23.040> thing

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
apricot color and then the last thing

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
apricot color and then the last thing
that<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> add<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.180> sodium<00:01:24.960> bicarbonate

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that you add is sodium bicarbonate

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.370 
that you add is sodium bicarbonate
regular<00:01:26.009> old<00:01:26.130> baking<00:01:26.460> soda<00:01:26.759> baking<00:01:27.720> soda<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
regular old baking soda baking soda is a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.730 
regular old baking soda baking soda is a
base<00:01:28.790> calcium<00:01:29.790> chloride<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.600> acid<00:01:31.140> when

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
base calcium chloride is an acid when

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
base calcium chloride is an acid when
you<00:01:31.860> mix<00:01:32.070> those<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.579> together<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:33.720> an

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you mix those two together there's an

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.469 
you mix those two together there's an
immediate<00:01:34.320> reaction<00:01:34.500> between<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
immediate reaction between the two you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
immediate reaction between the two you
seal<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> baggie<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.729> there's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
seal the baggie you can see that there's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
seal the baggie you can see that there's
a<00:01:38.970> ton<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> gas<00:01:39.600> released<00:01:40.200> rock<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
a ton of gas released rock it back and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
a ton of gas released rock it back and
forth<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> pH<00:01:44.090> changes<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> drops<00:01:45.509> way

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
forth and the pH changes it drops way

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
forth and the pH changes it drops way
down<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> carbon<00:01:47.040> dioxide

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
down because of all the carbon dioxide

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.330 
down because of all the carbon dioxide
the<00:01:48.390> gas<00:01:48.630> continues<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.470> evolve<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> bag

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the gas continues to evolve and the bag

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460 
the gas continues to evolve and the bag
gets<00:01:50.610> bigger<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> bigger<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> bigger<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
gets bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620 
gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> looks<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> pile

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
this is what it looks like with a pile

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.139 
this is what it looks like with a pile
