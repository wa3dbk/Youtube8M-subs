know about you guys but the one I got
was<00:02:52.680> not<00:02:52.950> where<00:02:53.130> Roman<00:02:53.489> died<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.880> anything<00:02:54.239> but

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
was not where Roman died or anything but

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.760 
was not where Roman died or anything but
it's<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> one<00:02:54.690> where<00:02:54.810> Rowan<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.350> turned<00:02:55.620> into

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's the one where Rowan was turned into

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.710 
it's the one where Rowan was turned into
a<00:02:55.890> roma<00:02:56.340> tomato<00:02:56.850> which<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.480> thought<00:02:57.600> was

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
a roma tomato which I thought was

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.180 
a roma tomato which I thought was
appropriate<00:02:57.870> because<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.709> his<00:02:58.860> name<00:02:59.010> is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
appropriate because you know his name is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
appropriate because you know his name is
Roman<00:02:59.550> after<00:02:59.820> also<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.270> roma<00:03:00.780> tomato<00:03:01.170> was

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
Roman after also a roma tomato was

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.710 
Roman after also a roma tomato was
perfect<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.760> know<00:03:02.880> Nika<00:03:03.239> went<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
perfect and you know Nika went on to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.330 
perfect and you know Nika went on to
carry<00:03:03.930> his<00:03:04.140> cousin<00:03:04.500> roaming<00:03:04.860> around<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.220> his
