00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.410
 hello the humidity the temperature and the 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.000
 luminosity are three factors 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.160
 fundamental for the development of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.619
 our plants and we will control them with 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.720
 a simple greenhouse greenhouses 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.439
 Solar radiation works by effect 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.699
 that when crossing a translucent material 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.560
 Warms the objects that are 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.259
 inside them which in turn 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 emit infrared radiation that is 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.099
 the one that produces the warming 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 we have built this greenhouse with 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.480
 pine jonquillos and we have fixed the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.340
 lid with a piano hinge the plants 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.949
 They are made of polycarbonate that we have sealed 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.930
 with silicone in something the same point cl 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.149
 You can find the pdf with the list of 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.290
 materials the measurements and the step by step 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.290
 to build this greenhouse 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.260
 The advantage of greenhouses is that 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.210
 allows to extend the sowing period 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.890
 our plants abroad as 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.420
 the plants are going to take full advantage 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.140
 sunlight 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.650
 It will also speed up the harvest 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.650
 so so so 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 when we sow species that require 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 the pollination of insects like these 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 Zapallitos is important that at the moment 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 to blossom let's open the stage of our 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.110
 greenhouse to allow the entry of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.110
 these insects 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 susan caves writes us because he 's 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 having serious bauza problems in his 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 garden and you want to know what product 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.830
 Can apply 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.229
 susan in the market there are many 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.479
 options you have organic products for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.820
 more stinging species and there are also 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 the modules you want the latter without 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.720
 However you must be very careful already 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 that if you have pets they can reach 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.070
 be toxic a more natural option is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.550
 cheating with yogurt containers and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.550
 beer 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.270
 remember that the environment closed and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.549
 condensed was to favor the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.229
 mushroom proliferation that's why 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.060
 besides ventilating it is important 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.800
 use an irrigation system that avoids 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.750
 moisture accumulation like watering 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.880
 by drip if you had any doubt 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 You can see this program again in Nago 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.630
 the same point cl where also 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.349
 You can share it with your friends in the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.280
 social networks 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.280
 ok, they're fine
