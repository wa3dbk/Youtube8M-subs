00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 really meanwhile everyone has everywhere 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 the school started but some the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.969
 you already at this dangerous and am 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.259
 There is one at the beginning of each school year 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.880
 few situations that you simply look at 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.470
 and could easily do without 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 that starts already in the first hours 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.740
 of the different subjects I am 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 now also in the upper level 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 So there are no classes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 more with me but only courses it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 so sit in each subject others 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 people around me and me because I 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 once failed which are guilty 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 I know so almost always in her two 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 people what actually from the beginning actually 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 but if you are a bit too 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 late come back to blame yourself 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 exactly these two people are sitting 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 side by side 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 Well, well are in synonymous in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.210
 stories first row just like math 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.680
 and bio and economics and in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 French probably further 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 the break and you know what it's called the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 Teacher does not explain anyone 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.340
 in front of a what where then the margin 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.180
 not known but everytime he does 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.039
 the blackboard writes in the first hour 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 so has all told one thing 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 what you can do what you need 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.920
 We all write clauses because you 're there 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 say that you do not have to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.869
 brand burger has no more and more 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.890
 you do not think and how should it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.570
 actually create 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 then it continues with the idea 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 but really if you are there 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.509
 really a complete round 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 I thought I 'm not half 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.340
 my fifth and then comes kalle 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.890

 my name is kahlo in the martin one 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.060
 part augsburger team and you consider 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.920
 know after about a week school 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.299
 then the books will not only be awarded 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.829
 that on the day all books after 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.600
 home drag must be no 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.579
 From then on, the school really starts 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 but do not like enough since this year 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.670
 my school is still one on the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.229
 Namely have the books for this 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.329
 school year already at the end of the last one 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.210

 can sleep 20 minutes longer 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.950
