smoke

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
smoke

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.320 
smoke
also<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.060> guys<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.540> used<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.380> olive<00:03:01.340> oil<00:03:01.550> because

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
also you guys I used a olive oil because

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.570 
also you guys I used a olive oil because
I<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.840> flavor<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.200> olive<00:03:03.620> oil<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:04.040> can

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
I like the flavor of olive oil you can

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.580 
I like the flavor of olive oil you can
choose<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.180> do<00:03:05.330> something<00:03:05.510> more<00:03:05.960> neutral<00:03:06.410> like

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
choose to do something more neutral like

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.190 
choose to do something more neutral like
doing<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.160> canola<00:03:07.670> or<00:03:07.970> peanut<00:03:08.450> oil<00:03:08.570> which<00:03:09.170> is

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
doing a canola or peanut oil which is

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.470 
doing a canola or peanut oil which is
more<00:03:09.560> typical<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.130> what<00:03:10.400> my<00:03:10.550> dad<00:03:10.580> would<00:03:11.180> use<00:03:11.330> in

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
more typical of what my dad would use in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
more typical of what my dad would use in
the<00:03:11.570> restaurant<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.050> more<00:03:12.350> typical<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.920> what

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
the restaurant and more typical of what

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.170 
the restaurant and more typical of what
you<00:03:13.070> would<00:03:13.160> find<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.730> Chinese<00:03:14.030> restaurant

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you would find in a Chinese restaurant

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.930 
you would find in a Chinese restaurant
so<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> think<00:03:14.960> it's<00:03:15.260> time<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:16.130> see<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:16.460> happens

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
so I think it's time to see what happens

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.160 
so I think it's time to see what happens
here's<00:03:17.450> where<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.660> magic<00:03:17.990> happens

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.530
