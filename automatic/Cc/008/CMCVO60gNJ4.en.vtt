00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.750
 cassava countries today I will explain how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.750
 the instagram application works 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.380
 instagram is a social network of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.270
 Photographs in which users 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 You can take pictures with your phone 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.300
 mobile edit them and share them we can 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.520
 create a profile on this icon here 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.559
 in which the pictures that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.020
 we have published so far the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.330
 photographs can be taken in the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.489
 precise moment when we open the 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.050
 application or we can select them 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.050
 From our gallery 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.130
 in this case I already have one prepared 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 what is it is here and we select the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.620
 part that we want to choose from the photo 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.980
 and once we select it we can 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.380
 choose between the filter gallery 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.690
 the one that we like most for example we can 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.040
 make a black and white photo that I'm going 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.040
 to choose the loft ay 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.510
 we can edit 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.400
 to see or stop seeing the sea 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.050
 each filter has its own white 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.570
 personalized 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.490
 if you choose this for example I would have 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 this frame here in white 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.090
 we can also add the effect of 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 larger or smaller club which 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 we can edit using both fingers 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.280
 and the contrast 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.160
 once we finish we can add a 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.160
 description 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.470
 tag people and add the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.500
 photography to the photo map also 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.390
 We can share it on facebook twitter 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.390
 tumblr foursquare or flickr 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 as you see once the photo is finished 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.120
 appears on the front page and in our 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.830
 profile we can also use nothing in 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.870
 the photographs that we create with 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.080
 instagram to put it as photo of 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.080
 profile 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.040

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.099

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.420
 trend have at this time in 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.430
 instagram 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.960
 also instagram now implement a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.960
 feature that allows videos to be made 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.900
 we can also synchronize our 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.110
 followers via facebook to have a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.330
 our friends and do searches by 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.330
 example by users or labels 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.560

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.330
