00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
basically gonna soften and smooth out

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.720 
basically gonna soften and smooth out
any<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.320> those<00:03:34.470> little<00:03:34.680> flyaways<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> back

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
any of those little flyaways in the back

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.880 
any of those little flyaways in the back
and<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.180> also<00:03:36.420> helps<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.049> maintain<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.590> style

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and this also helps to maintain my style

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.949 
and this also helps to maintain my style
throughout<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> day<00:03:38.519> if<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.209> sweat<00:03:39.750> or

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
throughout the day if I sweat or

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.660 
throughout the day if I sweat or
anything<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:41.070> hair<00:03:41.250> doesn't<00:03:41.370> curl

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
anything like that my hair doesn't curl

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.320 
anything like that my hair doesn't curl
back<00:03:41.850> up<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:42.930> natural<00:03:43.650> so

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
back up because it's it's natural so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.210

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
sometimes I get it perfect and sometimes

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.550 
sometimes I get it perfect and sometimes
it's<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.700> fight<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.450> think<00:03:48.660> today<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.230> wasn't

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560
