00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.790
 This video here came from a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.010
 I saw some videos here I decided 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.929
 commented on nothing more and nothing less 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 coincidentally, steel has to do with 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.770
 Last talk Maromba that I recorded Saturday 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 has to do with the next video I'm going to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 also launch throughout the week 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.609
 I 'm not even copying up 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 What I came here to talk about is because I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 I was amazed and decided to talk about a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 turn 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 you saw this discussion all over the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 sardine made a video after the coast 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 posted an answer rolled a post in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.540
 some legal forum 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.250
 I saw the video of the two today I wanted 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.920
 comment very simple thing today that the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 sardine read refuted is not wrong to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
 issue is that the site played poxa of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 one way through and roni 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.579
 Then he Brazil, his entire video 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.980
 all those examples of him in someone 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.340
 who simply do not understand anything about 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 diet you are looking for hypertrophy will take 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 two fucking glass of milk before 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 Sleep will have a glass of milk. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 skimmed when waking up only one animal 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.610
 same 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 he exemplified soy protein 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.920
 lentils and ground beef 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 but who understands the least knows which 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 are the good foods to have as 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 source of protein any marombeiro of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.549
 backyard knows that business is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 inside grilled chicken is the stew 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.680
 grilled rump the adilson spoke 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.509
 Truths the whole video 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 but who did that push that he 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.820
 mentioned it is not a chicken that like 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.070
 That ridiculous diet that I told them all day. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 That diet is more or less what I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.579
 I'll pass on to a woman wanting 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.729
 slimming with low lean mass loss 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.640
 As for the video of the lito it shows 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 much more cohesive and I agree with everything 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.750
 what does he speak 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 I later enjoyed watching a video 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 about we intend to adin and I agree with 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.469
 He's disagreeing again because to him. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.540
 or me living with it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.240
 It's easy to say business is training. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 from the heart to the common people 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.710
 normalize the same as it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 exemplified in the value video 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.210
 biological guy drinking a glass of milk 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.820
 as a meal 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.070
 Then you'll be discouraged by the same training. 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.670
 normal or personal trainer 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.010
 who trains only at certain times of the year 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.820
 so there's nothing wrong with that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.100
 not 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.170
 and for all of them the pre workout can 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.930
 be very useful rather as a motivator 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.480
 as a stimulant that is what is in the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.310
 true and before anyone and thinks 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 in some thing you know I already said 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.900
 adin fields in several videos including 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.630
 given that I interviewed a liter we 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.910
 two students played the guy I do not know 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.880
 if it was the same or someone commented the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.310
 my video that the e-mail that meat 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.230
 sign did an exercise similar to this. 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.410
 voter of what he did today seems like a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.820
 comment was the following was commented 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.670
 yesterday the sign 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.480
 I need 200 grams of protein per 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.030
 day 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 let's assume that all six thousand 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.330
 two hundred and thirty-seven grams of meat 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.650
 is absorbed 100% which does not exist anymore 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.440
 just to facilitate 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.090
 I would need to eat almost a pound of 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.250
 meat per day 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 and it looks like I considered 100% absorption 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.280
 How do I eat a kilo of meat? 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.650
 day 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.930
 diet has to be diversified and the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.810
 serves as a facilitator who 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.160
 many a need has very well 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.740
 cheaper 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.820
 this comment was posted by channel 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.450
 sardine in my video again the same 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.250
 mistake that I quoted he does not know 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.310
 relativize things 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.630
 I think if it is explained by the fact 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.110
 he is a person with a lot of 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.090
 knowledge is based on science and I 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.530
 I see this all the time in college. 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.830
 time no one tries to understand 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.230
 better than the other one means only looking 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.380
 the mistakes to keep talking badly without having 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.100
 tried to understand anything in relativizing 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.950
 Did I mention some time in the video? 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.470
 To only eat meat all day, I 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.230
 I said that every dietary protein would have 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.960
 to come from meat not I told 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.950
 replace the 25 grams of 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.580
 dose 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.910
 dawei by charge only that is what it is 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.380
 much business will be replacing 25 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.080
 for more than 30 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.750
 the rest of the diet would be maintained 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.810
 contact according to what I said 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.900
 that is, the supervalued arguments of 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.120
 who said that it is right but in a 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.140
 ideal situation he invented for 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.000
 be certain and it is clear and obvious that 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.860
 there is the cheapest ex the same way 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.610
 that there are much cheaper cars than 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.910
 to taste 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.740
 the same way the best egg 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.240
 cost-effectively undeniably who is it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.470
 will say the opposite has neither what 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.510
 to discuss 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.380
 I honestly do not understand why. 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.240
 all to 1 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.650
 it seems that the adin think that everyone is 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.930
 bodybuilder 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.200
 It is clear that jay takes 20 doses of and per 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.290
 day that she weighs 120 pounds in kick of 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.630
 Trombolone testosterone 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.400
 whole year 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.330
 then there is a hint for the next 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.520
 videos - adi you're myth and almost everything 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.840
 world here in brazil discusses me a lot 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.150
 I'm one of them 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.120
 but start to use things more 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.640
 instead of inventing situations to say 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.550
 that you're right or even record your 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.510
 reality for all of us who are paltry 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.510
 human beings
