alone get a lot of reps to improve my

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
alone get a lot of reps to improve my
game<00:00:54.210> known<00:00:54.840> today<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> come<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
game known today that I can come out and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.380 
game known today that I can come out and
work<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.340> things<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.940> didn't<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.270> well

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
work on things that I didn't do well

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900 
work on things that I didn't do well
yesterday<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.960> doing<00:00:58.140> better<00:00:58.289> today<00:00:58.910> that's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
yesterday and doing better today that's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
yesterday and doing better today that's
different<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.170> approach<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
different and so my approach can be a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770 
different and so my approach can be a
little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.949> different<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.780> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
little bit different that way but it's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380 
little bit different that way but it's
pretty<00:01:04.739> much<00:01:04.860> same<00:01:05.129> old<00:01:05.280> same<00:01:05.430> old<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pretty much same old same old do you

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.700 
pretty much same old same old do you
feel<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> different<00:01:07.500> position

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
feel like you're in a different position

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
feel like you're in a different position
of<00:01:08.040> leadership<00:01:08.310> coming<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> year's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
of leadership coming into this year's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.200 
of leadership coming into this year's

going down to Atlanta I don't know and
in<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.430> end<00:06:46.580> of<00:06:46.700> a<00:06:46.820> good<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.450> imagine<00:06:47.900> this<00:06:47.960> kind

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
in the end of a good I imagine this kind

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.550 
in the end of a good I imagine this kind
of<00:06:48.230> fatty<00:06:48.920> fried<00:06:49.190> we<00:06:50.030> can<00:06:50.510> depend<00:06:50.990> south<00:06:51.380> of

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
of fatty fried we can depend south of

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.680 
of fatty fried we can depend south of
i-70<00:06:52.040> totally<00:06:52.670> different<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.000> north<00:06:53.150> of<00:06:53.240> i-70

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
i-70 totally different the north of i-70

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.780 
i-70 totally different the north of i-70
so<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.020> good<00:06:54.170> Eaton's<00:06:54.440> south<00:06:54.830> of<00:06:54.950> i-70<00:06:55.370> was

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
so the good Eaton's south of i-70 was

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.070 
so the good Eaton's south of i-70 was
that<00:06:56.000> we're<00:06:56.150> self<00:06:56.420> bad<00:06:56.600> i<00:06:56.630> don't<00:06:56.870> even<00:06:56.960> know
