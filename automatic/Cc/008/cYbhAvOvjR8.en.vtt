00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
once again when was the last time when I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.410 
once again when was the last time when I
started<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> after-show<00:00:19.220> 3.0<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> pre

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
started the after-show 3.0 this is a pre

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.349 
started the after-show 3.0 this is a pre
CC<00:00:21.750> engine<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.710> sometimes<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:24.060> bit

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
CC engine and it's sometimes a bit

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
CC engine and it's sometimes a bit
tricky<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.930> keep<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.350> running<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.220> tuning

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
tricky to keep it running but the tuning

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
tricky to keep it running but the tuning
the<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.269> tuning<00:00:27.689> will<00:00:27.840> keep<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.230> running

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the right tuning will keep it running

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.890 
the right tuning will keep it running
and<00:00:28.820> again<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.179> been<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.750> really

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and again this has been a really really

and again this has been a really really
really<00:00:31.170> long<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.529> since<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.130> last<00:00:32.399> started

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
