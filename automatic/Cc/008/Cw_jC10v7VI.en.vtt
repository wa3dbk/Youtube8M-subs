00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.790
 some used it is pretty cool 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.850
 and there people are much more green and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.920
 driver commented and who speaks is the team 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.430
 This time it's another episode in our 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.290
 series on the throne beach pro 4 then go there 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 This is a mission that I bring to you. 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.060
 says napier and I'm going to say some things 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.740
 about what's going on here in 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.900
 issue of shooting 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.449
 the issue is more positioning and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.460
 behavior during the mission and have a 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.310
 more passive behavior expects the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 enemy to come and take action 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 You saw that I prepared the ground 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.240
 left an escape route if anyone 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.600
 Advance me because I do not like it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.960
 I have the habit of facing enemies. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.450
 the short distance there are people who 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.640
 quite easily is one thing that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
 I'll try to improve with time. 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.720
 also 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.040
 so if you can kill short 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.440
 distance you already have a security 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.330
 huge at that first moment the wait 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.390
 was great because the enemy had 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.179
 Exchanged item smo I had tried 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.990
 to defend only that everyone was dying 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.360
 it was no use for the team to move there and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.200
 try to help then what simply 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.539
 waiting for them to arrive and yes 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 able to start playing at this stage. 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.890
 in the early stages of this mission to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 people lost very fast we did not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.440
 he was able to defend and only then 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.479
 we had a greater resistance here 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.580
 We arrived until one minute and one 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.260
 bit of resistance but they 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.000
 ended up doing 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.730
 I do not usually do much with it . 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.210
 but I can hit both shots 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.420
 followed but there has to be enough 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.610
 roof 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
 if not what tells the enemy sting it 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.430
 can overcome he can not he will 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.230
 overcome your team that I then you have 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.720
 to be aware of this hit a shot 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.700
 if he covers the face again, yes 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.740
 You'll get the elimination I 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.709
 chance one rifle had another when the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.980
 enemy or advance but in most 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.660
 The time I go to support it is really mine. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 expensive then make a fastfood 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220
 a person already threatened because there I already 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.670
 I'm helping my team do the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.470
 goal or try to defend the problem is 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.010
 that when you are defending and have 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.860
 few people in the area of â€‹â€‹the complicated objective 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.380
 more your in taiwan a goal by 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.960
 A lot of time is sure to go. 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.090
 catch the problem if I had 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.160
 As a technique, something that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.130
 If I were mobile I could be 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.580
 even forward most advanced such 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.770
 to defend with certainty because the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.010
 and we were not moving forward like this. 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.410
 totally together he is a Portuguese and 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.130
 It was quite easy for you to get a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.990
 elimination with enitec weapons of the type outside 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.560
 I was calm, no one was there. 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.290
 focusing wholeheartedly until one of them 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.990
 tries to move forward and achieve elimination 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.970
 I ended up dying and one day I die in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.750
 then they get a tv quiz that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.460
 so fast and objective is done here 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.709
 I think it 's because a lot of time in this 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.630
 local to and alone right 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.940
 there was no one to defend me in the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.090
 because if there was someone there together 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.870
 me and could even try to eliminate 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.150
 who came to kill me then the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.330
 you had with the team would 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.430
 easier for me to survive but the location 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.380
 It was so good, it was giving so much 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.620
 of what the enemy was trying to do 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.590
 which I decided not to change then an hour 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.900
 or another was going to end this I can 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.910
 elimination of a face but need 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.190
 to get in the same car kind if I 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.410
 had hit the first shot he 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.350
 would enter the car the same way 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.880
 The team is on the side of our team. 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.620
 very complicated we could not 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.110
 make no point 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 someone who pulled 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.340
 was objective 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.490
 Another problem is also who is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.830
 facing the 312 of our team 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.280
 the other two expected to arrive then 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.669
 arrived late and did not give us time 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.260
 get focus even goal 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.700
 as much as I have achieved these 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.890
 two eliminations 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.080
 I could not even pick up a suitcase. 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.689
 because there already had one and I answered it 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.879
 was there 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.979
 behind the place that we had to 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.259
 to pack the enemy was 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.499
 waiting then it was something mean 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.509
 suspect then did not want to risk taking 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:14.139
 bag and was waiting for the team. 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.539
 only the team took too long and it was in that 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.059
 moment that the three will join made 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.309
 objective without any objection could not 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.289
 doing nothing fits the coin and also that 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:26.679
 I was in the 3 x 1 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.139
 If it had come, people arrive as well. 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:32.409
 the faster you would leave that 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.209
 briefcase he and maybe dro talk once in a while 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.059
 when it happens the very same ally 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:40.329
 that he is like entec or else you are mg 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:43.300
 ball the staff and forward and do not see 

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:45.819
 that the inep is trying to cover so that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.699
 he made a goal so stick 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.709
 nobody did anything and that's what gave 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.019
 opening for another team to achieve 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.089
 points to win this mission if 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.459
 had changed the weapon that was a 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:00.309
 It's kind of obvious, right? 

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:02.589
 I would change my weapon and move forward. 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:05.409
 make goal try to get the suitcase 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:10.360
 at least but I wanted to play only from 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:12.849
 sniper then to this problem that ended 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.919
 in the end we can not win the 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.619
 game at the very end we can 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.899
 clean their base but then it was late 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:22.239
 too much for us to get over 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:25.059
 time and even if you can move 

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:27.309
 would be extremely difficult to defend 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:29.679
 because it's just another team 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.329
 Ruscha 3 closing to try to catch a 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:34.149
 letter would be like this 

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:34.989
 It's a complicated thing even if 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:36.309
 defend 

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:39.639
 Guys, I hope you liked it. 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:41.319
 or make the new prolik more 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.479
 frequent and that's it 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:46.179
 If you liked this, your favorite lycee. 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:49.139
 to help in the dissemination and even more 

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.139
 say hi
