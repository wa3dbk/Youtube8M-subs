00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
decided it was it I actually didn't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.380 
decided it was it I actually didn't
think<00:00:30.689> I'd<00:00:30.779> ever<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.199> YouTube<00:00:31.710> full<00:00:31.949> time<00:00:32.390> but

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
think I'd ever do YouTube full time but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
think I'd ever do YouTube full time but
then<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.170> started<00:00:34.680> getting<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:35.100> views

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
then I just started getting more views

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
then I just started getting more views
and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.570> signed<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> network<00:00:37.559> are

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and then I signed with the network are

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
and then I signed with the network are
saying<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.100> Sarah<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.790> time<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> was

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
saying with Sarah with a time it was

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
saying with Sarah with a time it was
cloud<00:00:39.690> media<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.620> big<00:00:40.800> frame<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
cloud media now it's big frame and I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
cloud media now it's big frame and I
think<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.960> collaborations<00:00:43.710> were

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
think at that time collaborations were

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
think at that time collaborations were
huge<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:44.670> feel<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.940> there's<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> same

huge I don't feel like there's the same

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
huge I don't feel like there's the same
