I've been to Japan and danica pursuits

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.100 
I've been to Japan and danica pursuits
over<00:00:16.490> there<00:00:16.670> with<00:00:16.850> an<00:00:16.940> actress<00:00:17.270> doing<00:00:17.960> some

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
over there with an actress doing some

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.920 
over there with an actress doing some
time<00:00:18.350> lapse<00:00:18.590> work<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:19.880> served<00:00:20.300> me<00:00:20.420> really

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
time lapse work and it served me really

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.859 
time lapse work and it served me really
well<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:21.230> actually<00:00:21.619> been<00:00:21.800> relatively

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
well it's actually been relatively

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.720 
well it's actually been relatively
compact<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:24.529> know<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:24.890> as<00:00:25.189> big<00:00:25.460> as<00:00:25.580> it<00:00:25.699> is

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
compact you know it's as big as it is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.109 
compact you know it's as big as it is
and<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:27.170> has<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> number<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.949> nice<00:00:28.759> little

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
and it has a number of nice little

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.150 
and it has a number of nice little
features<00:00:29.449> which<00:00:29.660> think<00:00:30.439> probably<00:00:31.009> most

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
features which think probably most

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.070 
features which think probably most
people<00:00:31.369> find<00:00:31.640> quite<00:00:31.789> useful<00:00:32.210> for<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.780> start

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
people find quite useful for a start

it's a video light it's got a variable
amount<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.820> power<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:38.210> can<00:00:38.360> put<00:00:38.450> into<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:38.660> so

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
amount of power you can put into it so

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.389 
amount of power you can put into it so
you<00:00:39.290> can<00:00:39.469> turn<00:00:39.649> up<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:39.950> can<00:00:40.070> turn<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.219> down

flick down to double-a as well you can
also<00:01:12.250> click<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.370> up<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.640> charge<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.300> that's

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
also click it up to charge and that's

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.970 
also click it up to charge and that's
really<00:01:14.810> nice<00:01:14.930> if<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.290> have<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.650> full<00:01:15.920> of

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
really nice if you have this full of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.250 
really nice if you have this full of
batteries<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:17.270> can<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.480> six<00:01:17.780> batteries<00:01:18.110> in

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
batteries you can have six batteries in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.210 
batteries you can have six batteries in
there<00:01:18.380> perhaps<00:01:18.530> six<00:01:18.890> double<00:01:19.130> A<00:01:19.190> batteries

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
there perhaps six double A batteries

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.370 
there perhaps six double A batteries
that's<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.300> lot<00:01:20.540> of<00:01:20.600> batteries<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.050> put<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.290> a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
that's a lot of batteries to put into a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.020 
that's a lot of batteries to put into a
charger<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.400> nice<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.730> they've

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
charger so it's nice that they've

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.820 
charger so it's nice that they've
actually<00:01:23.210> made<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.690> into<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.350> charger

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
actually made this into a charger

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.970 
actually made this into a charger
charges<00:01:25.820> by<00:01:25.970> way<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.180> mini<00:01:27.050> USB<00:01:27.230> just<00:01:27.620> there

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
charges by way of mini USB just there

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.920 
charges by way of mini USB just there
which<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.610> really<00:01:29.120> useful<00:01:29.330> because<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.750> means

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
which is really useful because it means

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.750 
which is really useful because it means
you<00:01:29.990> can<00:01:30.170> charge<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:30.470> computer<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.460> charge

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
you can charge your computer you charge

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.680 
you can charge your computer you charge
it<00:01:31.820> from<00:01:32.150> potentially<00:01:32.930> an<00:01:33.050> ipod<00:01:33.710> /<00:01:34.070> ipad<00:01:34.690> wall

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.320 
it from potentially an ipod / ipad wall
socket<00:01:36.110> anything<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.370> USB<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.090> all

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
socket anything like that and USB is all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.760 
socket anything like that and USB is all
over<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.690> place<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:38.960> quite<00:01:39.170> quick<00:01:39.410> and<00:01:39.560> easy

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
over the place is quite quick and easy

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.350 
over the place is quite quick and easy
to<00:01:39.980> charge<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.370> means<00:01:40.910> you<00:01:41.000> don't<00:01:41.150> have<00:01:41.210> to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
to charge this means you don't have to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.750 
to charge this means you don't have to
carry<00:01:41.570> around<00:01:41.630> another<00:01:42.140> adapter<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.400> to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
carry around another adapter with you to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.240 
carry around another adapter with you to
actually<00:01:44.150> plug<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.140> charge<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.680> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
actually plug it in to charge it and it

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.380 
actually plug it in to charge it and it
means<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.670> can<00:01:46.790> keep<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.000> batteries<00:01:47.270> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
means that you can keep the batteries in

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.460 
means that you can keep the batteries in
there<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.660> it<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.870> all<00:01:47.990> keeps<00:01:48.230> everything

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
there and it just all keeps everything

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.780 
there and it just all keeps everything
meeting<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:48.980> one<00:01:49.100> place<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.490> you're<00:01:49.640> less

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
meeting in one place and you're less

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.090 
meeting in one place and you're less
likely<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.230> go<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.410> shoot<00:01:51.680> without<00:01:51.860> your

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
likely to go to a shoot without your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.640 
likely to go to a shoot without your
batteries<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.300> video<00:01:53.780> light<00:01:53.960> that's<00:01:54.440> nice

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
batteries in the video light that's nice

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.250 
batteries in the video light that's nice
like<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.210> also<00:01:56.210> we've<00:01:56.510> got<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.840> load<00:01:57.110> of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
like that also we've got a load of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.990 
like that also we've got a load of
different<00:01:57.650> mounting<00:01:58.160> points<00:01:58.490> around<00:01:58.760> here

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
different mounting points around here

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.610 
different mounting points around here
now<00:01:59.120> this<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.330> quite<00:01:59.510> interesting<00:01:59.570> at<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
now this is quite interesting at the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.610 
now this is quite interesting at the
bottom<00:02:00.770> we've<00:02:01.040> got<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.600> little<00:02:02.600> screw<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.470> you

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
bottom we've got a little screw that you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.130 
bottom we've got a little screw that you
can<00:02:03.740> actually<00:02:03.920> undo<00:02:04.340> now<00:02:05.120> this<00:02:05.300> would<00:02:05.570> be<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
can actually undo now this would be the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.219 
can actually undo now this would be the
bit<00:02:06.770> which<00:02:06.860> connects<00:02:07.160> on<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> actual<00:02:08.300> shoe

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
bit which connects on to the actual shoe

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
bit which connects on to the actual shoe
on<00:02:09.349> top<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.679> your<00:02:09.830> video<00:02:10.550> camera<00:02:10.850> or<00:02:10.930> normal

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
on top of your video camera or normal

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.320 
on top of your video camera or normal
camera<00:02:12.130> photo<00:02:13.130> camera<00:02:13.430> now<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.120> can

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
camera photo camera now that can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.850 
camera photo camera now that can
actually<00:02:14.540> be<00:02:14.870> mounted<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
actually be mounted on the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.500 
actually be mounted on the
just<00:02:16.100> here<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.240> standing<00:02:17.360> up

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
just here so you can have it standing up

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.060 
just here so you can have it standing up
that<00:02:17.660> way<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.410> handle<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.650> side<00:02:18.860> just

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
that way you can handle that side just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.090 
that way you can handle that side just
there<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:19.970> out<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.270> side<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.450> there

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
there you can out on the side just there

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.070 
there you can out on the side just there
even<00:02:22.100> more<00:02:22.130> interesting<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.930> can

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
even more interesting in that you can

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.370 
even more interesting in that you can
actually<00:02:24.320> get<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:26.270> other<00:02:26.630> smaller

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
actually get this and the other smaller

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.380 
actually get this and the other smaller
video<00:02:27.620> light<00:02:27.770> or<00:02:27.980> even<00:02:28.190> two<00:02:28.580> three<00:02:29.000> four<00:02:29.300> of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
video light or even two three four of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.300 
video light or even two three four of
these<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.840> join<00:02:30.530> them<00:02:30.680> together<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.160> can

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
these and join them together so you can

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.030 
these and join them together so you can
actually<00:02:31.520> create<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.150> bigger<00:02:32.450> panel<00:02:32.990> by<00:02:33.710> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
actually create a bigger panel by just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.370 
actually create a bigger panel by just
using<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.360> connector<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.050> we've<00:02:36.170> got<00:02:36.320> on

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
using the connector that we've got on

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.320 
using the connector that we've got on
the<00:02:36.440> bottom<00:02:36.710> there<00:02:36.860> sliding<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.180> another

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the bottom there sliding on to another

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.810 
the bottom there sliding on to another
video<00:02:38.540> light<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.050> then<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.680> got<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.130> double<00:02:40.430> or

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
video light and then you got a double or

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.730 
video light and then you got a double or
triple<00:02:41.000> or<00:02:41.210> quadruple<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.750> amount<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:42.140> power

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
triple or quadruple the amount of power

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.320 
triple or quadruple the amount of power
going<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.459> subject<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:44.030> whatever<00:02:44.270> you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
going on to your subject or whatever you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.170 
going on to your subject or whatever you
want<00:02:44.830> also<00:02:45.830> we've<00:02:46.070> got<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.790> tripod

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
want also we've got a lot of tripod

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.940 
want also we've got a lot of tripod
mount<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.480> bottom<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:47.870> there<00:02:48.050> which

can<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:52.190> attach<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.760> gorillapod<00:02:53.090> onto<00:02:53.300> this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
can just attach the gorillapod onto this

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.030 
can just attach the gorillapod onto this
and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:54.080> clamp<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.500> light<00:02:54.620> where<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040

fantastic<00:03:04.480> apart<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:06.170> a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
fantastic apart from that it's a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.900 
fantastic apart from that it's a
relatively<00:03:06.920> straightforward<00:03:07.459> an<00:03:07.550> operation

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
relatively straightforward an operation

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.340 
relatively straightforward an operation
like<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.120> say<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.600> turn<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.870> on<00:03:08.930> click<00:03:09.260> the

like I say you just turn it on click the
buttons<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.310> back<00:03:10.820> opens<00:03:11.300> up<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.780> reveal

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
buttons the back opens up to reveal

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.910 
buttons the back opens up to reveal
shock<00:03:12.739> horror<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.880> battery<00:03:14.540> compartment<00:03:15.050> can

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
shock horror a battery compartment can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.150 
shock horror a battery compartment can
do<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.220> remove<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> anchors<00:03:17.600> mark<00:03:17.980> yep<00:03:18.980> so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
do it remove the anchors mark yep so

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.620 
do it remove the anchors mark yep so
that's<00:03:19.310> where<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.520> batteries<00:03:19.760> go<00:03:19.820> no

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.130 
that's where the batteries go no
surprises<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.910> actual<00:03:23.510> light<00:03:23.810> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
surprises there the actual light that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.900 
surprises there the actual light that
comes<00:03:24.260> out<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.310> about<00:03:25.400> five

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
comes out of this is at about five

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.420 
comes out of this is at about five
thousand<00:03:26.690> five<00:03:26.930> hundred<00:03:26.959> Kelvin<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.100> then

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
thousand five hundred Kelvin and then

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.820 
thousand five hundred Kelvin and then
that<00:03:28.910> will<00:03:29.030> mix<00:03:29.330> relatively<00:03:30.260> nicely<00:03:30.680> with

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
that will mix relatively nicely with

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.789 
that will mix relatively nicely with
daylight<00:03:31.640> balanced<00:03:32.180> fluorescent<00:03:32.780> light<00:03:32.930> I've

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
daylight balanced fluorescent light I've

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.380 
daylight balanced fluorescent light I've
been<00:03:33.920> doing<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.160> quite<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.430> lot<00:03:34.489> just<00:03:34.880> within

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
been doing that quite a lot just within

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.960 
been doing that quite a lot just within
sword<00:03:35.750> studio<00:03:36.080> situation<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.799> if<00:03:37.790> you're

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
sword studio situation and if you're

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.110 
sword studio situation and if you're
outside<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:39.250> while<00:03:40.250> you're<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.730> daylight<00:03:41.090> but

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
outside and while you're in daylight but

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.550 
outside and while you're in daylight but
not<00:03:41.570> direct<00:03:41.989> daylight<00:03:42.290> because<00:03:42.350> it's

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
not direct daylight because it's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.690 
not direct daylight because it's
probably<00:03:42.920> won't<00:03:43.070> compete<00:03:43.340> with<00:03:43.489> direct

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
probably won't compete with direct

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.830 
probably won't compete with direct
daylight<00:03:44.000> unless<00:03:44.120> you're<00:03:44.269> right<00:03:44.570> up<00:03:44.660> against

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.590 
daylight unless you're right up against
on<00:03:44.930> my<00:03:45.019> face<00:03:45.260> but<00:03:45.920> if<00:03:46.010> you're<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.400> say<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:47.090> shade

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
on my face but if you're in say a shade

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.880 
on my face but if you're in say a shade
shadow<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:48.350> wanted<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.620> cast<00:03:48.769> a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
shadow and you just wanted to cast a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.500 
shadow and you just wanted to cast a
little<00:03:48.950> bit<00:03:49.130> more<00:03:49.250> light<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.790> this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
little bit more light and so on this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.000 
little bit more light and so on this
would<00:03:50.660> probably<00:03:50.900> makes<00:03:51.350> quite<00:03:51.560> well<00:03:51.799> with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
would probably makes quite well with

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.160 
would probably makes quite well with
daylight<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:53.000> wouldn't<00:03:53.299> have<00:03:53.840> an<00:03:53.930> orange

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
daylight it wouldn't have an orange

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.990 
daylight it wouldn't have an orange
carts<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.709> like<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:55.070> normal<00:03:55.519> incandescent

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
carts to it like a normal incandescent

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.979 
carts to it like a normal incandescent
light<00:03:56.510> or<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.870> normal<00:03:58.330> home<00:03:59.330> balanced

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
light or a normal home balanced

light or a normal home balanced
fluorescent<00:04:01.299> energy-saving<00:04:02.299> light<00:04:02.450> wood

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
fluorescent energy-saving light wood

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.530 
fluorescent energy-saving light wood
that's<00:04:04.190> pretty<00:04:04.370> much<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.580> I'll<00:04:04.940> cutting<00:04:05.360> some

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
that's pretty much it I'll cutting some

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.330 
that's pretty much it I'll cutting some
test<00:04:05.750> footage<00:04:05.840> here<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.560> like<00:04:06.980> i<00:04:07.070> said<00:04:07.130> i've

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
test footage here and like i said i've

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.490 
test footage here and like i said i've
been<00:04:07.459> using<00:04:07.580> this<00:04:07.760> on<00:04:07.970> timeless<00:04:08.930> photography

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
been using this on timeless photography

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.160 
been using this on timeless photography
as<00:04:09.680> well<00:04:09.739> as<00:04:10.610> video<00:04:11.030> work<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.900> idea<00:04:12.110> with

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
as well as video work the idea with

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.500 
as well as video work the idea with
time-lapse<00:04:12.590> photography<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.760> if<00:04:14.000> we

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
time-lapse photography was that if we

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.150 
time-lapse photography was that if we
used<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.900> flash<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.500> situation<00:04:15.799> you'll

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
used a flash in that situation you'll

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.670 
used a flash in that situation you'll
see<00:04:16.250> what<00:04:16.370> i<00:04:16.400> mean<00:04:16.430> your<00:04:16.940> video<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.419> flash<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.410> a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
see what i mean your video a flash in a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.380 
see what i mean your video a flash in a
public<00:04:18.979> place<00:04:19.070> that's<00:04:19.790> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> be<00:04:20.090> repeated

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
public place that's going to be repeated

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.680 
public place that's going to be repeated
i<00:04:20.810> think<00:04:21.350> most<00:04:21.620> those<00:04:21.890> sequences<00:04:22.610> have<00:04:22.820> 300

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
i think most those sequences have 300

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.740 
i think most those sequences have 300
shots<00:04:23.990> at<00:04:24.260> least<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.280> having<00:04:25.580> 300<00:04:25.970> flashes

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
shots at least so you having 300 flashes

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.690 
shots at least so you having 300 flashes
in<00:04:26.900> quick<00:04:27.110> succession

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
in quick succession

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.670 
in quick succession
it's<00:04:28.660> going<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.810> be<00:04:28.930> incredibly<00:04:29.290> bright<00:04:29.500> it's

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
it's going to be incredibly bright it's

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.050 
it's going to be incredibly bright it's
going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:29.920> incredibly<00:04:30.460> distracting<00:04:31.000> is

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
going to be incredibly distracting is

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.400 
going to be incredibly distracting is
going<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.270> draw<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.420> lot<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.810> attention<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.320> you

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
going to draw a lot of attention to you

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.490 
going to draw a lot of attention to you
so<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.340> opted<00:04:33.610> for<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.240> concert<00:04:35.020> video<00:04:35.290> light

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
so we opted for a concert video light

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.190 
so we opted for a concert video light
and<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.640> was<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:37.060> lot<00:04:37.480> more<00:04:37.510> discreet<00:04:37.960> it's

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
and that was a lot more discreet it's

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.590 
and that was a lot more discreet it's
just<00:04:38.440> one<00:04:38.650> light<00:04:38.890> shining<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:40.120> too<00:04:40.360> bright

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
just one light shining not too bright

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.450 
just one light shining not too bright
and<00:04:40.900> it's<00:04:41.320> not<00:04:41.440> constantly<00:04:41.800> flashing<00:04:41.980> on<00:04:42.250> not

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
and it's not constantly flashing on not

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.310 
and it's not constantly flashing on not
certainly<00:04:43.180> for<00:04:43.330> one<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.810> shots<00:04:43.960> where<00:04:44.200> we

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
certainly for one of the shots where we

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.660 
certainly for one of the shots where we
were<00:04:44.470> actually<00:04:44.710> on<00:04:44.920> a<00:04:44.980> road<00:04:45.250> we<00:04:45.490> would<00:04:45.580> have

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
were actually on a road we would have

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.340 
were actually on a road we would have
just<00:04:45.790> been<00:04:45.910> moved<00:04:46.120> on<00:04:46.240> immediately<00:04:46.960> if<00:04:47.110> we<00:04:47.200> had

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
just been moved on immediately if we had

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.110 
just been moved on immediately if we had
a<00:04:47.380> flash<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:48.190> as<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.430> was<00:04:48.520> no<00:04:48.820> I'm<00:04:48.880> really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
a flash but as it was no I'm really

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.060 
a flash but as it was no I'm really
complained<00:04:49.510> now<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> couple<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.590> accessories

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
complained now a couple of accessories

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.110 
complained now a couple of accessories
that<00:04:51.220> come<00:04:51.370> with<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.820> should<00:04:52.000> probably

that come with this I should probably
