00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it useful this is a review of the Walton

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.080 
it useful this is a review of the Walton
CDI<00:00:18.230> gmt<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.470> Walton<00:00:20.039> has<00:00:20.699> an<00:00:20.850> interesting

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
CDI gmt so Walton has an interesting

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.179 
CDI gmt so Walton has an interesting
modern<00:00:21.779> history<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.439> guess<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> could<00:00:22.920> say

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
modern history I guess you could say

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.210 
modern history I guess you could say
that<00:00:23.330> it's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.510> traditionally<00:00:25.289> American<00:00:25.949> brand

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that it's a traditionally American brand

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
that it's a traditionally American brand
so<00:00:26.519> you've<00:00:27.300> probably<00:00:27.630> heard<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.230> Walton

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so you've probably heard of like Walton

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
so you've probably heard of like Walton
pocket<00:00:29.250> watches<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.880> things<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
pocket watches and things like that and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
pocket watches and things like that and
I<00:00:30.689> don't<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.170> Walden<00:00:31.679> has<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:32.009> an

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I don't think that Walden has been an

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.120 
I don't think that Walden has been an
American<00:00:32.550> company<00:00:32.730> since<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:34.260> 50s<00:00:34.920> or

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
American company since like the 50s or

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.450 
American company since like the 50s or
like<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> late<00:00:35.610> 50s<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.149> something<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
like the late 50s or something like that

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.560 
like the late 50s or something like that
recently<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.820> understood<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.390> was

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
recently and I understood it was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.819 
recently and I understood it was
purchased<00:00:39.809> by<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.230> investor<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:42.440> they<00:00:43.440> wanted

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
purchased by an investor and they wanted

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.850 
purchased by an investor and they wanted
to<00:00:44.010> sort<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> come<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.170> interesting

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to sort of come back with an interesting

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.569 
to sort of come back with an interesting
brand<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.670> sort<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.149> celebrates<00:00:49.579> apparently

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
brand that sort of celebrates apparently

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
brand that sort of celebrates apparently
some<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> sort<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> aviation<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
some of the sort of the aviation and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.459 
some of the sort of the aviation and
military<00:00:53.129> history<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.329> brand<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.410> you

have these very modern very aggressive
men's<00:01:01.020> watches<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:01.859> their<00:01:02.190> high-end

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
men's watches that are their high-end

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.109 
men's watches that are their high-end
and<00:01:03.030> sporty<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.600> cool<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.880> I'm<00:01:05.880> fascinated

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and sporty and cool and I'm fascinated

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
and sporty and cool and I'm fascinated
by<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.930> mean<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.770> definitely<00:01:08.000> see

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
by these I mean you definitely see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
by these I mean you definitely see
popularity<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.080> brands<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
popularity with brands like this you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
popularity with brands like this you
know<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.400> blows<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> things<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
know you have your blows and things like

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.920 
know you have your blows and things like
that<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.840> sort<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.799> modern

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
that to sort of take a very modern

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.380 
that to sort of take a very modern
aggressive<00:01:16.040> technical<00:01:17.040> approach<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
aggressive technical approach to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.440 
aggressive technical approach to
timekeeping<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
timekeeping and I think that there's a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
timekeeping and I think that there's a
market<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.110> don't<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.799> for

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
market for that I don't think it's for

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.590 
market for that I don't think it's for
everyone<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> things

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
everyone but there's a lot of things

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
everyone but there's a lot of things
which<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.930> interesting<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.710> that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
which are interesting here and that's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
which are interesting here and that's
and<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.280> definitely<00:01:26.939> worth<00:01:27.060> discussing

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and that's definitely worth discussing

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
and that's definitely worth discussing
first<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
first thing here you have this kind of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.929 
first thing here you have this kind of
cool<00:01:29.909> angular<00:01:30.540> case<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:32.310> definitely<00:01:32.729> see

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
cool angular case you definitely see

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.609 
cool angular case you definitely see
sort<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.299> aviation<00:01:33.659> inspiration<00:01:34.470> where

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
sort of this aviation inspiration where

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260 
sort of this aviation inspiration where
there's<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> round<00:01:35.130> dial<00:01:35.430> looks<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there's the round dial looks kind of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
there's the round dial looks kind of
like<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> instrument<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.680> would

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
like the instrument but I like I would

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.249 
like the instrument but I like I would
sort<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> cut<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.210> corner<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.869> like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
sort of cut off in the corner and I like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.460 
sort of cut off in the corner and I like
the<00:01:40.409> angularity<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.310> case<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> big<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> 47

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the angularity the case is big it's a 47

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.580 
the angularity the case is big it's a 47
millimeters<00:01:43.649> wide<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:47.000> actually<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
millimeters wide and actually in just of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
millimeters wide and actually in just of
the<00:01:49.740> face<00:01:50.310> alone<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.790> say<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.090> 44<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the face alone they say is 44 but the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.350 
the face alone they say is 44 but the
case<00:01:52.020> i<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> 47<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.549> case<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
case i think is 47 the case here is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.109 
case i think is 47 the case here is
supposed<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.810> black<00:01:55.049> coated<00:01:55.409> titanium<00:01:56.119> but

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
supposed to be black coated titanium but

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
supposed to be black coated titanium but
if<00:01:57.210> no<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.540> told<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.229> titanium<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.399> would

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
if no one told you is titanium you would

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
if no one told you is titanium you would
you<00:01:59.880> would<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.840> it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you would not know because it's it's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.170 
you would not know because it's it's
it's<00:02:01.439> quite<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> heavy<00:02:01.950> watch<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.729> definitely

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it's quite a heavy watch it definitely

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.450 
it's quite a heavy watch it definitely
feels<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.990> steel<00:02:04.409> maybe<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
feels like it's steel maybe one of the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.069 
feels like it's steel maybe one of the
reasons<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> wait<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.509> rather

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
reasons for the wait is this rather

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.499 
reasons for the wait is this rather
thick<00:02:07.469> bezel<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.849> said<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
thick bezel which is actually said to be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.199 
thick bezel which is actually said to be
in<00:02:09.690> ceramic<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.550> pretty<00:02:11.760> cool<00:02:11.970> I've

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
in ceramic and that's pretty cool I've

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.520 
in ceramic and that's pretty cool I've
never<00:02:12.360> seen<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.690> type<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
never seen that type of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
never seen that type of
cutting<00:02:14.220> before<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> side<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
cutting before on the side there that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.410 
cutting before on the side there that
neural<00:02:16.050> pattern<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.580> ceramic<00:02:17.970> bezel

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
neural pattern there on a ceramic bezel

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.550 
neural pattern there on a ceramic bezel
so<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> think<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:19.020> definitely<00:02:19.440> interesting

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so I think that's definitely interesting

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380 
so I think that's definitely interesting
and<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.400> know<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.610> overall<00:02:20.970> fit<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.300> finish

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and you know the overall fit and finish

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.990 
and you know the overall fit and finish
is<00:02:21.600> good<00:02:21.780> again<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.740> cheap<00:02:23.069> watch<00:02:23.340> but

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
is good again it is not cheap watch but

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
is good again it is not cheap watch but
I<00:02:24.209> think<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.740> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> look<00:02:26.069> at

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I think that you're not going to look at

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.559 
I think that you're not going to look at
this<00:02:26.310> thing<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.760> oh<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.450> is

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
this thing and say oh this is this is

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.870 
this thing and say oh this is this is
cheaply<00:02:27.870> made<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.470> definitely<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
cheaply made it's definitely not so the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.440 
cheaply made it's definitely not so the
the<00:02:30.239> CDI<00:02:31.250> gmt<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> there<00:02:33.150> obviously

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the CDI gmt this is there obviously

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.270 
the CDI gmt this is there obviously
they're<00:02:33.810> gmt<00:02:34.170> watch<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.590> hasn't<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.190> not

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
they're gmt watch it hasn't it's not

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
they're gmt watch it hasn't it's not
just<00:02:35.550> your<00:02:35.670> standard<00:02:35.910> gmt<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.660> couple

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
just your standard gmt there's a couple

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.690 
just your standard gmt there's a couple
of<00:02:36.930> interesting<00:02:37.140> features<00:02:37.459> one<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.520> them<00:02:38.610> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
of interesting features one of them of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
of interesting features one of them of
course<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> ability<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.630> change<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.200> gmt

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
course is the ability to change the gmt

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.699 
course is the ability to change the gmt
hand<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:42.239> go<00:02:42.420> east<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:43.020> west<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.560> you're

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
hand to go east or west as you're

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.199 
hand to go east or west as you're
traveling<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> push<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> top<00:02:44.880> pusher

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
traveling so you push the top pusher

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.050 
traveling so you push the top pusher
here<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.930> move<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> gmt<00:02:46.650> hand<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.459> direction

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
here to move the gmt hand one direction

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.940 
here to move the gmt hand one direction
and<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.630> push<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.080> bottom<00:02:49.440> pusher<00:02:49.709> there<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and you push the bottom pusher there to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
and you push the bottom pusher there to
move<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> other<00:02:50.340> direction<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:51.690> handy

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
move in the other direction that's handy

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.410 
move in the other direction that's handy
because<00:02:52.230> most<00:02:52.590> gmt<00:02:52.980> watches<00:02:53.370> force<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.880> to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
because most gmt watches force you to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.320 
because most gmt watches force you to
sort<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.320> through<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.340> visit<00:02:56.820> one

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
sort of go through just one visit one

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.910 
sort of go through just one visit one
direction<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.560> go<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.890> way

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
direction and you have to go all the way

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.559 
direction and you have to go all the way
around<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.580> if<00:02:59.760> you're<00:02:59.910> traveling<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
around and if you're traveling and

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.449 
around and if you're traveling and
you're<00:03:00.660> frequent<00:03:01.080> traveler<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:01.800> that's

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
you're frequent traveler that's that's

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.309 
you're frequent traveler that's that's

the date so there are no windows on this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.110 
the date so there are no windows on this
dial<00:03:06.239> there's<00:03:06.690> actually<00:03:07.230> these<00:03:07.650> five

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
dial there's actually these five

dial there's actually these five
separate<00:03:09.120> hands<00:03:09.390> which<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> cool<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.410> or

separate hands which is a cool thing or

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
separate hands which is a cool thing or
that<00:03:10.680> can<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:10.980> annoying<00:03:11.190> depending<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.030> how

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that can be annoying depending on on how

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.570 
that can be annoying depending on on how
simple<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.560> dial<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
simple you like your dial and the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.970 
simple you like your dial and the
smallest<00:03:15.150> hand<00:03:15.450> there<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> middle<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.319> for

smallest hand there in the middle is for

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
smallest hand there in the middle is for

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
the date and you've been you adjust it

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.770 
the date and you've been you adjust it
by<00:03:19.170> pushing<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.680> pusher<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.450> that's<00:03:21.450> good

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
by pushing this pusher here that's good

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.080 
by pushing this pusher here that's good
and<00:03:21.989> that's<00:03:22.019> simple<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:22.709> easy<00:03:22.980> but<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and that's simple that's easy but at the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.240 
and that's simple that's easy but at the
same<00:03:24.299> time<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:25.230> given<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> placement<00:03:26.160> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
same time just given the placement of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.130 
same time just given the placement of
where<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.519> date<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.239> seems<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.079> would

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
where the date is it seems like it would

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
where the date is it seems like it would
be<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.560> tough<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.370> 2x<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.360> know<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.540> not

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
be really tough to 2x you know to not

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.750 
be really tough to 2x you know to not
accidentally<00:03:31.260> push<00:03:31.500> from<00:03:32.040> time<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.519> time<00:03:32.549> so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
accidentally push from time to time so

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.340 
accidentally push from time to time so
that's<00:03:33.120> definitely<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.570> consideration<00:03:33.840> so

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
that's definitely a consideration so

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.460 
that's definitely a consideration so
again<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.950> case<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.750> mostly<00:03:36.750> black<00:03:37.079> coated

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
again the case is mostly black coated

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.690 
again the case is mostly black coated
titanium<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:39.140> there<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.440> ceramic<00:03:41.220> bezel

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
titanium and there is a ceramic bezel

water resistant to 300 meters if you are

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.610 
water resistant to 300 meters if you are

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
going to go ahead and take it for take

going to go ahead and take it for take
it<00:03:49.739> for<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.890> dive<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:51.390> says<00:03:51.600> vanguard<00:03:52.170> on<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
it for a dive it says vanguard on the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.900 
it for a dive it says vanguard on the
back<00:03:52.590> there<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:52.859> don't<00:03:52.980> know<00:03:53.220> why<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:53.609> I

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
back there I don't know why that is I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.199 
back there I don't know why that is I
like<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.480> sort<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.750> military<00:03:55.700> plaque<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:57.000> guess

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
like the sort of military plaque I guess

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.170 
like the sort of military plaque I guess
you<00:03:57.329> could<00:03:57.480> say<00:03:57.690> style<00:03:58.410> case<00:03:58.890> back<00:03:59.160> that's<00:03:59.519> not

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
you could say style case back that's not

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.780 
you could say style case back that's not
round<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.870> has<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.560> kind<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.609> said

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
round and has that kind of like I said

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.520 
round and has that kind of like I said
military<00:04:03.239> look<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.660> that's<00:04:03.989> cool<00:04:04.230> that's<00:04:04.350> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
military look to it that's cool that's a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.860 
military look to it that's cool that's a
nice<00:04:04.709> touch<00:04:04.920> I've<00:04:05.430> seen<00:04:05.730> similar<00:04:06.239> things<00:04:06.720> on

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
nice touch I've seen similar things on

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.289 
nice touch I've seen similar things on
watches<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:08.040> name<00:04:08.340> sticks<00:04:08.730> out<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.120> mean

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
watches that name sticks out I mean

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.509 
watches that name sticks out I mean
that's<00:04:09.390> that's<00:04:09.720> kind<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.140> crazy<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:11.040> know

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
that's that's kind of crazy you know

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.250 
that's that's kind of crazy you know
Walton<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.269> mean<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.570> really<00:04:12.780> wants<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.140> to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
Walton I mean it really wants you to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.780 
Walton I mean it really wants you to
know<00:04:13.380> Walt<00:04:13.709> them<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.100> can<00:04:14.220> see<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.430> and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
know Walt them and you can see that and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.270 
know Walt them and you can see that and
that<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.180> something<00:04:15.540> great<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.410> think<00:04:16.890> I

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
that is something great so I think I

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880 
that is something great so I think I
think<00:04:17.579> from<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:18.060> sort<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.890> presentation

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
think from a sort of presentation

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.440 
think from a sort of presentation
standpoint<00:04:20.310> they<00:04:20.640> did<00:04:20.789> an<00:04:20.880> interesting<00:04:21.269> job

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
standpoint they did an interesting job

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.270 
standpoint they did an interesting job
there<00:04:21.720> with<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.200> back<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.890> let's<00:04:23.070> put<00:04:23.159> this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
there with the back so let's put this

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.730 
there with the back so let's put this
watch<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.050> funny<00:04:25.260> thing<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.500> it's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
watch on and the funny thing is it's

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.240 
watch on and the funny thing is it's
actually<00:04:26.010> surprisingly<00:04:26.460> comfortable<00:04:26.760> it's

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
actually surprisingly comfortable it's

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.580 
actually surprisingly comfortable it's
it's<00:04:27.700> not<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.940> small<00:04:28.210> watch<00:04:28.450> by<00:04:28.720> any<00:04:28.870> means<00:04:29.050> as

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
it's not a small watch by any means as

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.500 
it's not a small watch by any means as
you<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:29.890> see<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.760> is<00:04:30.910> definitely<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
you can see this is this is definitely a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.710 
you can see this is this is definitely a
larger<00:04:32.350> size<00:04:32.500> timepiece<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.220> mean<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
larger size timepiece I mean this is you

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.780 
larger size timepiece I mean this is you
know<00:04:34.840> there's<00:04:35.290> there's<00:04:35.590> entire<00:04:35.950> watches<00:04:36.520> that

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
know there's there's entire watches that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.330 
know there's there's entire watches that
people<00:04:37.510> wear<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:38.170> are<00:04:38.350> as<00:04:38.530> wide<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.130> just

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
people wear that are as wide it's just

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.640 
people wear that are as wide it's just
the<00:04:39.460> strap<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:40.060> gets<00:04:40.570> even<00:04:40.720> bigger<00:04:40.960> but

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
the strap and it gets even bigger but

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.970 
the strap and it gets even bigger but
again<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.520> was<00:04:42.670> comfortably<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.770> nice

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
again it was comfortably this nice

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.760 
again it was comfortably this nice
rubber<00:04:45.250> strap<00:04:45.580> sort<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:46.030> like<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.450> know

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
rubber strap sort of like you know

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.750 
rubber strap sort of like you know
integrates<00:04:47.770> with<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.040> design<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.520> case<00:04:48.730> I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
integrates with the design of the case I

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.820 
integrates with the design of the case I
think<00:04:49.240> its<00:04:49.540> overall<00:04:49.810> well<00:04:50.080> done<00:04:50.110> this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
think its overall well done this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.430 
think its overall well done this
particular<00:04:51.640> version<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.480> CDI<00:04:52.840> gmt<00:04:53.380> is

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
particular version of the CDI gmt is

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.190 
particular version of the CDI gmt is
called<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.950> black<00:04:54.190> matter<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.200> the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
called the black matter and that the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600 
called the black matter and that the
reason<00:04:56.560> for<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.740> shouldn't<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.190> surprising

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
reason for that shouldn't be surprising

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.070 
reason for that shouldn't be surprising
because<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:58.090> course<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:59.850> you<00:05:00.850> know<00:05:00.970> a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
because of course it is you know a

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.330 
because of course it is you know a
phantom<00:05:02.080> watch<00:05:02.290> which<00:05:02.500> means<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:02.860> all<00:05:03.040> black

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
phantom watch which means it's all black

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.220 
phantom watch which means it's all black
so<00:05:03.550> there's<00:05:03.730> different<00:05:03.820> shades<00:05:04.419> of<00:05:04.750> black<00:05:04.960> and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
so there's different shades of black and

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.409 
so there's different shades of black and
different<00:05:05.530> textures<00:05:05.980> which<00:05:06.460> allows<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.390> to

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
different textures which allows it to

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.510 
different textures which allows it to
have<00:05:07.630> any<00:05:07.900> type<00:05:08.200> of<00:05:08.260> legibility<00:05:08.980> but<00:05:09.400> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
have any type of legibility but the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.950 
have any type of legibility but the
reason<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.910> it's<00:05:10.180> called<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.510> black<00:05:10.690> matter

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
reason that it's called the black matter

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.140 
reason that it's called the black matter
or<00:05:11.260> phantom<00:05:11.800> much<00:05:11.980> is<00:05:12.190> because<00:05:12.640> essentially

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
or phantom much is because essentially

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.610 
or phantom much is because essentially
all<00:05:13.419> black<00:05:13.690> if<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.930> don't<00:05:14.140> like<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.500> all

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
all black if you don't like the all

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.500 
all black if you don't like the all
black<00:05:14.860> version<00:05:15.250> there<00:05:15.640> are<00:05:15.880> others<00:05:16.240> there's

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
black version there are others there's

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.470 
black version there are others there's
two<00:05:16.720> other<00:05:16.870> versions<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.830> CDI<00:05:18.730> gmt

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
two other versions of the CDI gmt

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.500 
two other versions of the CDI gmt
there's<00:05:20.110> one<00:05:20.169> that's<00:05:20.500> kind<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:21.270> inspired<00:05:22.270> by

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
there's one that's kind of inspired by

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.409 
there's one that's kind of inspired by
an<00:05:22.690> old<00:05:23.160> aviation<00:05:24.160> clock<00:05:24.400> it's<00:05:24.820> kind<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.090> green

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
an old aviation clock it's kind of green
