00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
with wear and tear on your using these

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
with wear and tear on your using these
machines<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.470> these<00:01:22.740> cameras<00:01:23.400> putting<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
machines are these cameras putting in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.100 
machines are these cameras putting in
and<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.180> pocket<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.869> easily

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and out of your pocket this can easily

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440 
and out of your pocket this can easily
rip<00:01:25.470> off<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.210> actually

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
rip off and this is where you actually

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.399 
rip off and this is where you actually
plug<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.790> camera<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:32.960> wire<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
plug in the camera into the wire here so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
plug in the camera into the wire here so
this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> wire<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:35.939> plug<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this is the wire you would plug it in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.569 
this is the wire you would plug it in
here<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.770> then<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.130> plug<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> into

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
here so and then you would plug it into

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.260 
here so and then you would plug it into
your<00:01:41.670> computer<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.790> download<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
your computer and then you download the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
your computer and then you download the
pictures<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.140> case<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.590> well<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
pictures in this case as well this is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.020 
pictures in this case as well this is
where<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> would<00:01:48.240> plug<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> charger

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
where you would plug it into the charger

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.499 
where you would plug it into the charger
so<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> charger<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.880> plugs<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.210> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so the charger actually plugs into this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.800 
so the charger actually plugs into this
thing<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.790> then<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.299> plug<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> into

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
thing and then you have to plug it into

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
thing and then you have to plug it into
the<00:01:58.110> wall<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.430> county<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> slaves

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the wall and then this county of slaves

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.749 
the wall and then this county of slaves
around<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> different<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.759> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
around so it's kind of different if and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600 
around so it's kind of different if and
you<00:02:03.360> guys<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> point

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you guys out there know or have a point

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.090 
you guys out there know or have a point
and<00:02:05.759> shoot<00:02:06.560> typically<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> battery<00:02:08.190> will<00:02:08.550> go

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
and shoot typically the battery will go

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.940 
and shoot typically the battery will go
into<00:02:09.370> the<00:02:09.550> charger<00:02:09.760> and<00:02:10.180> then<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.470> charger

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
into the charger and then the charger

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.430 
into the charger and then the charger
you<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.460> plug<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.120> anywhere<00:02:13.630> in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
you can just plug this in anywhere in

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.820 
you can just plug this in anywhere in
this<00:02:14.620> case<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.910> doesn't<00:02:16.300> do<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.960> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
this case it doesn't do that so you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.090 
this case it doesn't do that so you
actually<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.460> put<00:02:18.760> take<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.450> USB<00:02:20.200> plug

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
actually have to put take this USB plug

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.640 
actually have to put take this USB plug
it<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.660> you're<00:02:23.050> messing<00:02:23.410> with<00:02:23.530> this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it in here so you're messing with this

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.350 
it in here so you're messing with this
flimsy<00:02:23.950> door<00:02:24.250> already<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:25.150> showed<00:02:25.210> you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
flimsy door already I just showed you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.940 
flimsy door already I just showed you
and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.770> plug<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.190> into<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.490> thing<00:02:27.820> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and then plug it into this thing and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.980 
and then plug it into this thing and
then<00:02:29.950> plug<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.640> into<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.030> wall<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:31.780> walk

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
then plug it into the wall and then walk

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.600 
then plug it into the wall and then walk
away<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.980> little<00:02:33.190> scary<00:02:33.430> especially

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
away and it's a little scary especially

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.350 
away and it's a little scary especially
me<00:02:34.090> I've<00:02:34.860> children<00:02:35.860> running<00:02:36.280> around<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
me I've children running around and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.980 
me I've children running around and
there's<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.870> long<00:02:38.140> wire<00:02:38.410> here<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.990> this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
there's a long wire here and this

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.570 
there's a long wire here and this
process<00:02:41.470> an<00:02:41.530> accident<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.070> probably<00:02:42.340> might

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
process an accident is probably might

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.910 
process an accident is probably might
you<00:02:42.970> know<00:02:43.090> might<00:02:43.780> happen<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.500> think<00:02:44.590> there's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you know might happen so I think there's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.660 
you know might happen so I think there's
an<00:02:45.070> option<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.640> buy<00:02:45.960> another<00:02:46.960> charger<00:02:47.670> believe

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
an option to buy another charger believe

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.870 
an option to buy another charger believe
I<00:02:48.820> read<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.150> somewhere<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:50.080> look<00:02:50.230> into<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.880> on

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I read it somewhere can look into it on

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550 
I read it somewhere can look into it on
an<00:02:52.090> icon<00:02:52.390> site<00:02:52.630> there<00:02:52.780> might<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:53.080> charger

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
an icon site there might be a charger

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.660 
an icon site there might be a charger
that's<00:02:53.680> different<00:02:54.160> where<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.370> can<00:02:54.520> actually

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
that's different where you can actually

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.880 
that's different where you can actually
throw<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.150> battery<00:02:55.720> inside<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.710> is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
throw the battery inside but this is

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.830 
throw the battery inside but this is
what<00:02:57.040> comes<00:02:57.220> with<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.580> camera<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:58.780> a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
what comes with the camera so it's a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.320

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
got a little flip switch here it kind of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.150 
got a little flip switch here it kind of
flips<00:03:55.600> up

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.910 

it<00:04:00.030> clicks<00:04:00.300> in<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:01.320> what<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.620> used<00:04:01.650> to

if you flip it open this is where you

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.570 
if you flip it open this is where you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
would plug in the USB camera and then

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.490 
would plug in the USB camera and then
you<00:04:26.730> plug<00:04:27.450> beg<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> little<00:04:28.380> bit

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
you plug beg and this is a little bit

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.770

more<00:04:28.710> secure<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> me<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:32.010> coolpix<00:04:32.780> with

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
more secure to me then the coolpix with

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.190 
more secure to me then the coolpix with
that<00:04:33.990> little<00:04:34.170> piece<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.830> plastic<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:36.200> so

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
that little piece of plastic there so

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.720 
that little piece of plastic there so
that's<00:04:37.320> pretty<00:04:37.620> much<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> grippe<00:04:38.220> for<00:04:38.460> me<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
that's pretty much the grippe for me the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.130 
that's pretty much the grippe for me the
last<00:04:38.880> thing<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.420> video<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.590> HD<00:04:41.100> video

last thing is the video the the HD video

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.330 
last thing is the video the the HD video
supposedly<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.260> shoots<00:04:43.530> or<00:04:43.770> does<00:04:44.010> shoot<00:04:44.220> the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
supposedly it shoots or does shoot the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.600 
supposedly it shoots or does shoot the
HD<00:04:44.730> 1080p<00:04:45.360> but<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.110> shot<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.950> room<00:04:47.220> with

my friends were blurry so it's the the
commercial<00:06:28.310> is<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:29.360> me<00:06:29.509> it's<00:06:29.630> not<00:06:29.660> accurate

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.520 
commercial is to me it's not accurate
but<00:06:30.470> that's<00:06:30.620> just<00:06:30.710> my<00:06:30.919> opinion<00:06:31.210> so<00:06:32.229> log<00:06:33.229> it<00:06:33.410> out

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
but that's just my opinion so log it out

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.150 
but that's just my opinion so log it out
and<00:06:33.880> my<00:06:35.320> sudden<00:06:36.320> you<00:06:36.440> guys<00:06:36.590> nose<00:06:36.889> in<00:06:37.130> my

and my sudden you guys nose in my

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.879 
and my sudden you guys nose in my
opinion<00:06:37.580> I<00:06:38.050> probably<00:06:39.050> would<00:06:39.289> not<00:06:39.380> get<00:06:39.620> the
