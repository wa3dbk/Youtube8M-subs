00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
acres but only a third of that is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
acres but only a third of that is
planted<00:01:26.250> under<00:01:26.310> mine<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.350> really

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
said it allowed us to start researching

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
said it allowed us to start researching
and<00:01:40.200> experimenting<00:01:40.830> with<00:01:40.950> grapes<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and experimenting with grapes that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.540 
and experimenting with grapes that
normally<00:01:42.780> hadn't<00:01:43.320> been<00:01:43.500> grown<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.040> Tuscany<00:01:44.520> or

normally hadn't been grown in Tuscany or
focused<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:46.140> had<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.650> range<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
focused on because we had the range of

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.790 
focused on because we had the range of
microclimates<00:01:47.460> soil<00:01:48.450> types<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.650> this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
microclimates soil types to do this

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920 
microclimates soil types to do this
experimentation<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.210> location<00:01:51.240> we

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
experimentation all in one location we

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.510 
experimentation all in one location we
didn't<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.230> to<00:01:52.350> move<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.680> different<00:01:53.100> parts

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
didn't have to move to different parts

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.610 
didn't have to move to different parts
of<00:01:53.610> Italy<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.480> do<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> work<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.230> could<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.470> done

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
of Italy to do the work it could be done

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.730 
of Italy to do the work it could be done
under<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.190> location<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.970> one<00:01:57.180> team<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.200> we

registered<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.019> work<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> Italian

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
registered that work for the Italian

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.480 
registered that work for the Italian
government<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.670> we're

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
government so we're

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.280 
government so we're
the<00:03:12.610> only<00:03:13.000> single<00:03:13.270> producer<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.840> Italy<00:03:14.140> ever

the only single producer in Italy ever

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.130 
the only single producer in Italy ever
to<00:03:14.500> actually<00:03:14.860> register<00:03:15.070> their<00:03:15.580> work<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
to actually register their work in the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.340 
to actually register their work in the
goal<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.740> really<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.060> share<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.630> results<00:03:19.810> so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
goal is really to share the results so

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.530 
goal is really to share the results so
that<00:03:20.380> everybody<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.400> territory<00:03:21.970> could

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
that everybody in the territory could

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.420 
that everybody in the territory could
start<00:03:22.840> making<00:03:23.230> better<00:03:23.380> Santa<00:03:23.860> raises<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
start making better Santa raises and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.550 
start making better Santa raises and
particularly<00:03:24.970> better<00:03:25.720> brunello<00:03:26.470> di

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
particularly better brunello di

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.130 
particularly better brunello di
montalcino<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.300> we're<00:03:28.450> tasting<00:03:28.690> here

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
montalcino so what we're tasting here

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.110 
montalcino so what we're tasting here
today<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.680> really<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.460> result<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
today is really the result of the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.550 
today is really the result of the
breakdown<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:32.340> 2010<00:03:33.450> clonal<00:03:34.450> selection

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
breakdown of the 2010 clonal selection

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.870 
breakdown of the 2010 clonal selection
so<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.620> can<00:03:35.860> kind<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.430> how<00:03:36.610> each

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
so you can kind of see how each

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.290 
so you can kind of see how each
different<00:03:37.210> type<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.660> clone<00:03:38.080> lends<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.980> certain

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
different type of clone lends a certain

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.120 
different type of clone lends a certain
characteristic<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> Sangiovese<00:03:41.440> because

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
characteristic to the Sangiovese because

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.040 
characteristic to the Sangiovese because
some<00:03:42.310> people<00:03:42.610> think<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:42.970> maybe<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.480> Brunello

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
some people think that maybe a Brunello

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.730 
some people think that maybe a Brunello
he<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.460> sangiovese<00:03:45.940> gross<00:03:46.330> but<00:03:47.260> really

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
he is just a sangiovese gross but really

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.070 
he is just a sangiovese gross but really
sangiovese<00:03:48.370> Grosso<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.210> one<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> clones

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
sangiovese Grosso is one of the clones

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.190 
sangiovese Grosso is one of the clones
that<00:03:50.320> mix<00:03:50.530> up<00:03:50.680> with<00:03:50.800> Manila<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:52.030> use<00:03:52.330> about

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
that mix up with Manila so we use about

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.500 
that mix up with Manila so we use about
15<00:03:53.740> different<00:03:53.920> types<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.550> depending<00:03:55.330> on

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
15 different types and depending on

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.810 
15 different types and depending on
whether<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.440> have<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> reserve<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.070> Brunello

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
whether you have a reserve of Brunello

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.470 
whether you have a reserve of Brunello
you're<00:03:58.300> using<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.870> Super<00:03:59.260> Tuscan<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.670> have<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
you're using a Super Tuscan you have the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.150 
you're using a Super Tuscan you have the
various<00:04:01.930> different<00:04:02.350> clones<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.980> can

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
various different clones that you can

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.100 
various different clones that you can
really<00:04:03.310> select<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:04.180> today<00:04:04.480> we're<00:04:04.720> breaking

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110
