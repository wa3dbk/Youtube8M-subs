00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.500 
mix one-half ounce round silver rounds
and<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.719> timing<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.859> purchase<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:18.210> not

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and the timing on this purchase is not

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.109 
and the timing on this purchase is not
great<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.380> go<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
great because if we go into a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
great because if we go into a
deflationary<00:00:21.470> wave<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.189> things<00:00:23.460> are

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
deflationary wave then these things are

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.849 
deflationary wave then these things are
going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> worth<00:00:24.600> less<00:00:24.990> than<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.350> paid<00:00:25.830> for

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
going to be worth less than I paid for

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
going to be worth less than I paid for
them<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> reason<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.990> doing<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
them but the reason I'm doing this is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.640 
them but the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.670> deflationary<00:00:30.300> waived<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because in a deflationary waived all of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.740 
because in a deflationary waived all of
the<00:00:31.800> week<00:00:32.009> banking<00:00:32.669> players<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the week banking players are going to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
the week banking players are going to
start<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> hatch<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.700> it's<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.910> someone<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
start to hatch out it's like someone is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.090 
start to hatch out it's like someone is
trying<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> shoo<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.170> birds<00:00:37.350> from<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> bush

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
trying to shoo the birds from the bush

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
trying to shoo the birds from the bush
said<00:00:38.760> someone<00:00:39.030> else<00:00:39.180> could<00:00:39.390> shoot<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.899> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
said someone else could shoot them and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.010 
said someone else could shoot them and
that's<00:00:40.800> exactly<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.790> case<00:00:41.969> we're<00:00:42.300> backing<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that's exactly the case we're backing is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
that's exactly the case we're backing is
today<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> wave<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> deflation

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
today and if we have a wave of deflation

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
today and if we have a wave of deflation
stocks<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> go<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.620> wouldn't

gas and I think this should be about

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
gas and I think this should be about
four<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.780> five<00:01:51.840> gallons<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> gas<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.100> i<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.430> no

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
four or five gallons of gas so i have no

a deflation because they leveraged all

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.310 
a deflation because they leveraged all

of your customer funds if banks blow up
you'll<00:04:07.620> at<00:04:07.739> least<00:04:07.770> have<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.730> then<00:04:08.970> you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
you'll at least have this and then you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.140 
you'll at least have this and then you
could<00:04:09.300> make<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.140> valuable<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:11.040> comparison<00:04:12.000> to

could make it valuable in comparison to

could make it valuable in comparison to
other<00:04:12.330> things
