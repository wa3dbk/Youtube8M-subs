00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 I am being that you can find me in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.279
 twitter by arroba is navas 10 and in this 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.349
 video I want to do the full analysis 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.960
 from an application that I loved 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.910
 that sums coffee if you like the cinema and you 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.570
 like TV series 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.220
 TV sofa application is a must 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.960
 it's an authentic past today we're going to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 analyze let's see a little bit if you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 like to you is not an application 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390
 that is payment that is universal and that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 it's worth 0 89 euros 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.310
 the truth is that for the price 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 It is very cheap for everything it does 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.010
 we are not going to get into the application 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's see a little bit first 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 options that we have we have first the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 movie tab then we have the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 tab of series then we have the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.890

 episode of the third season good 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.360
 I put it with the bell here 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.429
 calendar would leave me when they are going to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.650
 Brand new because these next ones 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.720
 chapters of this white series ended up 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 every good hour then also apart from the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.360
 calendar that is to see that to see 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 the series that are going to be released 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.730
 soon 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
 we have the history where we are going to see 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.120
 a little bit the series that I movies 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.800
 that I've been fiddling with 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 looking we are not going to go here to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.980
 movies because we're going to see a little bit 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.780
 how it is ordered to be fixed that we click on 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.970
 the little button on the top right and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 see that we can order all 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.860
 these movies by popular the most 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.420
 valued we can go to the movies 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.430
 who are now in movies or we have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 All these categories we will not choose 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 For example, the popular ones do not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.440
 let's also go to the settings 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.510
 because here we can change the subject 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.890
 we can select the language as 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.810
 You are watching in English Spanish German 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
 Italian Portuguese which we 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 We want to see how the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.970
 movies at the end not then little things 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.580
 interesting we have here about 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.380
 accounts series point li shares 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.479
 punctual a web page that I recommend 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 that you register because you are going to be able to see 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.380
 the cinema of online series and in addition 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.300
 also you are going to be able to everything that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.400
 I like the most is that you can mark the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.680
 series as seen, you can have 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.750
 there then a history of the chapters 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 that you have already seen is to not lose yourself 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.720
 there is no knowing where you are going in each 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 moment with each series not good this is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.110
 one way are 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.400
 the application we're going to go to the mother of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.050
 lamb let's go for example to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.420
 any of these movies are we going to 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.950
 get into the thor for example fixed 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.450
 who here to start we see you then 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 good one cover the truth that is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.840
 pretty cool we see a synopsis that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.000
 is in Spanish and this is appreciated 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.980
 quite then we see here the cast 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840
 We can choose us in any of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.099
 these actors and we would leave movies 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 related for example let's catch 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.209
 this one has only made the movie 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.489
 of thor and appears here not good we're going to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 go below because apart from this 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.360
 We have different options below for 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.790
 start we have movies similar to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.290
 this is not the first part and such and then 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.030
 we have different things here we are going to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.290
 see the comments of the people of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.880
 according to what people say about this 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.709
 movie if it's good or if it's bad not 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.660
 also fixes the ones that we will be able to see the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.220
 trailer we will be able to see images and 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.920
 about the best of this application 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.079
 we will be able to see these movies all 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.090
 these movies we could even look for 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.170
 films such as going to look 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.569
 brave heart 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.910
 tips for example a movie of my 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.890
 favorite to see that we see 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.660
 now we could see this movie 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.670
 we can see it through itunes 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.349
 buying it or renting it or through 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.610
 of typical streaming servers 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.440
 as for example well anyone of 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.880
 all of these there is mogollón let's choose 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.220
 for example the play 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.750
 point to be here to notice us 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.330
 appears when we press these three 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.920
 options we can open in safari so 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.300
 So we would not see the film because 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.090
 you know that the safari browser does not 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.010
 supports flash and these videos at 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.530
 end they are in flash and you can not see them 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.209
 in the safari web browser we can not 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.290
 send by email link or we can 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.150
 copy the link and that's why now we're going to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.950
 go to another application that is also 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.540
 very well that is called video explorer a 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
 application that we already reviewed in the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.680
 description we will leave the link to 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.470
 explorer video review but it's so 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.000
 simple as it is a web browser 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.250
 vitaminized because it also allows us 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.080
 play streaming videos of 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.180
 any format and typical 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.160
 conventional servers also in 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.919
 serve the programmer is Spanish and we 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.419
 He said that if we know or you 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.320
 you know a server that does not know 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.480
 support 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.030
 this explorer video application that is 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.590
 say it that puts it to zero the truth 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.550
 is that it updates very quickly 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.250
 good to see that in this browser 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.530
 we will paste the url that we have copied from tv 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.600
 sofa and we would give intro and 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.910
 automatically when you load the page 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.110
 we are going to have two options thanks to 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.520
 this explorer video application 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.470
 we could watch the online video as 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.020
 you are watching or we could download 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.030
 this video we are going to give you to watch online 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.200
 see if this works does not work 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.270
 good to see that it is working 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.310
 we are perfectly seeing this 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.720
 one hundred percent movie and things 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.970
 remarkable is that we could 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.030
 share to see this movie by the 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.980
 play we are not going to leave here the apple 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.900
 tv I mean because the truth is that the 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.730
 apple tv is very good but it has 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.010
 certain shortcomings but thanks to leigh 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.600
 play s vitamin very much the use of 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.610
 apple tv and us with these 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.890
 applications we could look for a series 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.360
 a movie to throw it to the crop 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.670
 directly through go play no 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.350
 let's go to tv again because 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.880
 you have already seen that this works we are going 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.260
 to continue with the revised because there 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.880
 something that I want to comment on the subject of 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.710
 the series for example the series that 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.760
 like this one of peak band theory 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.160
 the truth is that I am following 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.570
 we can mark as favorite with this 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.040
 a quote from up here to the right 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.230
 when we press it we mark as 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.490
 favorite a series or good for a 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.290
 movie what we want 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.700
 we have here the same as in the 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.350
 movies but also here we have a 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.450
 thing called seasons where 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.610
 us what I like the most about 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.200
 this is that we can choose a season 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.210
 for example let's catch season 1 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.920
 and tell him that we have seen certain 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.020
 chapters or up right with 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.570
 the eye we mark as all this 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.460
 season we've seen something really 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.620
 pretty cool then we would get in here 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.960
 select any chapter and 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.570
 we would have the same thing we could see then 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.610
 this chapter whole and completely 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.160
 free good because this is what the 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.320
 application an exquisite application a 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.140
 mask of the good the truth is that 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.190
 if you like the television series the 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.380
 Movies is an application 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.060
 essential plus I like it 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.740
 so much for being able to mark 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.970
 all the chapters that I have as views 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.280
 I now used another application 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.010
 used division tracker used tv 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.110
 and used to activision but this tv 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.820
 sofa does the same and apart vitaminada 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.190
 because we have series links 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.170
 point law to be able to see then any 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.670
 of these movies not so good guys 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.430
 and girls this has been the review of this 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.340
 the tv sofa app that is a more cap 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.810
 of the good ones if you are movie lovers and 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.130
 from the series good guys and girls here
