looking at a defensive win that I had

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
looking at a defensive win that I had
with<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.390> old<00:00:27.630> base<00:00:27.869> layout<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.740> second

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
with my old base layout the second

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
with my old base layout the second
defensive<00:00:29.640> win<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.240> my<00:00:30.390> new<00:00:30.599> post<00:00:31.019> update

base<00:00:31.859> layout<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> we'll<00:00:33.210> talk<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.780> in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
base layout and we'll talk about that in

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530 
base layout and we'll talk about that in
a<00:00:33.989> minute<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.130> looks<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.399> maybe<00:00:35.760> I'm

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
a minute so it looks like maybe I'm

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
a minute so it looks like maybe I'm
being<00:00:36.809> hit<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.050> farmers<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.950> guess<00:00:38.190> they're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
being hit by farmers I guess they're

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.940 
being hit by farmers I guess they're
coming<00:00:38.670> after<00:00:38.820> me<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.750> low-cost<00:00:40.410> armies

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
coming after me with low-cost armies

coming after me with low-cost armies
Giants<00:00:41.520> goblins<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> archers<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> can

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
Giants goblins and archers as you can

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
Giants goblins and archers as you can
see<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.890> he<00:00:44.340> did<00:00:44.579> bring<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.090> spells<00:00:45.510> but

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
see here he did bring five spells but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.729 
see here he did bring five spells but
I'm<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:45.989> sure<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I'm not sure if we're going to see the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
I'm not sure if we're going to see the
use<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.070> anywhere<00:00:47.550> near<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.000> five<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> those

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
use of anywhere near all five of those

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
use of anywhere near all five of those
spells<00:00:48.899> he<00:00:49.620> gets<00:00:49.829> through<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.160> outside

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

buildings<00:00:51.180> obviously<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> collector<00:00:52.890> base

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
buildings obviously not a collector base

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
buildings obviously not a collector base
but<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> where<00:00:54.090> my<00:00:54.149> storages<00:00:54.780> are

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
but because of where my storages are

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
but because of where my storages are
towards<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> outside<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> little

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
towards the outside they are a little

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
towards the outside they are a little
bit<00:00:57.059> easier<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> sending<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
bit easier to get to sending in the

truly undefeated it has never lost a
defense<00:01:52.770> ever<00:01:53.100> uh<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.170> defended

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
defense ever uh but it's only defended

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
defense ever uh but it's only defended
once<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.399> okay<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.299> did<00:01:57.450> pretty<00:01:57.659> well

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
once but that's okay it did pretty well

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.190 
once but that's okay it did pretty well
uh<00:01:58.939> unfortunately<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.329> looks<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.810> maybe<00:02:00.990> I'm

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
uh unfortunately it looks like maybe I'm

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.859 
uh unfortunately it looks like maybe I'm
being<00:02:01.439> farmed<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.250> by<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:03.060> champions<00:02:03.659> in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
being farmed now by these champions in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the 3300 or so range maybe they're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
the 3300 or so range maybe they're
getting<00:02:06.719> ready<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> update<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:08.190> I've

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
he only brought three spells and so it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.870

beginning to look a little bit like

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940 
beginning to look a little bit like
that's<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.810> what<00:02:19.200> they're<00:02:19.380> after<00:02:19.770> they're

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.880 
am in the 32 to lo 3,300 s is somewhere
I<00:02:27.060> haven't<00:02:27.300> been<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> long<00:02:28.050> time<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.710> maybe

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
I haven't been in a long time so maybe

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.890 
I haven't been in a long time so maybe
this<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.790> happening<00:02:30.180> down<00:02:30.330> here<00:02:30.390> now<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.840> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
this is happening down here now and I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
this is happening down here now and I
just<00:02:31.110> haven't<00:02:31.290> seen<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.640> any<00:02:32.820> case

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
just haven't seen it but in any case

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.820 
just haven't seen it but in any case
maybe<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.690> quick<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.050> easy<00:02:34.290> way<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> get

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
maybe it's a quick and easy way to get

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.120 
maybe it's a quick and easy way to get
back<00:02:35.070> up<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> 34<00:02:35.940> 3,500<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.050> kind<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.980> this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
back up to 34 3,500 I kind of like this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.800 
back up to 34 3,500 I kind of like this
base<00:02:38.400> layout<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.000> sort<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.420> southern

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
base layout it's sort of a southern

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.710 
base layout it's sort of a southern

very high hitpoints structures those

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
very high hitpoints structures those
storages<00:02:48.390> kind<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.080> serving<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.650> walls

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950

hoping that those defenses stacked right

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.850 
hoping that those defenses stacked right
there<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.090> help<00:02:54.270> burn<00:02:54.600> them<00:02:54.840> down<00:02:55.050> here<00:02:55.650> comes

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
not handled well so they're going to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.790 
not handled well so they're going to
help<00:02:59.610> slow<00:02:59.850> things<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.720> win<00:03:01.410> another
