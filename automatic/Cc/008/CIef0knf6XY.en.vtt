00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hello, I decided to tell you no matter how 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.269
 strange it sounded about how to score 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.370
 metal pin into the ground without the bulldozer 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.519
 without a ladder of almost any length 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.490
 drowning within three four meters there 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.430
 even up to five meters in general it 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 what is it for well people who 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.500
 engaged in electrical work 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 elite so easy installers for some 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 metal structures in their work 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 it happens that you need to make a contour 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 ground or equation circuit 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 potential and how it comes to clogging 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.309
 pins here there is a problem immediately 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.620
 you need a ladder you need a sledgehammer here you are 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 steam and slaughter others will tell you 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.989
 here you can cut there three meters by 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.870
 meter to score one pin to weld 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.590
 cook another and so on but I will say 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 immediately what for some requirements 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.049
 welding vertical grounding she 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.570
 prohibited and with such a problem can 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.909
 collide when you make a contour 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 grounding for example which substation and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.380
 the fact is that if something suddenly 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.229
 happen and about and will be produced 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.909
 examination and will find your cut 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 pins this really big 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.439
 problem now i will tell and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 make life easier for many installer we 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:37.770
 some people who are with this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:41.159
 facing see that I even have here 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.079
 asphalt path here edge but chose 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 and solid ground now on the example of this 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.470
 solid soil I will tell and show you how 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.470
 it's all done 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.200
 see that I have nothing about 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.670
 need god bucket with water or bottle with 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:18.709
 water and he hammer pin shallow 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:27.620
 land do well then in this race 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:30.110
 just pour our water on like this 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.920
 here's the way you swing when here 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.400
 begin to steal land of course while 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.870
 can 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:57.140
 and splatter dirt if we are in work 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:59.090
 clothes that's okay here we are 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.230
 hammered the pin further in the process 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.200
 you can already finish the tip. 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 sledgehammer no problem 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.850
 process as the ground settles at the pins 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.959
 we will be squeezed so that his hands will not 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.959
 reach and not pull out 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:31.400
 since my phone turned off now 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:04:12.110
 try again parts listen what 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 pebbles see that no problems clogged 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.910
 so who is this way to make life easier 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.070
 put a finger up but who does not need it 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.070
 thumb down but good luck everyone all bye
