I<00:05:51.490> lovely<00:05:52.680> when<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.710> first<00:05:53.919> picked<00:05:54.159> him<00:05:54.340> up<00:05:54.400> I

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
I lovely when I first picked him up I

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.800 
I lovely when I first picked him up I
thought<00:05:54.789> there<00:05:55.000> was<00:05:55.120> no<00:05:55.150> way<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.419> would<00:05:55.659> learn

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
thought there was no way I would learn

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.469 
thought there was no way I would learn
how<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.080> use<00:05:56.139> them<00:05:56.699> but<00:05:57.699> with<00:05:57.849> time<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.389> a

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
how to use them but with time and a

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.140 
how to use them but with time and a
whole<00:05:58.659> lot<00:05:58.870> of<00:05:58.990> losing<00:05:59.580> it<00:06:00.580> became<00:06:00.939> like

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
whole lot of losing it became like

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.610 
whole lot of losing it became like
second<00:06:01.569> nature<00:06:01.599> to<00:06:01.930> go<00:06:02.110> between<00:06:02.259> these

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
second nature to go between these

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.769 
second nature to go between these
stances<00:06:02.889> so<00:06:03.699> hopefully<00:06:04.090> these<00:06:04.240> are<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.539> intro

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779
