00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi so well we'll start with a 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.880
 little poem is not it during this show 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.290
 the mixture of a sugar fund has drained the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 bread dough that is through a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 true to caramelize what 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.350
 gives kenya bad texture 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 melting inside crisp and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.060
 caramelized outdoors good ben lo 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 that's what's waiting for you go it's 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240
 left 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.220
 we start by making a dough a fear 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.050
 with water flour the little web 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.430
 hours that we will have melted and the yeast 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 rappe write this dough for a 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.510
 ten minutes after which we go the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.800
 let it rise in the fridge during 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 about two hours 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 m 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.340
 kouign amann this job does it like 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.680
 a puff pastry 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.300
 we will make a rectangle of fear 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.909
 we will still cry in the dough 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.210
 so here I have my butter we will work 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.210
 shaped rectangle and the strange 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 I 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.320
 I stop 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 gold 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 so here I spread my paw on a 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.140
 thickness of about 4 mm and I'm going 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.570
 to be able to integrate the butter so the buzz 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:09.490
 does half of my kompakt label and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 I passed my father and I come 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.630
 now close up cover severe 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.860
 totally and are well closed on the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:28.270
 edges the ethical standard mans a little bit 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.770
 tap the butter and cold the drop is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.480
 cold 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.459
 so are important to work 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.800
 this cold paste just beats 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.130
 to prevent the softened butter from 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.540
 too much and that sticks to your plan of 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.990
 work so since we're going to work 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.800
 like a puppet we are going to position 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.060
 the paw always in the manner of a 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.890
 book as if we were going to open a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180
 book we will work this dough 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.350
 like a puff pastry we will give 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.670
 two rounds 5 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.670
 I'm spreading whoever asks him 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.450
 and I fold in three 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.960
 I position myself the dough as if 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.180
 it was a book I was going to open a 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.410
 always like that on the dough in 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 analyzing and I give directly the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.590
 second turn to turn a little bit of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:27.830
 flour underneath it does not stick 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.830
 second round of flour elections 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.610
 we will pack the patent in 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.720
 cellophane and let's rest 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.720
 for an hour in the cool 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.430
 I take advantage of the rest of the dough for 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.010
 prepare the cooking words so we 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.930
 rocking in circles posed this silpat 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.459
 and if you're not this morning at the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.290
 home could curiosity molds to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.300
 tartlets like that or even 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.660
 what other dish of the moment they are 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.660
 well gilded 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.510
 we now give two more tricks 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.130
 but this time in the south this is 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.290
 keep our heritage still in the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.670
 same meaning in the blood a book like 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.500
 if we opened the book always the same 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.150
 we will spread it in the sugar ok we go 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.150
 use sugar like flour 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.030
 I'm still scared in fact half of the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.540
 sugar on the first round be the 3rd 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:48.290
 turn that is done in the sugar times 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.449
 offered his paw way booker way and 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.160
 it's gone in the other direction suc 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:57.580
 received will be thoroughly below in the 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.580
 sugar 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:09.020
 seguin between sugar in the dough and I 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.700
 give the last round like these to 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.950
 present to see our paw spread 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.900
 thickness of 4 mm the fat acuÃ±a man is 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.370
 ready she asks more than to be molded 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.490
 you still have flour is a 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:30.290
 little bit if it sticks a papou m I 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.450
 now cut squares so we're going 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.690
 make eight cars and level small kouign 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.690
 amann 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.240
 we will take a little bit of sugar 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.949
 more of the recipe and we will shape 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.169
 our kouign amann in the sugar then 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.120
 here I have my little square 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.249
 first time 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.669
 g game to the center like that 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:03.020
 agree those angles there the golden age to hurt 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.659
 also 20 201 safin givet frankly 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.520
 I'm not afraid here is my little kouign 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:15.229
 amann is ready and I deposit it in the 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:16.639
 circle is now allowed to rest 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.249
 balls are two at a warm place 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.490
 and covered with an age for 45 minutes 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.349
 be careful not a place too much you are there 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.029
 too hot if not the melted butter in 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:31.629
 September cooking these 20 minutes 180 Â° 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.629
 convection 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.979
 no 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.149
 and we immediately go to circles and 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.569
 the ammann balls before he 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.569
 cool 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.660
 I wanted to say that I decline any 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.060
 responsibility for taking kilos 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.310
 possible is not it not my 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.070
