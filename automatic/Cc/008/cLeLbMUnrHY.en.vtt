00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.260
 very good to all youtubers my name 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.830
 it's tony and this is all we're in 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.070
 fitness and nutrition section today 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.349
 let's do chapter 2 where I'm going to 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.769
 explain easily how to do yours 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.769
 own diet 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.430
 you have to set a goal for 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.880
 design this diet either lose weight and 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.520
 be maintain or be gain weight 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.460
 The first thing we need to know is 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 what is made up in our diet 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.810
 mainly consists of what they are 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.450
 the macronutrients the fat lipids 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.579
 carbohydrates or carbohydrates 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.149
 and the proteins 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.129
 in a diet focused on fitness we are going to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 give greater importance to what are the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.420
 proteins 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.210
 let's take carbohydrates in moments 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.730
 strategic of the day and let's try 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.620
 take healthy fats start with the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.760
 diet design the first thing that 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 we need to know is how many calories 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 we will have to take the first thing that we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.820
 we will have to calculate is our rate 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 basal metabolic what does this mean or 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.850
 insane this means the calories 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 necessary that our body needs 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 to stay daily without doing 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.070
 no exercise is to say for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 survive our body our mind 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.620
 spend a series of calories depending 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 of our age our height and weight 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.610
 I'm going to show you a calculator that I've 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.000
 done me so you do not have to do 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.160
 no calculation you this calculator 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.159
 is a file in excel and that you are going to 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 find in the video description 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.310
 this format will appear 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.659
 nutritional calculator all and what 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.369
 first thing we have to do is 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.880
 select the goal as we have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.310
 explained we can 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.420
 have a goal to lose weight 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.310
 objective to maintain or we can have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.310
 the goal of increasing the weight of 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.690
 agreement in this case I'm going to mark the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.610
 increase in weight 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.670
 here what we will have to put is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.830
 our weight our age and height 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.890
 activity rate activity rate 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.290
 will depend 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 what kind of activity do you do 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.990
 daily or the one you want to start 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.310
 to do is to say if you do not want to do anything 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.440
 of exercise the active rate is going to be 1 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.290
 I recommend you to start as 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 minimum do 3 days a week of 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 gym and one day of exercise 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.800
 cardiovascular so what are we going to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 to do is mark intense activity 1,6 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.290
 once we will have all the data 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.890
 posts are going to calculate us 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.960
 directly the basal metabolic rate and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.500
 we are also going to calculate the 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.070
 daily calories is worth in this case for 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.800
 a person of 80 kilos and a half 181 and 25 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.720
 years with an intensity an activity 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.320
 intense will need 3,514 calories 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.690
 for your diet for a weight gain 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.490
 here what we have is the division of 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.080
 these calories in the different 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.630
 macronutrients proteins carbohydrates 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.410
 and fats are also going to calculate us 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 the daily grams then to know 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.740
 how many grams of protein 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.690
 carbohydrates and fats we need to 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.350
 every meal the only thing we're going to do 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.530
 is to divide this is result by the 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.200
 meals that we do once we have the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.420
 daily caloric amount that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.100
 we will need to ingest to get to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.410
 our goal 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.080
 we will have to divide those calories 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.020
 between the three types of macronutrients 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.670
 for fats we will dedicate 20% 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.220
 of what the formula has come out 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.650
 previous 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.050
 for the case of proteins we are going to 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.299
 do 40 percent and for the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.090
 carbohydrates another 40 percent 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.490
 this is to begin with when we go 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.880
 moving forward you will see that a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.060
 little is we have to take into account 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 than for proteins and carbohydrates 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.680
 a single gram of these macronutrients 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.710
 has four calories while in the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.510
 case of fats each gram of fat 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:47.030
 has nine calories a breakfast other 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.540
 breakfast at mid morning depending on 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.590
 lessons lift a meal a 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.800
 snack and a people 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.530
 this is a basic level is to say this 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.450
 to start with if you make three meals 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.470
 you are going to have to make two more meals 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.510
 If you want to start taking better care of us 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.810
 have optimal results with the 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.590
 exercise that we will talk about later in 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.480
 another video and who is not targeted to a 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.780
 gym that does not do the exercise that 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.540
 start 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.090
 start is the most important thing then let's go 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.919
 to see what kind of exercise that routine 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.960
 with what 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:32.790
 we will do it, but if 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.910
 you want to start doing something 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.670
 go for a run 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.830
 and go by bike to sign up for some 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.140
 gym near home 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.970
 nowadays and these low cost gyms 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.350
 that do not cost a lot of money and that you 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.560
 offer all the possibilities for 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.360
 exercise and monitors that you 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.760
 can you help with what you know now 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.270
 you can start a healthy diet or 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.790
 less health design 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.230
 surely you are going to have to change the 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.160
 way to buy food 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.290
 and we'll also talk about that in videos 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.900
 so it's true that looking at you 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.900
 fridge you will surely see things 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.570
 that it would be better to invest in others 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.830
 healthier things 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.260
 although it costs a little more money but 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.710
 if you want results you're going to have to 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.199
 do what 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.040
 Finally say that if you liked 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:28.830
