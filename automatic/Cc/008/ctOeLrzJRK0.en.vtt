giving<00:00:13.350> you<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.650> guide<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.219> how<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.459> be<00:00:14.699> a<00:00:14.730> better

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
giving you a guide on how to be a better

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.939 
giving you a guide on how to be a better
engineer<00:00:15.600> now<00:00:16.080> first<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.770> need<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
engineer now first of all you need a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.070 
engineer now first of all you need a
proper<00:00:17.160> class<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:18.690> class<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
proper class now as your class you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900 
proper class now as your class you
should<00:00:19.109> obviously<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:20.010> using<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> engineer

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
should obviously be using the engineer

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.760 
should obviously be using the engineer
because<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.420> can't<00:00:21.690> be<00:00:21.870> much<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.110> an<00:00:22.320> engineer

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
because you can't be much of an engineer

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.680 
because you can't be much of an engineer
without<00:00:23.130> being<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.730> engineer<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.450> makes

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
without being an engineer that makes

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.010 
without being an engineer that makes
sense<00:00:24.900> right<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.730> pistol<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.420> choose<00:00:27.810> what

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
sense right and pistol just choose what

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.720 
sense right and pistol just choose what
you're<00:00:28.170> comfortable<00:00:28.440> with<00:00:28.860> if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.520> can't

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you're comfortable with if you can't

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.029 
you're comfortable with if you can't
decide<00:00:30.060> use<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.630> other<00:00:30.750> guide<00:00:31.110> for<00:00:31.350> that<00:00:31.560> but

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
decide use my other guide for that but

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.100 
decide use my other guide for that but
you<00:00:32.160> should<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.460> keeping<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.000> mind<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.539> being

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you should be keeping in mind that being

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
you should be keeping in mind that being
an<00:00:34.230> engineer<00:00:34.410> means<00:00:34.949> that<00:00:35.129> you<00:00:35.309> should<00:00:35.340> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
an engineer means that you should be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360 
an engineer means that you should be
close<00:00:35.879> range<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.480> maybe<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> magnum<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
close range so maybe the magnum or the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.889 
close range so maybe the magnum or the
m9a1<00:00:38.880> would<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.810> better<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.440> job<00:00:41.600> for<00:00:42.600> mo

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
m9a1 would be better for this job for mo

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
m9a1 would be better for this job for mo
is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.140> same<00:00:43.320> again<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.040> pick<00:00:44.310> whatever<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is the same again just pick whatever you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.319 
is the same again just pick whatever you
want<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.130> you<00:00:47.130> think<00:00:47.700> fits<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.210> best

trills faster so that's pretty logical

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
trills faster so that's pretty logical
for<00:00:56.010> an<00:00:56.130> engineer<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.540> also<00:00:57.719> help

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
for an engineer and you can also help

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.049 
for an engineer and you can also help
your<00:00:58.230> teammates<00:00:58.770> by<00:00:59.160> giving<00:00:59.520> their<00:00:59.670> faster

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
equipment you should be picking either

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.130 
equipment you should be picking either
the<00:01:04.500> sentries<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.430> wood<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:06.020> nothing<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the sentries or the wood sure nothing is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.559 
the sentries or the wood sure nothing is
bad<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.069> you<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.639> two<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:08.999> the<00:01:09.030> best<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
bad but you these two are the best and

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.559 
bad but you these two are the best and
if<00:01:10.259> you're<00:01:10.340> thinking<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.639> picking<00:01:11.819> the<00:01:11.999> IMS

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
if you're thinking of picking the IMS

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.419 
if you're thinking of picking the IMS
you<00:01:13.289> shouldn't<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.009> you're<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.399> one

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
you shouldn't because you're the one

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.469 
you shouldn't because you're the one
protecting<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.179> real<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> IMS<00:01:16.859> so

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
protecting that real and not the IMS so

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
protecting that real and not the IMS so
that's<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.749> what<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.709> should<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.039> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that's not what you should be doing for

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.949 
that's not what you should be doing for
the<00:01:20.759> last<00:01:20.789> part<00:01:21.029> of<00:01:21.179> your<00:01:21.270> class<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.929> should

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
the last part of your class you should

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.160 
the last part of your class you should
be<00:01:22.229> picking<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.740> MK<00:01:23.039> 32<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.630> shield<00:01:24.929> if

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
be picking the MK 32 or the shield if

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
be picking the MK 32 or the shield if
you<00:01:25.350> feel<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.069> need<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.399> extra

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you feel like you need some extra

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.419 
you feel like you need some extra
protection<00:01:27.149> while<00:01:27.810> repairing<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.499> drill<00:01:28.740> but

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
protection while repairing the drill but

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.160 
protection while repairing the drill but
i<00:01:29.459> think<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.119> amplitur<00:01:30.539> t2<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
i think that the amplitur t2 is a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
i think that the amplitur t2 is a
logical<00:01:31.619> choice<00:01:31.649> as<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.849> engineer's<00:01:33.479> last

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
logical choice as the engineer's last

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.419 
logical choice as the engineer's last
upgrade<00:01:34.049> gives<00:01:34.499> you<00:01:34.619> more<00:01:34.799> explosive<00:01:35.279> damage

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
upgrade gives you more explosive damage

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.849 
upgrade gives you more explosive damage
and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.029> k<00:01:36.240> 32<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:37.170> devastating<00:01:37.709> on

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
and then k 32 is pretty devastating on

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.370 
and then k 32 is pretty devastating on
its<00:01:38.039> own<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.539> allow<00:01:39.749> you<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.289> lot

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
its own this will allow you to do a lot

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.589 
its own this will allow you to do a lot
more<00:01:40.439> damage<00:01:40.829> while<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.909> being<00:01:41.939> an<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.359> weapon

even<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:52.830> without<00:03:53.040> engineer<00:03:53.790> they<00:03:54.060> do<00:03:54.210> a<00:03:54.240> lot

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
even if without engineer they do a lot

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.930 
even if without engineer they do a lot
of<00:03:54.570> damage<00:03:54.960> so<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.010> shouldn't<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.580> ignoring

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
of damage so you shouldn't be ignoring

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.610 
of damage so you shouldn't be ignoring
the<00:03:57.180> explosive<00:03:57.660> weapons<00:03:57.930> they<00:03:58.080> are<00:03:58.140> actually

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the explosive weapons they are actually

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.820 
the explosive weapons they are actually
not<00:03:58.800> bad<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.810> when<00:04:00.810> I'm<00:04:00.960> repairing<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
not bad and when I'm repairing and

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.860 
not bad and when I'm repairing and
protecting<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.520> drill<00:04:02.820> it's<00:04:03.240> okay<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.630> go

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
protecting the drill it's okay to go

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.550 
protecting the drill it's okay to go
down<00:04:04.110> as<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:05.730> are<00:04:06.030> not<00:04:06.540> worth<00:04:06.990> more<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
down as you are not worth more than the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
down as you are not worth more than the
drill<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.550> really<00:04:08.790> goes<00:04:08.970> down<00:04:09.210> you<00:04:09.660> lose

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
drill if the really goes down you lose

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.320 
drill if the really goes down you lose
if<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.290> go<00:04:10.530> down<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.520> medic<00:04:11.760> can<00:04:11.970> pick<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.270> up

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
if you go down the medic can pick you up

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.210 
if you go down the medic can pick you up
so<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.440> make<00:04:14.250> sacrifices<00:04:14.790> if<00:04:15.060> needed<00:04:15.390> and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
so just make sacrifices if needed and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.460 
so just make sacrifices if needed and
when<00:04:17.220> repairing<00:04:17.640> just<00:04:18.480> remember<00:04:18.960> to<00:04:18.989> throw

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
when repairing just remember to throw

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.250 
when repairing just remember to throw
down<00:04:19.650> your<00:04:19.710> boosters<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.900> always<00:04:21.900> worth<00:04:22.080> it

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
down your boosters it's always worth it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.680 
down your boosters it's always worth it
and<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.860> will<00:04:23.460> be<00:04:23.670> having<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:24.030> lot<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.180> cash<00:04:24.510> as

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
and you will be having a lot of cash as

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.659 
and you will be having a lot of cash as
an<00:04:24.810> engineer<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.130> should<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:26.490> always

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
an engineer so you should be always

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.730 
an engineer so you should be always
throwing<00:04:27.210> down<00:04:27.390> your<00:04:27.780> boosters<00:04:28.169> as<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:28.590> helps

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
upgrades you have two of them they will

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.960 
upgrades you have two of them they will
protect<00:04:55.570> each<00:04:55.720> other<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:57.310> should<00:04:57.490> also

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
protect each other and you should also

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.600 
be running traps in in the background
somewhere<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:02.530> should<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:03.010> total

somewhere and you should have total

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.760 
somewhere and you should have total
coverage<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.330> map<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.690> you<00:05:04.750> should<00:05:05.350> make

coverage of the map and you should make

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.520 
coverage of the map and you should make
the<00:05:05.980> job<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.490> whole<00:05:06.790> lot<00:05:07.000> easier<00:05:07.570> for<00:05:08.110> your<00:05:08.320> team

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
the job a whole lot easier for your team

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.409 
the job a whole lot easier for your team
because<00:05:09.010> apart<00:05:09.280> from<00:05:09.400> those<00:05:09.730> three<00:05:09.970> parts<00:05:10.360> of

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
because apart from those three parts of

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.080 
because apart from those three parts of
your<00:05:10.630> class<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.470> traps<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:12.010> MK<00:05:12.340> 32<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
your class the traps and MK 32 and the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.270 
your class the traps and MK 32 and the
sentry<00:05:13.360> gun<00:05:13.510> you're<00:05:14.080> not<00:05:14.290> tilling<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:15.070> much

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
sentry gun you're not tilling that much

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.400 
sentry gun you're not tilling that much
damage<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.210> that's<00:05:16.450> your<00:05:16.570> main<00:05:16.840> damage<00:05:17.050> output

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
damage so that's your main damage output

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.040 
damage so that's your main damage output
and<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.950> should<00:05:18.130> be<00:05:18.250> focusing<00:05:18.669> on<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.050> your
