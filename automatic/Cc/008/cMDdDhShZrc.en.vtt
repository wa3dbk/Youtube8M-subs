00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.029
 low and I here to whom they are 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.790
 and we're going to make black bean brownies 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.970
 the train is just to taste brownies 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.090
 also delicious chocolate only yes 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.250
 chocolate brownies don't look really healthy 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.040
 so entertain with the clean invent 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.690
 and you make it by using black beans 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 use 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.079
 black beans you hear it right 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 chocolate and I already made a pass to 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.950
 test it out and to whom put it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.170
 just tasted and what did you think of it 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.390
 it was very tasty and amazing 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.860
 it tastes like chocolate and that sounds 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.820
 very sarcastic but I think 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.260
 it really tasty 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.879
 I was really happy with it, I believe 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.460
 still not having black beans in it 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.780
 were therefore from the now itself 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.930
 to discover 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.080
 well i just made it so yeah me 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:18.050
 we gonna go now for everyone to prove 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.630
 yes so take a good look and yes if you 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.840
 make you like that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.950
 I hope and well I am very curious how 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.369
 we are going to do this 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.520
 ok didge no push we go we are 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.520
 on the way 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.500
 leak bin brownies or black beans 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.920
 Brownies are very simple and quick to 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.829
 to make 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.770
 what you need is black bean eggs 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.659
 stevia seed cocoa powder coconut oil 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.880
 baking powder 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.789
 start with the clean and dry blender 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.670
 forward ball does not add the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.979
 eggs 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.970
 and then you simply do the rest of it 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.970
 the ingredients 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 stevia 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.459
 salt the cocoa powder 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 this is a fourth cunt plus an extra 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 tablespoons that are really tasty chocolate 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:32.780
 taste time then you do the coconut oil 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:37.900
 at last 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.900
 baking powder vanilia 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.780
 I use your adolescent vanilla extract mini 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.140
 farmers use everything 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.370
 then a little mixed up 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.370
 used really really tasty 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.269
 and then blend it but make sure it 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.859
 a liquid mixture becomes like your own 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.840
 mixture is thick you can get one small 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.500
 add some water but make sure you do 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.280
 not too much later than the paper in one 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.690
 baking mold 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.170
 I now use a square baking pan 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.720
 michael simply presses and then you can 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.579
 master of your favorites 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.579
 make sure you spread it well over the 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.220
 whole container full of shape and everywhere just as full 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.430
 is then heat the over for 175 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.209
 degrees and your brownies can go for 25 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.209
 minutes in the oven 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.190
 to make sure it's ready 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.049
 you can poke in with a toothpick 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.650
 if the skewer comes out clean she will 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.650
 interest is ready 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.240
 you are completely ready 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.420
 let it cool down for a while then it is 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.460
 easier to cut when 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.570
 that has cooled completely you can use the 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.840
 brown flat cut 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.200
 no this is not secretly the brown is 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.200
 demolished 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.720
 get ready yes well these are the bruijn 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.040
 not become and now film outside 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.360
 under the light in my kitchen with the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.990
 shade and everything just a moment too 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.540
 is dark and we are going to this one 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.020
 passion u taste they are also cooled 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.410
 and I am really very curious after first 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.479
 or me 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.479
 screen first i'm this piece 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.800
 it really looks exactly like one 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.800
 draw farley 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.139
 I smile because yes the camera a bit 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.139
 heavy 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.720
 probably now also wash brahmasmi 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.530
 by 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.530
 you want a lot 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.090
 is not exactly the same but it is 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.400
 really super tasty you can taste one 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.760
 difference apart but I just you 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.760
 nice than that just my previous bee 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.760
 really tasty oh and as a tip too 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.130
 say whatever 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.030
 yes these are now no surprise 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.220
 but yes I did on purpose because 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.840
 again fewer calories you can too 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.610
 sprinkle that dot of powder over it anyway 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.169
 as a decoration 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.150
 yes if you thrown that stevia over 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.500
 then it is just like powdered sugar 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.479
 I don't think that is necessary myself 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.250
 as tasty but as you think I think 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.200
 it not sweet enough or if you walked i 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.570
 the smart that surprise or something then yes 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.950
 I don't give you anything on your can either 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.950
 frosting with stevia 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.720
 you will film the lay with the laptop 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.050
 so a bit heavy 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.849
 so this is how you make clean brownies 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.410
 and i hope you like it beat me 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.210

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.210
 bye Bye 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.640

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.640
