the previous clip as basically a working

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.630 
the previous clip as basically a working
minime<00:01:32.750> stone<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.380> minecraft<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.460> way

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
minime stone and minecraft now the way

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.960 
minime stone and minecraft now the way
this<00:01:34.790> works<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.299> actually<00:01:35.930> up<00:01:36.200> here<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.970> we

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
this works is actually up here and we

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.670 
this works is actually up here and we
have<00:01:38.090> our<00:01:38.210> system<00:01:38.539> running<00:01:39.049> over<00:01:39.259> here<00:01:39.500> and

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
have our system running over here and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.859 
have our system running over here and
the<00:01:40.250> way<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.520> all<00:01:40.640> works<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
the way this all works is we have a

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.929 
the way this all works is we have a
constant<00:01:42.320> clock<00:01:42.619> that's<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.460> into<00:01:43.670> test

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
constant clock that's going into test

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.120 
constant clock that's going into test
for<00:01:44.149> all<00:01:44.390> players<00:01:44.689> with<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.049> score<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.530> craft

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
for all players with a score of craft

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.399 
for all players with a score of craft
minium<00:01:46.580> one<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.270> crafts<00:01:47.960> minium<00:01:48.320> is

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
minium one and crafts minium is

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.289 
minium one and crafts minium is
basically<00:01:48.770> an<00:01:48.860> objective<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:49.549> saying<00:01:49.850> if

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
basically an objective that's saying if

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.100 
basically an objective that's saying if
anybody<00:01:51.020> has<00:01:51.140> crafted<00:01:51.380> Simon<00:01:51.890> block<00:01:53.110> what

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
anybody has crafted Simon block what

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.480 
anybody has crafted Simon block what
happens<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.590> going<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:54.799> set<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:54.979> back<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.250> zero

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
happens is going to set it back to zero

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.490 
happens is going to set it back to zero
so<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:55.789> reusable<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.959> a<00:01:57.049> nuclear<00:01:57.380> all

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
so it's reusable it's a nuclear all

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 
so it's reusable it's a nuclear all
players<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.979> diamond<00:01:58.250> block<00:01:58.539> it's<00:01:59.539> going

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
players of the diamond block it's going

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.080 
players of the diamond block it's going
to<00:01:59.990> give<00:02:00.200> everyone<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.770> blank<00:02:01.280> map<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:02.060> says

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
to give everyone a blank map that says

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.779 
to give everyone a blank map that says
minium<00:02:02.659> stone<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.259> it's<00:02:04.220> going<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.549> set<00:02:04.759> our

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
minium stone and it's going to set our

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.730 
minium stone and it's going to set our
durability<00:02:05.390> which<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.869> customizable<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:06.709> i

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
durability which is customizable but i

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.840 
durability which is customizable but i
have<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.009> set<00:02:07.039> to<00:02:07.220> 100<00:02:09.340> what's<00:02:10.340> also<00:02:10.489> going<00:02:10.729> to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
have it set to 100 what's also going to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.449 
have it set to 100 what's also going to
do<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.180> check<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.930> if-then<00:02:12.530> durability

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
do is check for if-then durability

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.949 
do is check for if-then durability
becomes<00:02:13.940> 0<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.810> play<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
becomes 0 and it's going to play the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.600 
becomes 0 and it's going to play the
break<00:02:18.140> sound<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.650> also<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.310> set<00:02:19.459> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
break sound and also in here and set it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.330 
break sound and also in here and set it
clears<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.319> now<00:02:21.319> what<00:02:21.440> else<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.769> doing<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.190> this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
clears it now what else is doing is this

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.130 
clears it now what else is doing is this
is<00:02:22.489> basically<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> transportation<00:02:23.840> set<00:02:24.049> up

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
is basically the transportation set up

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.949 
is basically the transportation set up
here<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.470> which<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.430> yes<00:02:25.610> expandable<00:02:26.209> it'll

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
here and which is yes expandable it'll

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.160 
here and which is yes expandable it'll
clear<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.349> players<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.890> 358<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.060> what<00:02:29.180> 358<00:02:29.900> is

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
clear all players of 358 and what 358 is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.360 
clear all players of 358 and what 358 is
is<00:02:30.739> basically<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:32.049> full<00:02:33.049> map<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.920> can't<00:02:34.310> use

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
is basically a full map and I can't use

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.920 
is basically a full map and I can't use
that<00:02:34.489> cuz<00:02:34.760> my<00:02:34.850> durability<00:02:35.180> 0<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
that cuz my durability 0 and have to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.479 
that cuz my durability 0 and have to
craft<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.590> new<00:02:36.709> one<00:02:36.859> but<00:02:37.640> what<00:02:38.510> would<00:02:38.570> happen<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
craft a new one but what would happen is

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.580 
craft a new one but what would happen is
358<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.609> a<00:02:40.640> written<00:02:40.910> map<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.690> also<00:02:42.230> known<00:02:42.470> as

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
358 is a written map so I also known as

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.340 
358 is a written map so I also known as
what<00:02:42.799> happens<00:02:43.130> when<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.340> right-click<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:44.350> so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
what happens when you right-click it so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.380 
what happens when you right-click it so
it'll<00:02:45.709> also<00:02:45.920> go<00:02:46.220> into<00:02:46.370> giving<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.090> new

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it'll also go into giving you a new

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.830 
it'll also go into giving you a new
minium<00:02:47.780> stone<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:49.519> will<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> few

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
minium stone and it will have a few

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.660 
minium stone and it will have a few
things<00:02:50.870> now<00:02:51.320> firstly<00:02:51.739> as<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.100> command<00:02:52.579> block

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
things now firstly as a command block

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.490 
things now firstly as a command block
this<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.060> basically<00:02:53.450> if<00:02:53.660> someone<00:02:53.930> has<00:02:54.079> this

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
this is basically if someone has this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.240 
this is basically if someone has this
item<00:02:54.859> id<00:02:55.569> clear<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.989> give<00:02:57.709> them<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.010> new

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
item id clear it and give them this new

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.640 
item id clear it and give them this new
item<00:02:58.549> id<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.180> more<00:02:59.359> of<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.780> for

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
item id and for more of it and for

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.289 
item id and for more of it and for
collated<00:03:01.040> 5<00:03:01.250> because<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.150> thought<00:03:02.239> that

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
collated 5 because I just thought that

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.670 
collated 5 because I just thought that
would<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.840> obviously<00:03:03.140> everything<00:03:03.500> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
would be and obviously everything is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.800 
would be and obviously everything is
customizable<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:04.549> design<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.660> also

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
customizable in this design and also

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.680 
customizable in this design and also
every<00:03:06.290> time<00:03:06.560> an<00:03:06.769> output<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.519> used<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.420> will

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
every time an output is used it will

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.559 
every time an output is used it will
remove<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.680> my<00:03:09.859> durability<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.609> like

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
remove one of my durability and like

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.440 
remove one of my durability and like
over<00:03:11.810> there<00:03:11.989> once<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.470> hits<00:03:12.620> zero<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:13.459> will<00:03:13.519> pop
