stone<00:00:56.670> I'll<00:00:57.120> show<00:00:57.269> you<00:00:57.359> how<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> now

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
stone I'll show you how to do that now

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.619 
stone I'll show you how to do that now
the<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.429> step<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> measured<00:01:00.210> mark<00:01:00.449> out

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the first step is the measured mark out

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
the first step is the measured mark out
the<00:01:00.780> locations<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.440> each<00:01:01.530> light<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.429> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the locations for each light I use a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.320 
the locations for each light I use a
spacing<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> every<00:01:03.179> 6<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> 7<00:01:03.899> feet<00:01:05.090> next<00:01:06.090> take

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
spacing of every 6 to 7 feet next take

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
spacing of every 6 to 7 feet next take
your<00:01:06.360> masonry<00:01:06.840> chisel<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.290> begin<00:01:07.590> forcing<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
your masonry chisel and begin forcing it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.380 
your masonry chisel and begin forcing it
between<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> cap<00:01:08.730> stone<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> stone

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
between the cap stone and the stone

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
between the cap stone and the stone
below<00:01:09.870> as<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.650> advance<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> chisel<00:01:11.460> you'll

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
below as you advance the chisel you'll

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
below as you advance the chisel you'll
feel<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> glue<00:01:12.270> between<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.750> stones<00:01:12.990> begin

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
feel the glue between the stones begin

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
feel the glue between the stones begin
to<00:01:13.470> break<00:01:13.680> free<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.910> cap<00:01:15.090> stones

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to break free with the cap stones

now<00:01:57.290> I'm<00:01:57.350> securing<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.920> fixture<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
now I'm securing the fixture with the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.190 
now I'm securing the fixture with the
masonry<00:01:59.000> anchors<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.600> screws<00:01:59.630> that<00:02:00.110> were

masonry anchors and screws that were

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.230 
masonry anchors and screws that were
provided<00:02:00.740> with<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.950> light<00:02:01.160> now<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.119> an

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
provided with the light now this is an

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.570 
provided with the light now this is an
optional<00:02:02.630> step<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.740> actually<00:02:03.950> even<00:02:04.460> just

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
optional step you can actually even just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.640 
optional step you can actually even just
glue<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> light<00:02:05.450> in<00:02:05.600> place<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.170> use<00:02:06.500> the

glue the light in place and use the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.160 
glue the light in place and use the
weight<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.130> block<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.760> hold<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.119> down<00:02:08.270> I'll

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
weight of the block to hold it down I'll

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.810 
weight of the block to hold it down I'll
go<00:02:09.320> ahead<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.649> mark<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.039> holes<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.520> we'll

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
go ahead and mark the holes and we'll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.590 
go ahead and mark the holes and we'll
show<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.030> how<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.270> do<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.660> step<00:02:13.209> use<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.239> small

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
show you how to do this step use a small

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.050 
show you how to do this step use a small
hammer<00:02:14.930> drill<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> masonry<00:02:15.950> bit<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.970> then

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
hammer drill with a masonry bit and then

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.000 
hammer drill with a masonry bit and then
the<00:02:17.150> holes<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.570> marked<00:02:18.140> drill<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.770> about

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the holes we just marked drill out about

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.430 
the holes we just marked drill out about
1/2<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.640> 3/4<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> an<00:02:20.360> inch<00:02:20.480> deep<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.350> our

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
connection is going to be made inside

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.320 
connection is going to be made inside
the<00:03:41.590> wall<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> cable<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.000> already

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
the wall to the cable that is already

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.600 
the wall to the cable that is already
placed<00:03:43.630> there<00:03:43.900> first<00:03:44.800> we<00:03:44.950> need<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.190> cut<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
placed there first we need to cut the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.100 
placed there first we need to cut the
cable<00:03:45.910> where<00:03:46.030> we<00:03:46.120> want<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.420> make<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.810> splice

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
cable where we want to make the splice

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.259 
cable where we want to make the splice
then<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.069> need<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.310> move<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.670> out<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.060> way

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
then we need to move it out of the way

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.270 
then we need to move it out of the way
otherwise<00:03:49.930> it'll<00:03:50.170> get<00:03:50.349> cut<00:03:50.590> by<00:03:50.739> our<00:03:50.860> grinder

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.830 

take<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:54.430> grinder<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.090> grind<00:03:55.330> out<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.540> slot

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
take your grinder and grind out a slot

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.199 
take your grinder and grind out a slot
as<00:03:56.019> we<00:03:56.110> did<00:03:56.260> before<00:03:56.380> making<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.430> groove<00:03:57.819> for<00:03:58.030> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
as we did before making a groove for the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.690 
as we did before making a groove for the
wire<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:59.049> only<00:03:59.319> go<00:03:59.500> half<00:03:59.830> way<00:03:59.860> through<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.610> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
wire but only go half way through to the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.300 
wire but only go half way through to the
center<00:04:00.910> of<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.030> stone<00:04:01.830> next<00:04:02.830> we'll<00:04:03.130> take<00:04:03.250> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
center of the stone next we'll take the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.870 
center of the stone next we'll take the
grinder

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
grinder

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.220 
grinder
we're<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.209> do<00:04:04.330> enlarge<00:04:04.750> out<00:04:05.049> that

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
we're going to do enlarge out that

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.470 
we're going to do enlarge out that
central<00:04:05.680> groove<00:04:05.920> make<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.090> bit<00:04:07.239> wider

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
central groove make it just a bit wider

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.880 
central groove make it just a bit wider
so<00:04:07.690> it'll<00:04:08.019> accommodate<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.650> new<00:04:08.769> connection

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
so it'll accommodate the new connection

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.350 
so it'll accommodate the new connection
let's<00:04:11.890> go<00:04:12.040> ahead<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.459> strip<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.819> wires<00:04:13.030> and

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
let's go ahead and strip the wires and
