00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.590
 it is not something for stepchildren and easy 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.750
 make a braid that you can 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 people are wearing the wedding is all 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.910
 we are doubtful of having hairstyles 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 risk my god as i do stepson 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.519
 so it works out good and if you stay in doubt and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.490
 people have faith, we have people who spoke 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.699
 then the 20 wing will follow you and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 you do not france then look 60 scene house 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.040
 used without a key this weave is a braid 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 built in from there and is a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.379
 exchange that gives to us at home it 7 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 and 15 years with the tour you can use and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.809
 abuse and even day- to-day 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.820
 likes a hairstyle but used only use the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 dish lighter bullet and was dark 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 dance and that's when I think you 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.309
 they will like 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.340
 Let's play at home the first step. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 essential drawer facilitated closed 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.000
 I let it go just let it not crash 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.400
 further 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 then you choose the side you like the most 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 take photos 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 Why do you cross and play on one side? 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 because I think it 's more chic you give 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.860
 one in which the transition formed if 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.290
 I love the team so much I always 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 I choose for that side the staff can 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.979
 take snapshots that I always 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.210
 pressured by risk 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.310
 so I'll just fire on that side 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.770
 You get to do as a phrase 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.979
 repeated in other regional 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 we start to take part in the test 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:48.540
 You start to make us will play 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 this first thought I could do 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 braid 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.780
 I think maybe it helps you there you go 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 play because messi plays for example the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 Left, I also think you will not want to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:12.090
 mei joined with this average is played and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:19.380
 played together, playing everything in the middle of the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:25.440
 goal through the kiss here or in goiÃ¡s 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.650
 there in gave another has a little more 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.890
 while taking only on that side of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.890
 here 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:51.810
 now you get the pomegranate in the middle is the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.049
 next I think it's transparent here 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.519
 Why does she look like she thinks 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:12.299
 when we go to the party is 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:15.180
 more beautiful and now I really am 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.880
 close to the ear and I'll drop a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.910
 yes, overthrown because those 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.140
 aces here we will pick up and will 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.360
 make the dogs 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.430
 is now coming to the farm predicts 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 initiatives left over 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.500
 if you want to be let loose yet another 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.760
 little to overcrowd the supernatural 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 Do you know France? 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.390
 I love to loose and fit in the exchange and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.630
 are here is very special because to see 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.370
 with a braid like that it gets a little 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.350
 I do not know the judgment 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.120
 There I hurt her hair, I'll go 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.620
 rolling 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.620
 I like to surf both sides. 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.400
 they decreased 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.640
 I prefer it with the foot I think 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.950
 giving a pineapple also treated is 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.530
 super beautiful be what is super easy to 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.210
 make a braid super stripped and gives 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.820
 for us to use on several occasions I 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.010
 I love using a party to go out at night. 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.140
 chic is a pretty braid and the house is 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.450
 Beautiful, I know you there with them. 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.370
 that's when I really hope that you 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.280
 You liked me, I'm not much to do. 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.560
 closed the training players well 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.960
 already was the only one of 11 houses have to do with 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.750
 children 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.970
 Jesus, but I never wanted to do them all. 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.670
 them in the world because using each 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.410
 vote for me that I'm a little suspicious is 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.480
 which I hate at gala 3 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.870
 so when I was in the text in your 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.960
 work and this braid is super go real 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:16.960
 You can use it on several occasions 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:20.410
 I'm sure you want me to have it. 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.300
