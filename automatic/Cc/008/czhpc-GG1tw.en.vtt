00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 other characters in this series 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.759
 together they will all form the doll 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.000
 the years 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.280
 It's good people, so it 's just lipstick. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.759
 that outside the cart is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.170
 note that it accompanies these two parts 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.140
 here from the damages 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.159
 the staff that is a trunk of the damage 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.159
 just look at this here that looks good here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.759
 I do not know where you live, you do not know what to call 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.260
 This one here is but it 's part of the doll. 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.180
 bild the solitary figure 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.890
 're oba replace staff he appeared in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.670
 captain america movie the soldier 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.140
 winter 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.360
 it is clear that he did not have this 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.210
 visual and comic books 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.460
 but he was that villain that the captain 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.260
 america faced inside the boat 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.280
 Captain America was even using that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.250
 uniform 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.910
 him at the beginning of the movie and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.590
 face the guy the villain even has 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.530
 uniform as it resembles a bit of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.800
 lipstick, it's okay 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.320
 in comics it's beast to go in a style 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.870
 fight called salvatti which is the style 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.360
 Fight using your legs rather 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:00.000
 Okay, the lipstick doll that the staff is 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:05.430
 very basic is there ó he has a standard of a 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.320
 very basic puppet doll even just 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.450
 as a new head sculpture 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.110
 probably using the same body 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.550
 that other previous characters of the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.760
 same size 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.680
 only a new head sculpture 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.410
 new head 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.850
 switch exactly like in the comics 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:33.900
 weirdo're 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:39.390
 look only the character that in the moral does not give 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:44.580
 to understand why the second ray 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.830
 category and is only present in 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.530
 stories of those of the captain's avengers 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.110
 america means good 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.610
 the joints are basic there of all 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.989
 the figures more colleges 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.900
 look at the arm and jirak at the height of the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.160
 shoulder is here at the time of be sex 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.670
 He turns, we have that elbow. 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:14.299
 that turns doubling up is okay 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.870
 hand rotates and moves back and forth down 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.790
 OK 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.079
 he has this articulation here or in the 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.490
 height pain 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:27.990
 the trunk it spins here at the height of 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.500
 and joints and patterns in the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:39.270
 Legs are personal to move here in 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:49.590
 leg here turns knee bending total 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:55.110
 He has a rotation here, oh boot, and then 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.389
 you can make several positions with 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.319
 the tokyo lipstick mainly giving 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.500
 kick 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:06.840
 already here behind us is the detail of the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.569
 paint it he has a painting like that 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.849
 yellow means golden're not enough to 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:19.289
 be glittery to a so golden 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:26.279
 matte was to put the character 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:28.529
 those existing characters marvel 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.969
 colleges including flying characters 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.120
 and you can put it in the most 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.190
 positions so cool flying in case 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.129
 here in lipstick I had a base 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:45.240
 that I would put it is given a blow 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:47.279
 It would be cool, damn it. 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.529

 and marvel and in morals I do not know very well 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.810
