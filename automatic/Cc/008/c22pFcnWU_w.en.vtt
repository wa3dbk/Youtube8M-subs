 hello do you believe there is today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.519
 our studio is a bike project 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.670
 2014 model is called exe 250 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 model are about in the middle 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.490
 rulers that is, it is not quite 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.310
 entry level bike slightly higher 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 on components now more 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.769
 tell you by 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 let's start with classic aluminum with 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.820
 flat round pipes bottom pipe 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.460
 to improve strength just under 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 flattened pay attention to such 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 pleasant oval frame of the classical form 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.510
 no arrests are present kerchiefs 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.239
 gain this option increases 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.309
 frame strength 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 Samara simple reliable have all 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.360

 bike rack mounting bolts 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 climbing walls duplicated 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.670
 not worth the budget but very good. this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.290
 like 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:38.230
 times but what is this high-grade stormy 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.970
 this is a surefire heck on wife stocks with 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.400
 toner 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.020
 i.e. preload adjustment 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.060
 this is the softness of the work of the velties softness 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.400
 the plug will work work also 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.890
 You can use this twist setting 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:01.590
 your weight shopping chief editor at home for being

 indian radio operator disk mechanics 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 Adequate good brake architect 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 tektro novela model mages brakes 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.680
 fully adjustable adjustment 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.950
 externally pads by stretching the track 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.640
 twist and feed and the column is internal 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.140
 hex pads 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 insert hexagon turn and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 adjust the pad i.e. the whole brake 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.840
 ok and good problems with these 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.020
 brakes roshen and gentle brakes which 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.269
 are working 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.530
 move on to the transmission office I'm here already 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.600
 We were pleased with the brake handle 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.600
 two separate switches 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.680
 things 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.500
 switch switch and here you are 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.840
 fully all transmission firm with slave 8 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 speed transmission 8 rear and 3 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.160
 in front 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:06.330
 classic coins here stand on wednesday 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:16.299
 four x4 here is one pen pen from 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:20.620
 Shiman which is convenient simply 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.390
 and reliably but the entire male transmission 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.860
 when I know myself very much recommended 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.049
 as it is very reliable 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.700
 transmission here is a little bit different 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.740
 system unlike shimano 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.590
 And I prick reliable more better job 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.260
 in mud in dirty conditions are good 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.510
 reliable switch as for 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.580
 switches rear sram switch 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.520
 x3 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.710
 the easiest in the line but if 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.350
 compare example Schwann analogs 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.920
 it's about shimano channels somewhere 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.290
 acera 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.470
 that is, it is already in shamanic dimensional 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.720
 good switch level 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.580
 the switch works just reliably 1 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.380
 heavy spring 1 lemon cable 1 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.900
 creatures on these taxes when there is no 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.390
 bend here will not catch anything 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.420
 we will not break due to this supply 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.860
 as long as the shirts go front 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:19.660
 the switch also costs nsm video 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.220
 same x 3 only simpler option 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.700
 This is a line for urban bikes 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.980
 put it here because x 3 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.040
 Now the sky in the lineup will go to the secrets 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.900
 it is worth 8 speed cassette good 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.600
 reliable cassette is already obtained 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.300
 the youngest played up to 2 8 speed 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.920
 The transmission starts at 8 speed 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.080
 Joytec cassette tape 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.420
 good producer ie example g 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.020
 because it is one and the same order again because 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.020
 if you know 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.140
 wheels 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.280
 eccentric clip front two days you 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.040
 case 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.450
 and for the extreme cord on the side of the building 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.320
 without a tool and we are pretty here 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:13.790
 flat but these are all two films 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.760
 alexrims model dm 18 good reliable 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.130
 quality shoes armored selection 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.060
 but here in general itâ€™s worth saying that 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.040
 everything here is done with a brand walk or 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.110
 just a set of accessories here her on 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.280
 squirrels 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:35.840
 everywhere I am on the frame 1 seat here 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.169
 even here is such an element see in 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.680
 style before the saddle frame is also a gain 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.419
 in the same color that's still there, they are 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.919
 visible and Circuits as a pair of knitting needles 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.379
 for example made white too 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.080
 looks pretty stylish here and 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.240
 highlights 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.259
 here's another thing here too 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.249
 liked that is 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.550
 gentlemen righteousness fourteenth year 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:04.069
 the design is generally happy with these bikes 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.129
 of course the light scheme in general is on 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.080
 amateur but generally not hired 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.249
 interesting enough to investigate it 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.060
 bike in 19 size and without it 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:21.139
 bicycle 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:23.259
 we are 14 to 200 to 14 are six of us 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.509
 bike with pedals and that's it 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.550
 this instance if you still 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.300
 stayed on course what you go on
