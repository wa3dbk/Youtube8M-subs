inch above the base of the subfloor so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.230 
inch above the base of the subfloor so
when<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.800> go<00:02:58.950> out<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.400> put<00:02:59.550> our<00:02:59.640> mortar<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.060> we

when we go out and put our mortar in we

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.980 
when we go out and put our mortar in we
want<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.810> sloped<00:03:01.310> upwards<00:03:02.990> again

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
that does work its way down through the

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.750 
that does work its way down through the
mortar<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.500> hits<00:06:52.680> the<00:06:52.800> membrane<00:06:53.070> liner<00:06:53.250> will

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
mortar and hits the membrane liner will

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.820 
mortar and hits the membrane liner will
go<00:06:53.970> out<00:06:54.090> through<00:06:54.120> the<00:06:54.270> weep<00:06:54.450> holes<00:06:54.690> into<00:06:55.350> the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
go out through the weep holes into the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.000 
go out through the weep holes into the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
drain okay so now I'm in the process of

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.350 
drain okay so now I'm in the process of
actually<00:06:59.630> trying<00:07:00.630> out<00:07:00.960> some<00:07:01.260> mortar<00:07:02.240> once<00:07:03.240> I

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
actually trying out some mortar once I

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.390

get<00:07:03.510> enough<00:07:03.720> in<00:07:04.230> the<00:07:04.440> bottom<00:07:04.710> of<00:07:04.800> the<00:07:04.860> pan<00:07:05.100> I'll

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
get enough in the bottom of the pan I'll

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.080 
get enough in the bottom of the pan I'll
then<00:07:05.580> load<00:07:06.480> it<00:07:07.190> with<00:07:08.190> a<00:07:08.220> different<00:07:08.430> mortar

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090
