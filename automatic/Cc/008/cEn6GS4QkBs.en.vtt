00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:07.169 
just wanted to give you just a little

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.070 
just wanted to give you just a little

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
people don't know when I was a little me

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
people don't know when I was a little me
and<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.290> sister's<00:00:13.679> used<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.980> always<00:00:14.429> suck<00:00:14.639> my

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and my sister's used to always suck my

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.640 
and my sister's used to always suck my
thumb<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.570> had<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
thumb so we had the you know the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.350 
thumb so we had the you know the
band-aid<00:00:17.040> and<00:00:17.310> hot<00:00:17.550> sauce<00:00:17.820> stone<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.540> and<00:00:20.360> even

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
band-aid and hot sauce stone I and even

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.580 
band-aid and hot sauce stone I and even
though<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> didn't<00:00:22.050> want<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.320> teeth<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
though I didn't want my teeth to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.270 
though I didn't want my teeth to
protrude<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:24.080> still<00:00:25.080> wanted<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> figure<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
protrude I still wanted to figure out a

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.040 
protrude I still wanted to figure out a
way<00:00:26.370> how<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.820> could<00:00:27.150> suck<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.570> thumb<00:00:27.600> without

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
way how I could suck my thumb without

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.100 
way how I could suck my thumb without
that<00:00:28.380> happening<00:00:28.620> and<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.270> got<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.600> thinking

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
that happening and so I got to thinking

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.099 
that happening and so I got to thinking
if<00:00:31.609> you<00:00:32.609> can<00:00:32.820> suck<00:00:33.089> your<00:00:33.300> thumb<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.750> push<00:00:33.929> your

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
if you can suck your thumb and push your

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.000 
if you can suck your thumb and push your
teeth<00:00:34.289> out

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
teeth out

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.189 
teeth out
why<00:00:35.699> can't<00:00:36.089> you<00:00:36.300> suck<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.660> thumb<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.019> push

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
why can't you suck your thumb and push

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.709 
why can't you suck your thumb and push
your<00:00:37.350> teeth<00:00:37.530> back<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.239> newton's<00:00:39.239> law<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
your teeth back in newton's law of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.509 
your teeth back in newton's law of
physics<00:00:40.170> right<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.710> every<00:00:40.920> action<00:00:41.129> there's

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
physics right for every action there's

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.220 
physics right for every action there's
an<00:00:41.579> equal<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> opposite<00:00:42.390> reaction<00:00:42.449> so<00:00:44.420> um<00:00:45.420> as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
an equal and opposite reaction so um as

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
an equal and opposite reaction so um as
I<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.769> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.609> bit<00:00:47.760> older<00:00:47.999> and<00:00:48.449> start<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I got a little bit older and start to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.489 
I got a little bit older and start to
like<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.530> experimental<00:00:49.949> things<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.789> found<00:00:51.089> that

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
like on experimental things I found that

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.189 
like on experimental things I found that
once<00:00:52.499> your<00:00:52.859> body<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.239> sleep<00:00:54.420> sometimes

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
once your body goes to sleep sometimes

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
once your body goes to sleep sometimes
you<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> deep<00:00:56.429> sleep

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you know you're going that deep sleep

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.619 
you know you're going that deep sleep
and<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.210> called<00:00:57.449> REM<00:00:57.749> oh<00:00:58.069> well<00:00:59.069> um<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.969> REM

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and it's called REM oh well um in REM

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
and it's called REM oh well um in REM
mode<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.920> body<00:01:02.069> goes<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.819> this<00:01:03.269> mini

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
mode your body goes into like this mini

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.270 
mode your body goes into like this mini
a<00:01:03.719> coma<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.210> when<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.870> all<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.830> your

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
a coma and when it does that all of your

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
a coma and when it does that all of your
muscles<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.030> contract<00:01:10.040> including<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.190> gums

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
muscles do contract including your gums

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.320 
muscles do contract including your gums
and<00:01:12.290> when<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.410> does<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.430> loosens<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and when it does that it loosens the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.680 
and when it does that it loosens the
grip<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:17.580> gums<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.420> teeth

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
grip that your gums have on your teeth

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.150 
grip that your gums have on your teeth
that's<00:01:18.960> why<00:01:19.080> sometimes<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> wake<00:01:19.980> up

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
that's why sometimes when you wake up

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.400 
that's why sometimes when you wake up
you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.370> kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.790> grip<00:01:21.690> down<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.260> bite

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
you can kind of like grip down and bite

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.980 
you can kind of like grip down and bite
down<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.650> feel<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.760> teeth<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.240> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
down and feel like your teeth are just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
down and feel like your teeth are just
like<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.680> soggy<00:01:26.010> ish<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:27.090> lungs

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
like a little bit soggy ish your lungs

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.570 
like a little bit soggy ish your lungs
and<00:01:27.620> so<00:01:29.630> what<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.660> found<00:01:31.050> was<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.950> soon<00:01:32.250> as

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
and so what I found was that as soon as

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.150 
and so what I found was that as soon as
you<00:01:32.730> wake<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:33.150> there's<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> five<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.920> ten

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
you wake up there's like a five to ten

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.140 
you wake up there's like a five to ten
minute<00:01:35.460> window<00:01:35.990> from<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.490> gums<00:01:38.700> are

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
minute window from when your gums are

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
minute window from when your gums are
deep<00:01:39.840> interested<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:40.830> they<00:01:41.040> contract

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
deep interested to when they contract

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.560 
deep interested to when they contract
back<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.890> time

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
back up so in this time

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.050 
back up so in this time
I<00:01:44.630> define<00:01:45.170> something<00:01:45.620> that<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.490> can<00:01:46.670> use<00:01:46.880> to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
I define something that I can use to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.840 
I define something that I can use to
compress<00:01:47.510> against<00:01:47.870> my<00:01:48.050> teeth<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.850> manipulate

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
compress against my teeth to manipulate

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.820 
compress against my teeth to manipulate
the<00:01:50.000> shape<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:51.650> I<00:01:51.680> came<00:01:51.830> up<00:01:52.040> with<00:01:52.690> this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
the shape and so I came up with this

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.380 
the shape and so I came up with this
hard<00:01:54.830> enough<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.310> still<00:01:55.550> add<00:01:55.760> pressure<00:01:56.090> but

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
hard enough to still add pressure but

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.050 
hard enough to still add pressure but
it's<00:01:56.540> soft<00:01:56.840> enough<00:01:57.020> at<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.410> same<00:01:57.619> time<00:01:58.060> so

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's soft enough at the same time so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.310 
it's soft enough at the same time so
when<00:01:59.900> you<00:01:59.990> wake<00:02:00.200> up<00:02:00.470> in<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.979> morning<00:02:02.260> if<00:02:03.260> you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
when you wake up in the morning if you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.790 
when you wake up in the morning if you
live<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.000> top<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.540> bottom<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.080> just<00:02:06.619> like

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
live to the top and bottom and just like

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.880
