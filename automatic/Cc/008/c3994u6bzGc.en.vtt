00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.320 
obviously to make this and had an
awesome<00:01:52.540> idea<00:01:53.010> you'll<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.220> basically<00:01:54.940> on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
awesome idea you'll see basically on

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.510 
awesome idea you'll see basically on
these<00:01:55.540> levels<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.590> reach<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.070> concept

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
these levels you can reach the concept

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.950 
these levels you can reach the concept
of<00:01:57.670> reaching<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.240> star<00:01:58.480> in<00:01:58.630> different

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
of reaching the star in different

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.670 
of reaching the star in different
manners

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
manners

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.950 
manners
you<00:02:01.250> can<00:02:01.460> create<00:02:01.670> by<00:02:02.120> creating<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.570> line<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
you can create by creating a line you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080 
you can create by creating a line you
create<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.290> square<00:02:03.650> depending<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.430> how<00:02:04.670> thick

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
create a square depending on how thick

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.990 
create a square depending on how thick
the<00:02:05.240> line<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.980> square<00:02:07.280> creates<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:07.880> you

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the line is the square creates as you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.220 
the line is the square creates as you
can<00:02:08.149> see<00:02:08.270> here<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.880> I'm<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.210> basically<00:02:11.300> kind

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
can see here and I'm just basically kind

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.110 
can see here and I'm just basically kind
of<00:02:12.380> cheating<00:02:12.710> here<00:02:12.890> I'm<00:02:13.220> pushing<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> ball<00:02:13.850> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
of cheating here I'm pushing the ball to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.250 
of cheating here I'm pushing the ball to
reach<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> Stars<00:02:15.350> any<00:02:16.250> way<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.490> can<00:02:17.260> this

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
reach the Stars any way I can this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.440 
reach the Stars any way I can this
particular<00:02:18.440> level<00:02:19.400> right<00:02:19.550> here<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.880> really

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
particular level right here is a really

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.480 
particular level right here is a really
complicated<00:02:20.750> level<00:02:21.260> because<00:02:21.590> if<00:02:22.280> these

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
complicated level because if these

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.100 
complicated level because if these
things<00:02:22.520> start<00:02:23.030> spreading<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:23.870> really

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
things start spreading it's really

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.710 
things start spreading it's really
difficult<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.770> get<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.130> water<00:02:25.670> go<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
difficult to get the water go to the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.120 
difficult to get the water go to the
next<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.380> next<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.740> reach<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
next one and the next one and reach the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.750 
next one and the next one and reach the
start<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.740> I'm<00:02:30.740> showing<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.070> an<00:02:31.190> example<00:02:31.490> here

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
start so I'm showing you an example here

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.640 
start so I'm showing you an example here
what<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.300> hard<00:02:32.540> time<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.750> had<00:02:33.050> we're<00:02:33.380> trying<00:02:33.590> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
what a hard time I had we're trying to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.320 
what a hard time I had we're trying to
get<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.100> particular<00:02:35.410> level<00:02:36.410> past

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
get this particular level past

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330 
get this particular level past
I'm<00:02:38.720> sure<00:02:38.960> some<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.800> out<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:39.980> might

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
I'm sure some of you out there might

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.650 
I'm sure some of you out there might
make<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.850> easier<00:02:41.050> pass<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.230> whole<00:02:42.380> thing

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
make it easier pass the whole thing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
I had a hard time just getting these two

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.560 
I had a hard time just getting these two
things<00:02:46.300> online<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.830> could<00:02:48.070> make<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:49.240> bridge

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
things online so I could make a bridge

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.259 
things online so I could make a bridge
basically<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.880> ball<00:02:52.090> goes<00:02:52.330> across

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.899 

as<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.480> see<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.620> not<00:02:58.800> an<00:02:58.980> easy<00:02:59.069> task<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
as you can see it is not an easy task to

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.640 
as you can see it is not an easy task to
get<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.599> thing<00:03:00.659> going<00:03:00.989> because<00:03:01.409> once

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
get this thing going because once

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.930 
get this thing going because once
they're<00:03:01.769> spinning<00:03:02.099> their<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.549> spending

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
they're spinning their all spending

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.600 
they're spinning their all spending
different

simple<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.520> interesting<00:03:36.520> game

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.630 

you<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:40.710> all<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.950> shapes<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:41.430> create

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
you see all the shapes you can create

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.420 
you see all the shapes you can create
create<00:03:42.360> squares<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.050> believe<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.950> final

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
create squares I believe in the final

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.680 
create squares I believe in the final
version<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.940> they<00:03:45.090> make<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.510> you're

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
version that they make of this you're

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.030 
version that they make of this you're
going<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:45.990> able<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.230> create<00:03:46.350> all<00:03:46.680> kinds<00:03:46.710> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
going to be able to create all kinds of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.310 
going to be able to create all kinds of
shapes<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.580> know<00:03:47.700> circles<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.450> all<00:03:48.960> kinds<00:03:49.260> of

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
shapes you know circles and all kinds of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.160 
shapes you know circles and all kinds of
stuff<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:50.760> erase<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.630> shapes<00:03:51.840> all

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
stuff so to erase one of the shapes all

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.020 
stuff so to erase one of the shapes all
you<00:03:52.320> have<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.560> do<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.800> right-click<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:53.550> on<00:03:53.850> an

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you have to do is right-click on on an
