00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 well that's all if I'm a parent of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.830
 people come together for a pretty video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.970
 sympathetically times I hope you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.560
 go well because today we are 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.580
 found with a crazy mode that is the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.960
 bow points simply because 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.639
 I've never seen a fashion for you have 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 to tell you where there are so many 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 pigeons to be traced and as many xp to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 do it even though I'm master prestige 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 go ahead and test it I can assure you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.880
 that you are simply going to violate the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.810
 doubled the pigeon left a team 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.430
 because otherwise you're going 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.300
 get you raped so that's it then they 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.410
 did not tread that they did the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.939
 game mode since it's a qg to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 wholesale improve where his first quarters 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.310
 in the thing and who takes the points 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 besides small defect since all the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 world 30 for points and all the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.110
 world then breaks three quarters 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 time is that it's a little radishes 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.540
 we do not have to do it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 do not blame me for camping 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.920
 because I just play the goal 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 so that's all said but really 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 test this mode it's a crazy world at 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.539
 passage speaking of crazy if you're a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 crazy you can take a quick look 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's really fun 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520
 only if you feel like you strength 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.100
 not but it's still very very 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 pleasure so that's all is said excuse 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 me for this horrible toulon everything 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.949
 ugly and disgusting but 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.600
 simply the word studio is a horror 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 I can not see anything and today I 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 will not talk to you about the mode 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 for twenty years because otherwise we 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.309
 do not care a bit I want to talk 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 something else afterwards who will you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.970
 to please I think so that's all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.320
 is said I think I said everything lord 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.369
 points equal to the passage did not move 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.549
 no play with the rb7 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 excuse me here is the mp7 good she is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 not as powerful as shower 3 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.570
 since some people still tell me 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 Tchite not I still think that the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 mp7 and tchité besides we had more 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.420
 it live in j not see 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 masses about it so everything is said 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.150
 then their corner but I would not be 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.920
 with t-mobile srec is to make radish 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.509
 or not because frankly it's not 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.320
 my advice because if you play with 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 of big it would be that they were going 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.650
 have everyone buy so if he 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 mute and the microphone or a drone or especially 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.530
 a microphone with a small escort drone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.329
 I can assure you that you are going 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.740
 make coffee where mickey and micro a 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.150
 escort drone make sure you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 talked about price hordes hordes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.710
 for two minutes press 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.939
 gratos I mean the guys who 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.549
 can do nothing anymore so testis 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.110
 world with that a little basic smg2 without 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.219
 your the potato because here it is it is 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.360
 is still quite a project ago 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.979
 still a little close combat of the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.490
 contact sport I was going to say it's a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.710
 little this mode 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.060
 so here I am not for chantix you 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.079
 talk about the video and tell my life 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.549
 since everyone does not care about this 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.750
 boat if he wants a little bit I'll 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.220
 talk about something interesting because there 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.569
 it's just 11 am I 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.789
 come back from cinema ie there is a 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.929
 half hour I can tell you my life 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.780
 and I went to see a movie a movie of 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.040
 ouf as well say django so I'm 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.420
 not what they saw what he wanted 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.160
 we said oh damn it's a net or 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.769
 maybe a shit movie some 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.069
 did not like perso I loved it too much 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.660
 movie 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.040
 to drain I'm not used to doing the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 pub I'm going to do a little pub for a 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.099
 movie I never do those who do not 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.810
 are not seeing them this movie I you 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.280
 encourage him to see him so frankly you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.590
 do nothing instead of wanting to touch 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.269
 next weekend with family go there 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.620
 please alone the same family 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.750
 all alone it does not matter even because 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.250
 tintin was the kneecap without going to see this 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.049
 movie in itself the movie it does not take much 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 shit but fight against people 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.010
 frankly it's crazy stuff 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.660
 it's the django I do not know if he saw 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.760
 film when and 40 in coop 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 quentin tarantino excuse me I say a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.239
 little crap it goes to my penis 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.230
 language 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.250
 So here is really a crazy film 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.350
 he did a lot of this actor 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.239
 director did not really know this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 socialization did a lot of good 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.170
 movies really very good movies of which 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.549
 especially this one is really a 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.420
 crazy movie so maybe it's not 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.620
 the opinion of everyone since even 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.549
 Besides, one of my friends did not have 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.200
 all liked he told me it was shit 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.329
 I am not at all of this opinion because 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.590
 that I overcame myself went to see him there 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.970
 many clichés as clichés 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.680
 I want to say this movie is doing that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 almost clichés but hey it's a 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.440
 American movie good American movies 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.480
 we like the clichés since the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.560
 American movies 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.180
 here it is a little mac gyver in all 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.049
 the movies are the base otherwise you're not 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.079
 a true American hero 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.389
 it's a bit logical so here is everything 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.349
 case everything is said i'm sorry too from 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.090
 last week do not you in 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.770
 do you video I know just why 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.930
 because 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.880
 I do not have just phyto you 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.050
 propose because the studio mode in 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.870
 did they see they plant 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.100
 it's simple every time he murray that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.880
 I have no ranges no range pedret 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.930
 that she is much more than they would like 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.920
 that in fact it's simple we draw more 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.330
 generation of not even a 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.650
 to listen I will not offer you a 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
 index for sheep or a wine of 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.470
 profiteers too I had noticed a 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.420
 little trick in this part it's 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.100
 is called the party remington I you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.780
 explains is that in this game actually 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.920
 it's enough that for example you beat 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.810
 the team finally if you start with 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.190
 put a sheet and and the world all the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.240
 world is going out the remington this is the case 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.380
 in this part failed at the beginning of the game 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.910
 there was at heart and milton if you 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.720
 have been careful at the end of the game I'm 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.160
 am done to kill four five times 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.480
 in a row by remington though of 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.410
 that and that is valid in all 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.690
 game modes I do not know if 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.160
 by the way you approve it tell me if 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.900
 you have frankly if you find that 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.920
 the group because the air mine when 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.000
 I really see more and more 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.260
 every time we kill them I have nothing 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.370
 against this weapon but I find that 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.510
 really see a lot of Japan that we 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 kill them people maybe they 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.810
 wish to shotgun for the time 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.990
 I do not know at all so I do not know 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.330
 so two points early so that's it 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.320
 it's said in passing I know it 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.750
 interested some I could you 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.280
 make a moon of may one a video of 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.870
 my classes simply do a 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.580
 video of my classes to offer you 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.520
 only if you feel like it says 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.420
 me everything then in passing this game mode 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.010
 if they give you a little advice 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.780
 go ahead especially a team even if 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.310
 I insist very little appart on 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.180
 go back a bit on the stuff whatever they 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.440
 stop telling my life 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.390
 but do not hesitate to re django when 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.650
 even speak frankly it's really worth 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.370
 the shot is a crazy line mode 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.250
 So here is 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
 but this mode also to speak a little bit of 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.360
 shit this vote to come back 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.650
 just this mode do not go all 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.790
 only one site really just wrong 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.050
 it's an objective mode is not everything 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.389
 only because you are really going to do 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.250
 violate but purple in every sense of the 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.050
 term because often in public the 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.040
 guys with who you are and I'll 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.030
 put this game mode they come that 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840
 for the points actually because since 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.070
 it is the first who takes the points 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.229
 that's all world breaks after so 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.860
 nobody plays goals online asia 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.240
 with colleagues 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.699
 if you are only two or three aisles 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.810
 basically it's called an impact by 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.160
 elsewhere does a multi team that's what 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.530
 I was there at the time were only 3 of 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.760
 matty of a month of the blow between there and we 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.419
 fell on that and here they could
