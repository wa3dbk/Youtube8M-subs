 belmont published as always by 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 konami had criticisms much lower than 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 those of the excellent among previous that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 had left in 2010 the thing was complicated 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 last Thursday when a member of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 the forums of a Spanish gaming site 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 claiming to be a studio employee 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 mercurysteam stated that its creators 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.710
 They knew perfectly well that criticism 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
 they were going to be terrible because the process of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 I develop an absolute chaos this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 anonymous employee who had been filtering 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 news about mercurysteam some time ago 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.680
 blame the head of the enric studio 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 álvarez who describes as a man 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.090
 miserly arrogant proud owner 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 Excessive business and apart is capricious 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 it sounds like the worst boss in the world and it's true 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 that during the development of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 castlevania lords of shadow ' 2 several 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.610
 employees resigned according to the anonymous 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.010
 tired of Álvarez's personality and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.840
 of the meager salaries received the blow 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.730
 killer in these statements is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.400
 He referred to the presence of hideo kojima 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.260
 creator of metal gear that supposedly 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.150
 had supervised the development of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.340
 new castlevania and that according to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 anonymous employee only visited one 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.090
 later he signed some papers he took some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.160
 photos and returned to Japanese 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 now you have to see that he responds with 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.110
 friends the planetary file the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 damn nerds we love science fiction 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.220
 more than any other gender is the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.650
 heroic fantasy of star wars or the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 cynical future of blade runner but what 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.100
 only that we like more of our 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 Favorite penalties is to know what happens 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 behind scenes and thanks to the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.790

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.100

 years star love was one of the first 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.130
 magazines for fans of the genre of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.360
 the us that from 1976 to 2009 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.800
 registered the big productions to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.110
 through interviews with its creators 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.060
 photos of the sets and conceptual art 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.040
 the owners of the magazine scanned the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.510
 more than 300 numbers and donated the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.790

 to the launch of star wars of the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.930

 freedom this treasure of science 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.040
 fiction the most square movie the movie 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.810
 de brun may have been very bad but 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.970
 there is no denying that the game lends itself 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.379
 to a film adaptation what 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.209
 same goes with the recent milk for 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.430
 speed since the post of the series has 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.989
 much of 'fast and furious' there are fichines 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 that seem made to become 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.849
 movies but minecraft is definitely not 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.829
 one of them however the huge 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.959
 popularity of the game among children of 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.659
 worldwide and the recent success of the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.370
 lego movie convinced warner of 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.620
 start the production of the great 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.329
 movie of minecraft and not even the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.960
 that we lost now with this game of 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.300
 exploration 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.940
 Pixelated Cubes and Fluid Green Zombies 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.520
 we have an idea that maybe we can 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440
 get to deal with we will get the doubt in 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.430
 a couple of years alone in theaters and 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.360

 vorterix rock in connection with vorterix 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.560
 dotcom the misfits will inherit the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.150
