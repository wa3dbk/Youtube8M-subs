00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.240
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.060
 day and preto we are in a new news 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.070
 important between xbox one in playstation 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.099
 4 and is that the web page 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.230
 GarzÃ³n Point is specialized in making 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 analysis and review all the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.949
 characteristics of all the elements 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.870
 of almost everything from fish consoles to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 all well then 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.610
 this time he has said has made a 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.330
 article where it says that the processor 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.010
 xbox wii xbox one is slower than the one in 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.230
 the playstation 4 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.280
 The truth is that many have talked about 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.350
 the topic after seeing the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 technical characteristics especially for 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.240
 the ram that they use you already know 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.930
 what equipment does gddr3 use? 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.740
 playstation 4 uses gddr5 which is more 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.360
 more powerful modern as they say and between 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.980
 they would be post and you do not know 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.440
 that the playstation 4 processor is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.080
 announced in February combines a chip 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.690
 jaguar of 8 cores operating at 1.6 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 gigahertz to compare let's say 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.730
 that the one on the xbox one uses the same 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 jaguar processor from 8 kos to 1.6 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.540
 gigahertz 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.750
 but according to the article says his gpu is 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.350
 quite inferior since it has 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.360
 768 streams processes and 8 gigas of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.090
 memory ddr3 to 2.133 megahertz you have to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.520
 say that playstation 4 would use 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 a gpu radeon that has 1,156 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.750
 string processes 32 rops and 8 gb with 256 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.500
 bits of bandwidth all this with a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.170
 gddr5 memory that works at 5.5 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700
 effective gigahertz the truth is that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.329
 all the features I do not want you 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.340
 dizzy 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.420
 is the whole article is very good 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.109
 Article 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.200
 here they dare to say that both 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.530
 consoles will arrive graphics with graphics 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.750
 core next dares to say that it has 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.920
 the graphs of this type what of the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.319
 graphic cards that carry 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.620
 consoles I have not told you anything at all 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.090
 it is speculated it is speculated that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.390
 possibly in the xbox one by 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 comparison carry about 7,600 70 and the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.470
 playstation3 about 7 thousand 850 but that's 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 speculate a lot 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.740
 I already say a lot, I want you to be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.410
 you comment to me look at the article and the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.330
 that you really understand about this type of 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.150
 computing everything that has to do 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
 with this I said about it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 I really think that the two consoles 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.030
 the games will be very even 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.650
 exclusive of each console to be 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.930
 juegoszos with some graphics 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.230
 awesome and it's going to happen like this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.210
 generation not that the xbox will look very 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.520
 very very very well and even up to 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.160
 final and playstation 4 because it has 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.520
 very powerful games like uncharted 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.500
 god of war and good to call more 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.960
 attention for example uncharted and 'heavy 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.030
 rain 'that are games that stand out 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.670
 on top of the rest no and now the most 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.790
 recent the last of us that really goes 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.880
 to be a pass and killzone are not 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.130
 games that are worth playing and that 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.410
 they are where they show a place in 4 their 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.560
 potential respect for other games 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.930
 they perform just as you know they are very equal 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.240
 and the xbox as it has its games we 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 goose and software that are great games 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.170
 graphically impressive the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.299
 they are a pass and everyone has their 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.360
 games so you'll just have to choose 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.360
 and play that's good until the next
