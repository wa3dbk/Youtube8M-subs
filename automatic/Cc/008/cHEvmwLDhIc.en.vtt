00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.549
 greeting in this video wanna talk 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.180
 about adaptations of which not much 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.559
 it happens 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.960
 it clamps and tell and show 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 homemade clamp design 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.640
 which is pretty common but 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.920
 Some changes have been made here. 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 which allow her to improve and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 so the design is such a clamp but 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.830
 far from new then surely if 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.920
 you wondered already 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.920
 found something similar done on 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.960
 fixed basque 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 allows and the second line allows 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:21.020
 so marina fixed only by 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 There are pretty comfortable clamps 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 glue the details of furniture board with us 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.149
 glue and physically using data 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.079
 besides the fact that this clamp can 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.549
 very good to use for bonding 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.820
 small accounts 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.490
 they can also be used for assembly 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.649
 furniture doors and here is just from here 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.900
 this lateral syllable syllables i'm not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:11.050
 last role in particular per hour 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.440
 door is made and connecting two clamps 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.340
 here it is on the one hand tightened 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.240
 there will be a lot out in the middle and what 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.240
 due to lateral 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.080
 these holes and clamps are connected 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.980
 between themselves 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 this way for large enough 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.860
 constructions 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.770
 can be used 1 to 2 clamps 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.240
 just combining them in order 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.300
 some wide long things 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:52.510
 we collect in the basis of this clamp 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:56.570
 used my juice is 30 by 45 managers you 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:03.020
 you will not be long at the same time 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:07.090
 such a running mode is also 65 minus 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.940
 millimeters and when they come together 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.530
 given instructions but it turns out in this 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.780
 case i have two holes stuff 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:24.730
 hooked and the total length they 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 now 960 with these millimeters 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:34.130
 as if to a meter because with one trace 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.959
 hook once and can pull 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.430
 for the assembly I think it is quite 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.430
 enough for some furniture details 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.300
 at this all today use
