00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.590 
like I said this is a wider line you can
do<00:02:49.900> more<00:02:50.530> narrow<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> other<00:02:52.480> side

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
do more narrow is that on the other side

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.980 
do more narrow is that on the other side
I<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.730> something<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.820> show<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.420> that
