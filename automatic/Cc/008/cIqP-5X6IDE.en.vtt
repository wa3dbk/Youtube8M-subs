unusual<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.439> sounds<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.340> was

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
unusual as that sounds it was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
unusual as that sounds it was
fascinating<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> ron

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
fascinating it really was and and ron

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
fascinating it really was and and ron
was<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.340> rodman<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.180> mean<00:01:12.210> he<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:12.840> did

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
present himself in a way that I think

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
I thought he handled it pretty well I I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.289

the video quotes at the time which

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.840 
the video quotes at the time which
colored<00:01:36.180> my<00:01:36.390> view<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.229> kim<00:01:37.740> jong<00:01:38.250> hoon

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
colored my view which was kim jong hoon

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.840

is<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> cool<00:01:39.930> guy<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.530> his<00:01:40.770> father<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
is a cool guy in his father and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
is a cool guy in his father and
grandfather<00:01:41.939> were<00:01:42.509> great<00:01:42.840> men<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.320> something

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
grandfather were great men or something

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460 
grandfather were great men or something
like<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.759> thought<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.570> might<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like that and I I thought that might I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.969 
like that and I I thought that might I
would<00:01:46.950> charitably<00:01:47.759> call<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.329> misguided<00:01:48.979> but

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
would charitably call that misguided but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
would charitably call that misguided but
on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> other<00:01:50.579> hand<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.180> he<00:01:52.140> may<00:01:52.350> have

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
on the other hand I think he may have

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.609 
on the other hand I think he may have
done<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.200> turns<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
done something that so turns out to be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
done something that so turns out to be
more<00:01:56.280> positive<00:01:56.490> than<00:01:56.880> negative<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.750> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
more positive than negative and that of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.979 
more positive than negative and that of
course<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.290> would<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> good<00:01:58.770> thing
