multiply 5 by an even

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.040 
multiply 5 by an even
you<00:01:58.490> got<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> Glyndon<00:01:59.300> zero<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.870> if<00:01:59.930> you

you got a Glyndon zero and if you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.870 
you got a Glyndon zero and if you
multiply<00:02:00.230> five<00:02:00.860> by<00:02:00.890> an<00:02:01.160> odd<00:02:01.340> number<00:02:01.730> your
