 of occupying powder to bake a milkmaid 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.879
 in this case I'm going to use this one that is 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.139
 of candy and I will also use a 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.079

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:47.539
 this presentation of dark we are going to 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.699
 take a little salt let's start to 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.260
 deliver all the ingredients the average 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:57.070
 cream the 7 eggs two cans of corn and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.250
 right away I'm going to liquefy everything 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.180
 after it has liquefied mixture in a 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.060
 vessel I'm going to put the flour one 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.550
 teaspoon vanilla two tablespoons 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.170

 I will also use a bar 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.450
 113 grams butter is the turn of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.720
 the milk to this case from caramel or 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.540

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 spoonful of ground salt after I go to

 Incorporate the right mixture 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.800
 before and I will be beating 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.810
 little by little moving my mold and I'm going to 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.390
 be doing little by little mixing 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.150
 so that it is incorporated better 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.650
 now it helps the mixer if those 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.480
 People who are looking for candy 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.230
 I recommend that you place a milk 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.810
 condensed smaller this will give you a 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.840
 touch sweeter clear this is optional 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.230
 if I'm going to put 5 tablespoons of 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.270
 sugar or half butter bar 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.970
 then I'm going to put it in the oven for 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.980
 a few minutes if you have microwave what 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.290
 you can do for a minute in this case 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.440
 I do not have that why I do it so oil my 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.810
 mold perfectly I will place them 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.670
 a can of corn 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.580
 And finally I'm going to empty my mix 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.250
 covering all my corn and with the help 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.550
 from a little stick 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.520

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.750
