Cage<00:01:12.060> plays<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.600> those<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:12.959> even<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.410> that

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
Cage plays with those but even now that

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440 
Cage plays with those but even now that
they<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.399> kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> urban<00:01:15.119> more

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
they have these this kind of urban more

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.419 
they have these this kind of urban more
modern<00:01:16.080> Street<00:01:16.319> version<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.709> Luke<00:01:16.860> Cage<00:01:17.039> that

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
modern Street version of Luke Cage that

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.150 
modern Street version of Luke Cage that
doesn't<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:17.850> appeal<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.209> me<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.160> and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
doesn't really appeal to me so much and

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.589 
doesn't really appeal to me so much and
that's<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> trappings<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:21.599 
that's because the trappings of the

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.169 
that's because the trappings of the
stereotypes<00:01:22.289> are<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.619> problematic<00:01:22.940> means<00:01:23.940> a

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
stereotypes are so problematic means a

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:25.880 
stereotypes are so problematic means a
prison<00:01:24.660> guy<00:01:24.929> I<00:01:24.959> mean<00:01:25.259> wrongfully<00:01:25.800> imprisoned

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
prison guy I mean wrongfully imprisoned

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.400 
prison guy I mean wrongfully imprisoned
was<00:01:26.280> still<00:01:26.459> in<00:01:26.610> prison<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.289> experimented<00:01:28.289> on

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
was still in prison and experimented on

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.600 
was still in prison and experimented on
but<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.679> don't<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.099> wrestle<00:01:29.429> with<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but they don't really wrestle with the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
but they don't really wrestle with the
whole<00:01:29.759> Tuskegee<00:01:30.209> Experiment<00:01:30.959> nature<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.979> his

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
whole Tuskegee Experiment nature of his

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.419 
whole Tuskegee Experiment nature of his
emergence<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.179> a<00:01:33.240> superhero<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:35.039> so<00:01:35.190> those

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
emergence as a superhero and so those

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.190 
emergence as a superhero and so those
things<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.060> never<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.750> outside

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
things we never really get outside

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.169 
things we never really get outside
outside<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.729> felt<00:01:39.119> like

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
outside of that and so I felt like

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.699 
outside of that and so I felt like
Carrick's<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.840> Luke<00:01:39.990> Cage<00:01:40.170> tend<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.679> a

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
Carrick's like Luke Cage tend to be a

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.859 
Carrick's like Luke Cage tend to be a
little<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.099> limited<00:01:41.580> now<00:01:41.940> however<00:01:42.119> Black

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
little bit limited now however Black

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.809 
little bit limited now however Black
Panther<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.289> little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.649> different<00:01:44.099> I'm

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:48.239 
somehow in Jack Kirby's imagination he

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.270 
somehow in Jack Kirby's imagination he
has<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> those<00:01:49.140> reductive<00:01:49.739> qualities

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
has some of those reductive qualities

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.210 
has some of those reductive qualities
but<00:01:50.910> his<00:01:51.090> sense<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.750> place<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.200> geography<00:01:53.069> with
