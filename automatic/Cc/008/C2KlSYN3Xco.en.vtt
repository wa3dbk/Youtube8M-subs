00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
it I really haven't been looking up any

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.960 
it I really haven't been looking up any
information<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.560> new<00:01:09.680> town<00:01:09.890> one<00:01:10.490> experience

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
information on new town one experience

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.700 
information on new town one experience
at<00:01:11.060> first<00:01:11.240> firsthand<00:01:11.810> obviously<00:01:12.410> we<00:01:12.530> have<00:01:12.620> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
at first firsthand obviously we have the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.250 
at first firsthand obviously we have the
population<00:01:12.920> counter<00:01:13.700> which<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.660> down<00:01:14.840> zero

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
population counter which is down zero

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.910 
population counter which is down zero
and<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:16.700> think<00:01:17.210> that's<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.930> talked<00:01:18.620> about<00:01:18.650> that

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
and I think that's I talked about that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.970 
and I think that's I talked about that
when<00:01:19.370> my<00:01:19.730> initial<00:01:20.060> playthrough<00:01:20.500> was<00:01:21.500> goes<00:01:21.860> up

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
when my initial playthrough was goes up

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.530 
when my initial playthrough was goes up
to<00:01:22.070> 99<00:01:22.400> starts<00:01:22.730> counting<00:01:22.880> down<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.210> zero<00:01:23.420> again

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
to 99 starts counting down to zero again

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.960 
to 99 starts counting down to zero again
and<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.260> have<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.530> clock<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:24.830> clock<00:01:25.370> when

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and we have that clock that clock when

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.230 
and we have that clock that clock when
it<00:01:26.060> gets<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.360> zero<00:01:26.390> that's<00:01:26.990> uh<00:01:27.700> at<00:01:28.700> least<00:01:28.760> I

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
it gets to zero that's uh at least I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.900 
it gets to zero that's uh at least I
think<00:01:29.330> that's<00:01:29.960> when<00:01:30.350> we've<00:01:30.710> been<00:01:30.980> getting<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
think that's when we've been getting the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.500 
think that's when we've been getting the
perks<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.460> pack<00:01:34.880> punch<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
perks and the and the pack punch and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.300 
perks and the and the pack punch and
it's<00:01:35.720> randomized<00:01:36.350> it's<00:01:36.650> randomized<00:01:37.040> because

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
it's randomized it's randomized because

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.830 
it's randomized it's randomized because
in<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.520> game<00:01:37.730> that<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:37.910> was<00:01:37.970> playing<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:38.450> didn't

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
in this game that I was playing I didn't

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.290 
in this game that I was playing I didn't
get<00:01:38.930> jug<00:01:39.230> to<00:01:39.470> like<00:01:39.620> round<00:01:40.010> 15<00:01:40.700> or<00:01:40.970> someone<00:01:41.270> that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
get jug to like round 15 or someone that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.630 
get jug to like round 15 or someone that
was<00:01:41.570> ridiculous<00:01:42.350> there<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:43.160> go<00:01:43.250> 15<00:01:43.610> rounds

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
was ridiculous there we go 15 rounds

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.010 
was ridiculous there we go 15 rounds
with<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.150> jug<00:01:44.420> who<00:01:44.660> does<00:01:44.870> that<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:46.600> guess<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.780> did

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
with a jug who does that I guess I did

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.810 
with a jug who does that I guess I did
no<00:01:48.470> I'm<00:01:48.920> not<00:01:49.070> posting<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.520> whole<00:01:49.640> gameplay

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
anyways so we're gonna take a look and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.620 
anyways so we're gonna take a look and
that<00:01:51.950> round<00:01:52.190> starting<00:01:52.940> around<00:01:53.030> three<00:01:53.390> ending

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that round starting around three ending

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.720 
that round starting around three ending
around<00:01:53.720> two<00:01:54.050> I'm<00:01:54.950> gonna<00:01:55.070> skip<00:01:55.310> forward<00:01:55.610> to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
around two I'm gonna skip forward to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.720 
around two I'm gonna skip forward to
that<00:01:55.910> is<00:01:56.120> when<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.260> hear<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.680> first<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:58.220> what

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
that is when we hear the first of what

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.970 
that is when we hear the first of what
is<00:01:58.850> going<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.300> come<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.570> be<00:01:59.690> possibly<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
is going to come to be possibly and a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:15.880 
is going to come to be possibly and a
bit<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.310> storyline

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.350 

all<00:02:16.890> right<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.610> first<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.120> hear

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
all right so that's the first we hear

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.420 
all right so that's the first we hear
Richthofen<00:02:19.019> if<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> notice<00:02:19.650> these<00:02:19.920> zombie

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
Richthofen if you notice these zombie

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.050 
Richthofen if you notice these zombie
eyes<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.660> blue<00:02:22.380> they're<00:02:22.880> yellow<00:02:23.880> or

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
eyes are and not blue they're yellow or

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.370 
eyes are and not blue they're yellow or
orange<00:02:24.090> ish<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.660> whatever<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> call

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
orange ish or whatever you want to call

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.210 
orange ish or whatever you want to call
it<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.940> presumably<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.080> Samantha<00:02:28.950> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it so presumably here that Samantha is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
it so presumably here that Samantha is
still<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.760> control<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> zombies<00:02:30.599> which

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
still in control of the zombies which

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.920 
still in control of the zombies which
leads<00:02:31.800> us<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> believe<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.459> our<00:02:33.269> time<00:02:33.300> frame

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
leads us to believe that our time frame

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.479 
leads us to believe that our time frame
is<00:02:34.260> before<00:02:34.920> transit<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:37.080> again<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.250> see

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
is before transit and again we will see

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.420 
is before transit and again we will see
more<00:02:38.730> evidence<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.360> what's<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.049> come<00:02:40.160> later<00:02:41.160> on

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
more evidence of what's to come later on

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.570 
more evidence of what's to come later on
but<00:02:41.880> yeah<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.230> new<00:02:43.560> town<00:02:43.860> we've<00:02:44.370> already

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
but yeah so a new town we've already

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.350 
but yeah so a new town we've already
done<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.420> teddy<00:02:46.049> bear<00:02:46.230> Easter<00:02:46.680> eggs<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
done the teddy bear Easter eggs the the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.990 
done the teddy bear Easter eggs the the
songs<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:49.590> well<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.430> mannequin<00:02:50.790> heads

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
songs as well as the the mannequin heads

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.940 
songs as well as the the mannequin heads
but<00:02:51.750> I'm<00:02:51.989> really<00:02:52.200> interested<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
but I'm really interested in the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.580 
but I'm really interested in the
storyline<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:54.299> think<00:02:54.780> there<00:02:54.930> may<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.110> some

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
storyline and I think there may be some

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.370 
storyline and I think there may be some
people<00:02:56.459> some<00:02:56.970> other<00:02:57.060> people<00:02:57.510> perhaps<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:58.230> this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
people some other people perhaps on this

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.710 
people some other people perhaps on this

map somewhere that we're going to find
