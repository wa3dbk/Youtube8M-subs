00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
when you're using them in your slider as

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.399 
when you're using them in your slider as
the<00:01:00.620> bigger<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.760> images<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.569> more<00:01:03.019> room<00:01:03.260> or

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
them son there so already on my project

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.260 
them son there so already on my project
set<00:01:09.470> up<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:10.070> a<00:01:10.280> simple<00:01:10.670> single<00:01:11.119> View

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
set up it's a simple single View

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.819 
set up it's a simple single View
application<00:01:11.299> for<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.140> iPhone<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.740> I've

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
application for the iPhone and I've

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.950 
application for the iPhone and I've
simple<00:01:13.219> named<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.579> custom<00:01:14.329> slider<00:01:14.600> for<00:01:14.899> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
simple named it custom slider for the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.740 
simple named it custom slider for the
purpose<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.469> this<00:01:15.530> tutorial<00:01:16.450> now<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.509> first

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
purpose of this tutorial now the first

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.779 
purpose of this tutorial now the first
thing<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:17.990> want<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.170> do<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.649> drag<00:01:19.130> our<00:01:19.369> images

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
thing we want to do is drag our images

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.770 
thing we want to do is drag our images
and<00:01:19.969> import<00:01:20.630> them<00:01:20.780> into<00:01:20.810> our<00:01:21.200> project<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:23.659> we

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
and import them into our project so we

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.580 
and import them into our project so we
just<00:01:23.899> grab<00:01:24.140> them<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:26.229> drag<00:01:27.229> them<00:01:27.289> into<00:01:27.500> our

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
just grab them and drag them into our

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.819 
just grab them and drag them into our
project<00:01:28.009> here<00:01:28.930> make<00:01:29.930> sure<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.229> select<00:01:30.409> cost

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
project here make sure you select cost

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.099 
project here make sure you select cost
copy<00:01:31.430> items<00:01:31.729> into<00:01:32.210> destinations<00:01:32.869> group

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
copy items into destinations group

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.090 
copy items into destinations group
folder<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.159> then<00:01:35.229> once<00:01:36.229> you've<00:01:36.350> let<00:01:36.679> me<00:01:36.829> go

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
folder and then once you've let me go

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.609 
folder and then once you've let me go
into<00:01:37.219> our<00:01:37.429> viewcontroller<00:01:37.759> h<00:01:38.509> where<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:39.469> need

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
into our viewcontroller h where we need

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.169 
into our viewcontroller h where we need
to<00:01:39.740> add<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.920> iboutlet<00:01:40.670> for<00:01:41.600> our<00:01:41.780> slider<00:01:43.179> so

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
to add the iboutlet for our slider so

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.630 
to add the iboutlet for our slider so
just<00:01:44.479> after<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.780> UI<00:01:44.899> view<00:01:45.140> controller<00:01:45.549> we<00:01:46.549> do

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
just after the UI view controller we do

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.569 
just after the UI view controller we do
a<00:01:46.700> bracket<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.179> press<00:01:47.240> ENTER<00:01:47.659> twice<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.460> I've

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
a bracket and press ENTER twice so I've

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.139 
a bracket and press ENTER twice so I've
been<00:01:49.789> iboutlet<00:01:52.179> space<00:01:53.179> you<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> slider<00:01:55.149> and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
been iboutlet space you are a slider and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.109 
been iboutlet space you are a slider and
I<00:01:56.240> simply<00:01:56.689> name<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.109> slider<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:58.969> really

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
I simply name it slider so it's really

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.639 
I simply name it slider so it's really
easy<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.570> understand<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:00.289> come<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
easy to understand and we come to the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.010 
easy to understand and we come to the
coding<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:01.880> can<00:02:01.969> say<00:02:02.329> that<00:02:02.359> I'm<00:02:02.749> going<00:02:02.929> to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
coding so we can say that I'm going to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.889 
coding so we can say that I'm going to
our<00:02:03.200> view<00:02:03.499> controller<00:02:03.950> dart<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.899> just

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
our view controller dart in and just

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.599 
our view controller dart in and just
have<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.289> implementation<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.249> the<00:02:07.399> view

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
have to do implementation of the view

go to add the image for our minimum so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.369 
go to add the image for our minimum so
