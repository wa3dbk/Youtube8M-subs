out<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:00.900> all<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.110> peg<00:00:01.290> grinds<00:00:01.560> that<00:00:01.770> I'm<00:00:01.829> going

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
out of all the peg grinds that I'm going

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.919 
out of all the peg grinds that I'm going
to<00:00:02.010> teach<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.220> today<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:03.240> ice<00:00:03.360> pick<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.780> my

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
to teach you today the ice pick is my

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.220 
to teach you today the ice pick is my
personal<00:00:04.170> favorite<00:00:04.759> it<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.450> grind<00:00:07.080> that

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
personal favorite it is a grind that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.509 
personal favorite it is a grind that
involves<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.680> whole<00:00:07.830> lot<00:00:07.980> more<00:00:08.099> balanced<00:00:08.460> than

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
involves a whole lot more balanced than

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.650 
involves a whole lot more balanced than
the<00:00:08.670> other<00:00:08.790> ones<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.179> we've<00:00:09.269> talked<00:00:09.510> about

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
the other ones that we've talked about

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.020 
the other ones that we've talked about
because<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.679> grind<00:00:11.040> only<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.730> your<00:00:11.880> back

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
because it's a grind only on your back

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.999 
because it's a grind only on your back
peg<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:12.929> front<00:00:13.080> wheel<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
peg with your front wheel up so

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.530 
peg with your front wheel up so
essentially<00:00:14.639> you're<00:00:14.730> balancing<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.330> back

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
essentially you're balancing on the back

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.480 
essentially you're balancing on the back
peg<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.960> sort<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> manual<00:00:16.710> actually

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
peg it's sort of like a manual actually

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.490 
peg it's sort of like a manual actually
except<00:00:18.270> instead<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> rolling<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.350> back

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
except instead of rolling on your back

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.849 
except instead of rolling on your back
wheel<00:00:19.710> you're<00:00:20.279> sliding<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.150> your<00:00:21.270> back<00:00:21.420> peg

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
wheel you're sliding on your back peg

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.970 
wheel you're sliding on your back peg
it's<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> those<00:00:23.220> tricks<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.740> you<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it's one of those tricks that is you you

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
it's one of those tricks that is you you
really<00:00:26.130> need<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
really need to know what it is that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.609 
really need to know what it is that
you're<00:00:27.510> grinding<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.470> gauge

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you're grinding on so that you can gauge

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.109 
you're grinding on so that you can gauge
your<00:00:28.650> speed<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.130> figure<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.910> body

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
your speed and figure out your body

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.910 
your speed and figure out your body
position<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> grinding

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
position because if you're grinding

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
position because if you're grinding
something<00:00:32.250> that's<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.790> slick<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.840> don't

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
something that's really slick you don't

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.540 
something that's really slick you don't
want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.469> too<00:00:34.649> far<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.399> you'll

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
want to be too far back because you'll

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
want to be too far back because you'll
loop<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.239> easily<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.899> your

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
loop out really easily you want your

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
loop out really easily you want your
front<00:00:37.200> end<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.770> low<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
front end to be really low but at the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.190 
front end to be really low but at the
same<00:00:39.090> time<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.600> grinding<00:00:39.840> something

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
same time if you're grinding something

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
same time if you're grinding something
you<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.860> unwashed<00:00:41.340> cement<00:00:42.120> ledge

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you know like an unwashed cement ledge

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
you know like an unwashed cement ledge
you<00:00:43.110> want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.469> sure<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.040> you're

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you want to make sure that you're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.220 
you want to make sure that you're
farther<00:00:44.399> back<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.930> hit<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
farther back because as as you hit it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.479 
farther back because as as you hit it
and<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> decelerate<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.070> front<00:00:47.309> ends

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and you decelerate your front ends

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.690 
and you decelerate your front ends
naturally<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> drop<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
naturally going to want to drop the you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
naturally going to want to drop the you
know<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.660> tricks<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
know it's it's one of those tricks that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
know it's it's one of those tricks that
this<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.579> other<00:00:53.670> grinds<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
this one more than the other grinds that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
this one more than the other grinds that
we've<00:00:54.329> talked<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.410> takes<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.800> lot<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we've talked about really takes a lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.160 
we've talked about really takes a lot of
practice<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.050> it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
practice you're going you know it's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
practice you're going you know it's
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.640> take<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.789> probably<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.480> know

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
going to take take you probably you know

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.970 
going to take take you probably you know
a<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:00.750> couple<00:01:00.989> weeks<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.559> before<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
a good couple weeks or so before you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
a good couple weeks or so before you
really<00:01:02.250> start<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.550> figure<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.780> balance

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
really start to figure out the balance

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
really start to figure out the balance
point<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.729> more<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> balance

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
point and more than just the balance

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.859 
point and more than just the balance
point<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> balance<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.369> grind<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:09.689> best

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
point how to balance in a grind the best

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
point how to balance in a grind the best
thing<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> found<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.159> learning<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thing that I found for learning how to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
thing that I found for learning how to
use<00:01:11.729> ice<00:01:12.030> pick<00:01:12.240> rinds<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> nice<00:01:12.990> relatively

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
use ice pick rinds is a nice relatively

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
use ice pick rinds is a nice relatively
low<00:01:14.000> grind<00:01:15.000> box<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.509> 12<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.930> 14<00:01:16.049> inches

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
low grind box you know 12 or 14 inches

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
low grind box you know 12 or 14 inches
high<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> wax<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.270> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
high with a good bit of wax on it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
high with a good bit of wax on it
because<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.680> allows<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> focus<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
because it allows you to focus more on

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.950 
because it allows you to focus more on
your<00:01:22.140> balance<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.240> pumping<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.750> legs

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
your balance and pumping with your legs

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
your balance and pumping with your legs
like<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> would<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.890> manual<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.460> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
like you would in a manual so that you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.160 
like you would in a manual so that you
can<00:01:26.759> maintain<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.210> balance<00:01:27.420> point<00:01:27.840> for

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
can maintain that balance point for

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
can maintain that balance point for
longer<00:01:28.409> distances<00:01:28.610> once<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
longer distances once you get all that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
longer distances once you get all that
figured<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.840> apply<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.290> those

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
figured out you can apply all those

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
figured out you can apply all those
skills<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> you've<00:01:31.979> already<00:01:32.159> learned<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
skills that you've already learned to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
skills that you've already learned to
grinding<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.020> sorts<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> different<00:01:34.530> objects

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
grinding all sorts of different objects

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.240 
grinding all sorts of different objects
and<00:01:35.720> but<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.259> time<00:01:37.409> having<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> good

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and but at the same time having a good

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
and but at the same time having a good
foundation<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.810> figured<00:01:39.960> out

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
foundation where you have figured out

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.749 
foundation where you have figured out
your<00:01:40.320> balance<00:01:40.650> points<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.189> figured<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.579> how

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
your balance points you figured out how

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
your balance points you figured out how
to<00:01:41.820> maintain<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.140> balance<00:01:43.560> that's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to maintain that that balance that's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.590 
to maintain that that balance that's
going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.729> important<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> being

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
going to be really important to being

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.550 
going to be really important to being
able<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.860> other<00:01:47.100> objects<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
able to take this to other objects so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960 
able to take this to other objects so
the<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.860> main<00:01:50.040> thing<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the the main thing with this is that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
the the main thing with this is that
you're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.500> pick<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.130> not

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
you're going to want to to pick up not

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.090 
you're going to want to to pick up not
too<00:01:53.610> high<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.259> grind

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
too high as you know as with any grind

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
too high as you know as with any grind
trick<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> put<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.479> back<00:01:57.630> wheel<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
trick and put your back wheel down on

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
trick and put your back wheel down on
the<00:01:58.829> ledge<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.310> rail<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.299> whatever<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.780> that

the ledge or rail or whatever it is that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
the ledge or rail or whatever it is that
you're<00:02:01.020> grinding<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> don't<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> too

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you're grinding but you don't do it too

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
you're grinding but you don't do it too
hard<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:03.899> hard

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hard because if you do it really hard

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
hard because if you do it really hard
that<00:02:04.380> will<00:02:04.469> force<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.829> front<00:02:05.070> end<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
as you you know a lot like a manual

gentle hop kind of like a like you're
hopping<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.950> manual<00:02:21.370> we'll<00:02:21.970> get<00:02:22.090> you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
hopping out of a manual we'll get you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.180 
hopping out of a manual we'll get you
right<00:02:22.390> off<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.570> whatever<00:02:22.870> you're<00:02:23.110> driving<00:02:23.530> so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
right off of whatever you're driving so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.820 
right off of whatever you're driving so
the<00:02:24.460> important<00:02:25.150> thing<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.230> important<00:02:26.620> base

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the important thing the important base

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.380 
the important thing the important base
to<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.550> point<00:02:27.640> pretty<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.180> is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to have at this point pretty much is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.840 
to have at this point pretty much is
feeble<00:02:28.960> grinds<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.440> manuals<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.640> it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
feeble grinds and manuals because it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.340 
feeble grinds and manuals because it's
sort<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> combination<00:02:31.450> between<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.200> two

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
sort of a combination between the two

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.490 
sort of a combination between the two
those<00:02:33.040> two<00:02:33.270> tricks<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.200> want<00:02:35.410> to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
those two tricks you know you want to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530 
those two tricks you know you want to
sort<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.250> figure<00:02:36.400> out<00:02:36.520> how<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> peg

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
sort of figure out how it is that a peg

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.690 
sort of figure out how it is that a peg
grind<00:02:37.660> feels<00:02:38.140> which<00:02:38.920> comes<00:02:39.250> from<00:02:39.370> feeble

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
grind feels which comes from feeble

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.050 
grind feels which comes from feeble
grinds<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.240> want<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:41.560> execution<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
grinds but you want to in execution the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.730 
grinds but you want to in execution the
ice<00:02:43.180> pick<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.480> almost<00:02:43.690> exactly<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.440> manual

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
ice pick is almost exactly like a manual

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.830 
ice pick is almost exactly like a manual
actually<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.510> want<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> make

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
actually and so you really want to make

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.230 
actually and so you really want to make
sure<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.620> manuals<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.060> your

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
sure that you have your manuals and your

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.690 
sure that you have your manuals and your
balance<00:02:49.570> points<00:02:49.960> really<00:02:50.860> figure<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.580> out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
balance points really figure it out

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
balance points really figure it out
before<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.420> start<00:02:52.690> really<00:02:53.110> trying<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
before you start really trying this

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.440 
before you start really trying this
trick<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.760> you're<00:02:54.880> having<00:02:55.030> issues<00:02:55.240> with

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
trick and if you're having issues with

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.090 
trick and if you're having issues with
the<00:02:55.660> trick<00:02:55.870> maybe<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> need<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.710> work<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.040> your

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
the trick maybe you need to work on your

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.850 
the trick maybe you need to work on your
manuals<00:02:57.520> some<00:02:57.730> more
