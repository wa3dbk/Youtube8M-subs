00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.870
 June, Jansen Estoril SID must be the highlights of the week 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
 Hadamar 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.020
 this 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.189
 and parents could hardly wait for this until I got out of the house 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.640
 that something like that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.120
 These were great expectations for someone just 18 years old 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.429
 was 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.839
 I could believe that and another family a very similar idea 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.430
 That was the day I can be a cleaner 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 shortly thereafter, the birth of our glorious reality is born 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.840
 from the creators of Shrek Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda for them 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.570
 Niedermeier Tottenham Erika storms the no secret the us exchange of 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.470
 Daycare more communities Lotte the a-final talk skillfully bring in 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.920
 Scene short so they have a worth seeing meter from the New Yorker 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 it lacks it already my children so I can from my dogs 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.360
 Melissa MÃ¼ller could also be and what others hear from schools more 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 I think it does not look a bit like George Clooney in town 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.870
 the minister was part of the party 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.160
 Cholera is 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.800
 he must first the animation is really impressive it is such a 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.810
 bigger, NASA said 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.460
 I do not know how they do it, it's just magic that's so beautiful 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.789
 animating the world rank John Isner it would have been a very talented director 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.180
 Are you just that he is late until he lets himself in the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 History made from the beginning that is the basic tenor one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 Postmodern two story from the point of view of the villain Str of the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 Europeans who mean trouble 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.409
 the movie is about 5 million 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 10 in the all-around is a little luck 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 the following seven planets come before the home tournament for the third quarter in a row 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.220
 as a reason for the little too dangerous 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.340
 on Sunday the 21 7 4 million in the end must premiere in the BMW world in 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.030
 Munich 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.100
 in the exclusive then German voice actor Bastian Pastewka and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.600
 Oliver Kalkofe and Honeywell give nationwide theatrical release is the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 make second youngest 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.460
 Schuller was cartoon and animation is how the thing is so in the matter 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.229
 is still funny in Germany 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.799
 Many still think that a tenant must be so for children 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.909
 Per cent that's not the best movies work for both me and myself 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.279
 think me thinks percent works the same way and works the same way and that is 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.339
 actually the best if you can go to the movies as a family and everyone 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.549
 Of course, finding something in the cases is quite funny to say that was once 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.069
 Once the German Burkard was there, of course I am the obvious choice 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.739
 also in America, one would have approached me nicely 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.670
 Percent No it already quite funny but only for those who know this and 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.589
 it only me who saw the original version 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.589
 and I'm the opponent of Bastian Pastewka that we're even better here 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.509
 Niedermayer make himself the meanest 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.099
 the meanest rogue 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.439
 she still exists 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.589
 around the world 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.559
 I do not know why you came straight to me 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.429
 in the selection of the cast but 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.999
 I do not think I'm doing any great at anything 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.780
 mostly not Peter Richter 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.619
 had been short 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.519
 they are even worse than the movie 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.679
 it is difficult to weight up 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:19.099
 we had a very very sweet thing that was actually the case 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.199
 now pressure 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.209
 I already have a little girl anyway 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.079
 Yes 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.599
 hor those were the highlights of the week until next time
