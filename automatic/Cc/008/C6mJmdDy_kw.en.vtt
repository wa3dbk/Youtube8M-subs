00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello I'm blaise fidel the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.820
 founder of local photos point fr is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.559
 professional photographer 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 what I propose to you is 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 to get to do photo editing 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.550
 like a pro and retouch a portrait in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 less than two minutes as a pro to me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.680
 I've been doing 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.349
 photo editing and if I taught you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.920
 all my photo editing techniques 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.510
 it would take very, very, very long 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm not sure you would have the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.270
 patience so 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 I decided to do better than that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.559
 recorded any misunderstanding of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 photo editing in actions or 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 scripts actually under photoshop one can 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.789
 save image manipulation of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.480
 techniques that allow can 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 then be easily replay like a 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.210
 little one saves macros and there my 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.880
 idea it was recorded all that I 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 knew that you or no longer 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.439
 need to replay his actions on 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 your portraits so that you can 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.860
 use all my techniques on your 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 wholesale photos what I share with 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.530
 you this is obviously my all my 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.510
 technical 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.670
 two retouches but it's also my 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.979
 wholesale workflow it's really 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.220
 all my secrets this photo editing 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.180
 go follow me I show you that then 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.880
 we will open a portrait under photoshop 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.070
 and here I go subscribers where I 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.369
 recorded everything I do 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.590
 usually on a portrait what 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.810
 you see what you see here it's 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.750
 the scripts the actions on the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 different parts of the body and I'm going 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.020
 we will not fit in size but I want 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.210
 quickly show the speed at which 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.380
 okay I will first launch a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.720
 something that I call expert retouching 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.860
 tone and textures gives me a few 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.769
 indications on how to use 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.380
 the action I put myself here almost at 100% 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:27.940
 and just look at a paintbrush now 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:29.890
 I will repaint on the skin and what is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.299
 what we see we see that already everything 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.980
 which is the smallest colors 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.930
 color differences between different 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.019
 corners of pau look i show you that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.540
 this is clearly improved and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:46.630
 now i'm going to take care here a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 little bit of small defects then 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.049
 three times nothing hop hop 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.970
 here a little bit there you see that here 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.400
 what happens and we get to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 to perfectly maintain everything that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.579
 is the normal texture of the skin the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.140
 colors everything is really very very 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.100
 very very well done so what is it 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.570
 that there is the other there is a small 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.549
 shine problem here a little 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.220
 problem of red and beat for that I 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.829
 just put a little bit of anti 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.560
 redness up I press my anti action 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.609
 redness a little brushstroke and I 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.010
 going on there to remove the problems of 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:27.459
 redness here here I put myself a little 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.530
 anti normal shine there I go back 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.519
 it was a little too strong we will do 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.580
 lentils shine light people to 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.560
 watch this is it's beautiful 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.710
 much more discreet the speed to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.870

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.610
