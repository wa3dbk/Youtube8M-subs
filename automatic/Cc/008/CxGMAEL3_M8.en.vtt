00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:12.030
 well here's the tidehead 2.4 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.630
 disassembled is quite good is this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.619
 video here to show a curiosity 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 here on the variable advance in the case 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.779
 of that car he has a breakthrough 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.779
 variable that allows 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.599
 in fact it allows you to get 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.309
 touches higher at low spin 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.460
 So that's why this happens. 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 have varied advancement in admission and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 this advance is late point behind it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.739
 control more effectively 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 torque at low speeds 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 good is basically how the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.489
 process you have a room and north 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.210
 in case it 's the one that goes to the broker 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.460
 It is only here that it is triggered by 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.070
 central to central sends a current 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 here she 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:17.909
 and this will be ours here she has a pin 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.770
 down here is what he pushes this year 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.659
 inside 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.659
 the pushes you or a sky sun that skateboard 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 just inside out 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:45.649
 How is it that you see that he has a 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 Panino take the pin here you will see 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.530
 that it has several qualities and a spring 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.299
 when you no longer have to place 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.899
 pressure will be lower if you 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.820
 putting pressure discipline that would have 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:07.259
 restored to his starting position 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:10.099
 so he comes here insured the shop goes 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.099
 pushing it here 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:18.239
 as we will your indiscipline 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.079
 Let's get out that collector 's three 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.290
 holes there are three rifles are here is 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.390
 as you dream, you're triggering that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.360
 The plane that is above here 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:37.440
 diversion of oil through these three courses 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.739
 here but this one on the right and this one 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:47.510
 diversion of oil will come in these 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:56.940
 here they are here within the best 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:03:01.470
 then there on the collector back here just from 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.299
 us and drives back to a deviation 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:23.720
 oil flow and if he looks he comes here 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:26.430
 you look and enter these two holes of the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.519
 control valve advance . 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.519
 admission 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.919
 according to the oil in gold he leaves by this 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.639
 tip here 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:44.010
 It is here to stay here is where is 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:50.299
 in this case, the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:53.989
 What are you doing out of that hole here? 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:04:00.480
 he enters this piece here 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:12.449
 This is the play here and here. 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:16.560
 enters the intake part of will run and 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:21.539
 here it is interesting the oil enters 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.490
 by her for that piece by half a point 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:29.319
 on here 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.319
 this piece here is filled with oil and 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:43.460
 push example back and then you see 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:47.780
 that the gear already has an angle 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.090
 then this angle as it goes 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.090
 leaving because it will delay the delay 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.479
 redemption 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:13.210
 and then this piece here and when it does not have 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.759
 more oil pressure on this ball here 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.759
 returns to note position
