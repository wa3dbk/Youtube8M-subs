00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.720
 i 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.269
 it's called tina is beautiful 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.269
 what a good affectionate and playful 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.700
 if you had seen it when 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.060
 we find 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.060
 Y 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.779
 the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 working routinely in the group what 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.329
 what dirt is that we receive through 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 the face an anonymous denunciation from the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.230
 city ​​of bellavista in the neighbors 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.809
 they saw the case of a few dogs 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.820
 abused that were tied in 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.070
 different ends of a house that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.199
 apparently it was uninhabited and good 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.809
 when we arrive at the house we give ourselves 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.690
 there were really four animals tied 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.180
 one in each corner of the house and one of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.190
 they were already dead and the other three 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.140
 a dog was in very serious condition 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.840
 that we thought that even not 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 We were going to get to rescue her alive 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.590
 then immediately as we see that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.390
 it is a case of animal abuse which 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.520
 we decide is what we do is always 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.530
 make the report to the police while 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 we stayed elsewhere is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.720
 doing first aid the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.310
 animals 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.899
 today do not waste time that 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.300
 it would mean the loss of life of 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.460
 the victims also then approached 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.080
 the policeman luckily took us the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.119
 complaint as corresponded did the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.340
 the police officer do only that the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.649
 animals are in very serious condition the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 let's say we gave the go-ahead for 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.740
 proceed because it also happened 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.540
 account 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.100
 of the seriousness of the matter and since 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.909
 outside it was seen that one of the animals 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.909
 was dead 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.930
 after making the complaint what 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 we did what we could correctly 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.900
 do anyone who sees there 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000
 a victim in serious condition was 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.760
 transfer them directly to the veterinarian 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.560
 and that 's when it starts all in the part of 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 rescue and recovery of animals 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.780
 of course for the bitch that was already 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.270
 dead we could not do anything what if 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.010
 this one had in signs are visible from 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.800
 that the dogs had been in some 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.360
 dog fight because we recognize the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.030
 wounds long ago we work with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.550
 animals the state of abandonment in which 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.270
 they found with chronic injuries very 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.100
 very very old very battered without 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.370
 no treatment in a state of 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.680
 I leave a very dirty place very precarious 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 where the animals really suffered from 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.270
 stress of much much malaise 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.570
 nothing that can be thought of in welfare 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.640
 animal and in the respect that they deserve 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.790
 animals that were tied chained 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.170
 it really is unfortunate in the way 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.990
 that those poor people were living 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.030
 animals what happened next is 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.370
 we make the complaint we 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 we learned that the person who was 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.050
 charge of these animals that is the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.670
 The main culprit of the abuse is 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.670
 this a veterinarian 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.770
 and what happened is that we 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.980
 we denounce the case in turn this 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.590
 person denounces us for theft after 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.890
 with the passage of time something happens 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.190
 particular in the cause and we increase the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.010
 imputation to aggravated robbery in town and 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.230
 in band to the point that it came to be asked 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.140
 an elevation trial against 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.020
 the rescuers accusing the as if 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.870
 we were 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.530
 some dangerous people and some big ones 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.530
 thieves 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.560
 we will go through the whole world with our 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.560
 phrases with our bodies 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.050
 and who 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.690
 as if he was a very good person 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.880
 healthy for society that has not 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.410
 had nothing to do with this and it's like 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.410
 a victim and we who are the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.330
 rescuers the activists that we are the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.720
 that we remove the serious animals from there 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.430
 we are like thieves to think that 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.520
 those animals needed attention and 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.910
 they were not given then by negligence or 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.810
 for lack of attention there really would be 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.280
 that condemn this type of facts because 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.460
 they are attacking welfare 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.460
 animal 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.120
 and exactly what we are trying to 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.430
 to seek is for justice to understand that 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.870
 they are not things that are served sentient 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.510
 of respect and make them worthy of 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.550
 such lack that justice understands me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.220
 that there is a law that protects them that 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.560
 report that is instructed not to stand 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.200
 to the abusers who 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.330
 batterers come out clean come out like 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 If nothing had happened that is not 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.950
 blaming punishing the people who work 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.450
 to pain in which he works as we do not 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.520
 on axis or to anyone in the 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.200
 society that has decided this doing 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.950
 prevail the right one life and has 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.950
 decided to act 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.960
 the thing 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.030
 it is moral and ethical to know that if 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.070
 any human or any other animal 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.530
 needs help and is thrown away as 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.810
 been the case of these animals in the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.810
 background of a dying or serious house 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.130
 we are always going to act 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.130
 the good of life prevails 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.300
 we are ordinary people in society in 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.370
 which we have our jobs 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.280
 own we have our studies 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.660
 our families and in turn all of 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.700
 animals that are under our care 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.460
 under our protection that daily 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.730
 what he does is a common routine of 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.200
 special care feeding in 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.930
 where they are fed daily 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.790
 daily they are medicated daily 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.790
 they do integration work with them 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.310
 The help we ask from society is 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.980
 to continue the case that case report 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.570
 by social networks that spread that the 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.580
 spread by facebook to spread it 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.950
 by twitter to help us by attending 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.080
 the mobilizations that we organize that 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.150
 find out that there are activists who are 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.550
 being charged for theft that is a 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.010
 serious cause this where you can give 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.550
 prison to people who are 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.550
 declared guilty 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.590
 What helps us the most is the 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.849
 dissemination on social networks so that 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.889
 everyone finds out what it is that 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.960
 is happening with the cause and it is 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.539
 It is very important that there are many people 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.939
 and grouped in this type of associations 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.999
 dedicated to the defense of rights 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:33.849
 of the animals if we could 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:36.909
 ask the animals how they felt 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:41.069
 that day we are sure that they would have 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.069
 asked us to take them from that place
