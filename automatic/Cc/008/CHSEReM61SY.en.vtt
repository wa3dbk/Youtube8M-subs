00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:18.109

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.070
 from the shortcut game lego batman 3 the 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.390

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 I'm going to change here as I can see. Can I? 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
 I wanted to show you people. 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 a video of the extra mail and half mouth that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 It was one thing I discovered after 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.120
 I did the 100% here I do not know if it has to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.149
 reach 100% to be able to open up 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.239
 you already had it but I just went to see 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.329
 This now that I've arrived at 100% beauty 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.100
 We need to come here in the tower. 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.430
 certain surveillance and then we will go 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.300
 here in this door here until the big ball 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.399
 here it's boring talking about the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.299
 right side has this door that opens the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.640
 people take that trophy room to the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.560
 observation and there has a stop rolling 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.560
 here what I did not have before 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.330
 huh 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.409

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:36.979
 the 'green lantern' west side and the face 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.439
 of television there the conner when brian 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 this room who before had nothing just 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.289
 I had such status here spider veins and then 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.259
 I thought it was cool, I decided to show it to you. 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.149
 You do not know if it's only 16 percent 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.189
 we get it here but I 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.599
 I've never seen this galley assembled 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.549

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.849
 Lever that does what I do not know never 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.369
 I pulled Paula here from the recording 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:12.560
 Let's see what happens when people 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:21.700
 pull that lever there light rain 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 Look at these people money. 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.150
 It is falling more the rascal is very 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.680
 money 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:42.990
 look to see how many billions we arrive 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.990
 Here they are playing money. 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:57.430
 whoa I got sick people that damn O 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.010
 cool this is something that is let 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.410
 to go by without wanting to come here and discovered 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.550
 this rain lever makes rain 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:19.570
 money 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:23.170
 CalÃ³ that does not speak old trickster and there 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.260
 will not stop ever will never stop will it end 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.110
 It's just the time that music lasts and 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.080
 Lever we can only pull once 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.330
 it looks like an ether is old guinea 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.330
 Okay, that's it, opa 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.910
 That's when I never had it right but I did not 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.220
 I saw no video on youtube, I do not think 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.310
 if it's called that rain scheme 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.410
 of money but you're there right? 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.410
 Wow, what a fantastic game it does not stop. 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.280
 of surprising even after 100% 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.920
 This character I really like 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.239
 hence a frankstein 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.239
 Ok now I'm going to kill these 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.239
 here and there in the area and alone 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:12.379
 they return our very good comments that 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.420
 Did you find Sst and the rain of money? 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.329
 I swear I did not know this. 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.729
 I happened to come into the room now and 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.539
 I found actually looking for a 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.539
 another thing 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.289
 I'm good, I finally get more 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.850
 Something here in the game I come 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.130
 bringing video to you if I had 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.479
 I pulled the lever without recording I was going to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.360
 old car will have to come in and if I 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.979
 come back in there will come rain of money 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.449
 not again, this can only make one 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.710
 not right 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.310
 if I had done it without recording 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.380
 likely to continue without knowing 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.050
 If you already knew that, 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.690
 underneath blue that already knew me years said 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.720

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.639
 This surprised you if you discovered this. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.620
 now no comments and I'm also 100% 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.690
 I do not know if this is what the 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.849
 people have to do to enable and 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.430
 leverage in that room is because before 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.349

 happened in your game, thanks guys 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.180

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.030
 business I did not know what it was 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.280

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.919
