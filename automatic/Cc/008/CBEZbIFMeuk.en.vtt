fSV<00:00:08.150> four-stroke<00:00:09.150> engine<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> new

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
fSV four-stroke engine this is a new

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
fSV four-stroke engine this is a new
engine<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.070> OS<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.700> released<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.389> past

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
engine that OS is released in the past

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.640 
engine that OS is released in the past
few<00:00:13.019> months<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.490> uses<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> angled<00:00:15.420> valve

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
few months and it uses an angled valve

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.650 
few months and it uses an angled valve
configuration<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.910> separate<00:00:18.330> rocker

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
configuration with two separate rocker

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.920 
configuration with two separate rocker
covers<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> great-looking<00:00:20.640> engine<00:00:20.970> runs<00:00:21.689> as

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
covers so a great-looking engine runs as

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.420 
covers so a great-looking engine runs as
good<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> looked

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

propeller<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.099> seven<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.580> we've

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
propeller of the seven that we've

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.240 
propeller of the seven that we've
included<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.300> our<00:00:27.390> testing<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.890> APC

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
included in our testing and it's an APC

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
included in our testing and it's an APC
15<00:00:29.970> by<00:00:30.179> 8<00:00:40.700> 84<00:00:41.700> decibels<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.469> we'll<00:00:43.680> start

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
15 by 8 84 decibels so first we'll start

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
15 by 8 84 decibels so first we'll start
the<00:00:44.100> engine<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.640> we'll<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.940> run<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the engine then we'll just run the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
the engine then we'll just run the
throttle<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.050> by<00:00:46.200> manual<00:00:46.620> control

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
throttle up and down by manual control

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.639 
throttle up and down by manual control
then<00:00:47.760> we'll<00:00:47.879> switch<00:00:48.090> over<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> PC<00:00:48.660> control<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
then we'll switch over to PC control and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.790 
then we'll switch over to PC control and
the<00:00:50.610> computer<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.149> run<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> engine<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.379> five

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the computer will run the engine at five

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.090 
the computer will run the engine at five
seconds<00:00:53.340> each<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:54.030> idle<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.870> 20%<00:00:55.289> throttle

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
seconds each at idle then 20% throttle

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
seconds each at idle then 20% throttle
then<00:00:56.430> 40<00:00:56.820> percent<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.809> 60<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.500> 80<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then 40 percent then 60 then 80 and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
then 40 percent then 60 then 80 and
finally<00:00:59.399> full<00:00:59.640> throttle<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.899> data<00:01:01.289> collected

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
finally full throttle the data collected

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.670 
finally full throttle the data collected
in<00:01:01.890> each<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.309> stable<00:01:02.820> throttle<00:01:03.210> point

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
in each of these stable throttle point

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.230 
in each of these stable throttle point
for<00:01:04.680> me<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> seven<00:01:05.400> propellers<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
for me to the seven propellers will be

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
for me to the seven propellers will be
used<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.659> generate<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.170> performance<00:01:07.740> graphs

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
used to generate the performance graphs

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
used to generate the performance graphs
that<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.119> published<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.689> our<00:01:09.840> review<00:01:10.500> article

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that we published in our review article

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:28.969 
that we published in our review article
on<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> engine

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:47.780 

on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> throttle<00:01:30.060> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:02:19.589 

over<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.880> PC<00:01:49.090> control<00:01:52.350> 20%<00:01:53.350> throttle

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.809 

but<00:02:20.599> again<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.959> engine<00:02:21.080> turn

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
but again the engine turn

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.099 
but again the engine turn
7900<00:02:22.819> rpm<00:02:23.239> producing<00:02:24.019> nine<00:02:24.440> pounds<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.980> thrust
