 this one in a few words selected 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.890
 we click to impose my room 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.100
 says it's okay that's not the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.100
 piece 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.970
 it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.619

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.619
 selected to move 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.660
 I like that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.660
 when it works we drop 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 ben 10 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.830
 but 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.480
 here anika 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.120
 then there is a button that is very 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.790
 useful is the final rendering to remove 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.110
 everything that is all round so 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.360
 there we see that it is disabled tip 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.910
 breasts if you click activate 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.350
 it's magic the turn disappears and you 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.290
 really have the final rendering of your 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.160
 room so we'll continue flying 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.460
 disabled for shapes it's not bad 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.510
 we will put some logos so 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.700
 from here a whole logo palette we're going 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 search them ranked by alpha ba 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.990
 alphabetical yes so suddenly if you 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.490
 want logos ya less high than this 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.610
 is at the moment in front of the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:31.350
 bench so I'm taught white 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.350
 selection on removal to enlarge 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.209
 the story for me 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.209
 I take a little writing month 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.120
 selection of breaks repositions a 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 a bit 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.180
