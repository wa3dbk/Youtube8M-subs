likes<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:38.390> inspect<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> box<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.050> us<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:42.059> see

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
likes it inspect the box for us you see

00:00:42.300 --> 00:01:04.410 
likes it inspect the box for us you see
anything<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:43.579> how<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> Mac<00:00:47.300> good<00:00:48.300> okay

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.430 

so<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:07.040> is<00:01:07.250> very<00:01:07.840> energy-efficient<00:01:08.840> you'll

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
so it is very energy-efficient you'll

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.940 
so it is very energy-efficient you'll
only<00:01:09.650> be<00:01:09.920> paying<00:01:10.280> 16<00:01:11.030> dollars<00:01:11.450> per<00:01:11.780> year<00:01:12.050> three

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
only be paying 16 dollars per year three

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.109 
only be paying 16 dollars per year three
USB<00:01:13.369> ports<00:01:14.619> we<00:01:15.619> have<00:01:16.869> four<00:01:17.869> HDMI<00:01:19.930> interesting

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
USB ports we have four HDMI interesting

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.940 
USB ports we have four HDMI interesting
they<00:01:23.119> have<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:24.380> order<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.800> do<00:01:25.090> component

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
they have in order to do component

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.190 
they have in order to do component
there's<00:01:27.950> probably<00:01:28.670> wires<00:01:29.149> in<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.600> box

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
there's probably wires in the box

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.990 
there's probably wires in the box
I<00:01:31.540> guess<00:01:32.540> that's<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.250> minimize<00:01:34.250> ports<00:01:34.820> back

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
I guess that's to minimize ports back

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.050 
I guess that's to minimize ports back
here<00:01:35.300> right<00:01:36.170> Mac<00:01:36.380> Oh<00:01:36.430> hardware<00:01:37.430> pieces<00:01:37.670> that

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
here right Mac Oh hardware pieces that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.389 
here right Mac Oh hardware pieces that
came<00:01:38.300> with<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> TV<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.800> goes<00:01:40.130> on<00:01:40.310> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
came with the TV that goes on the

backside of TV and this stand which is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.660 
backside of TV and this stand which is
glass<00:01:45.130> would<00:01:46.130> be<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.399> base<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.310> our<00:01:49.460> old

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
glass would be the base this is our old

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.999 
glass would be the base this is our old
TV<00:01:50.890> we're<00:01:51.890> upgrading<00:01:52.130> from<00:01:53.050> Westinghouse<00:01:54.050> and

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
TV we're upgrading from Westinghouse and

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.300 
TV we're upgrading from Westinghouse and
it's<00:01:55.310> only<00:01:55.520> 32<00:01:56.000> inches<00:01:56.720> but<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.920> was<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> very

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's only 32 inches but it was a very

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's only 32 inches but it was a very
nice<00:01:58.610> TV<00:01:58.940> we'll<00:01:59.840> go<00:02:00.050> into<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.619> master<00:02:01.010> bedroom

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.899 

so<00:02:04.909> for<00:02:05.240> instructions<00:02:05.930> we<00:02:06.170> have<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.729> put<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
so for instructions we have to put the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.949 
so for instructions we have to put the
TV<00:02:08.330> backing<00:02:08.929> onto<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.769> base<00:02:10.100> first<00:02:10.959> screwed

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
TV backing onto the base first screwed

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.900 
TV backing onto the base first screwed
on<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.440> four<00:02:13.070> screws<00:02:13.989> remote<00:02:14.989> control<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
on with four screws remote control the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.300 
on with four screws remote control the
wires<00:02:17.180> component<00:02:17.870> wires<00:02:19.120> manual<00:02:21.130> very<00:02:22.130> good

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
wires component wires manual very good

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.900 
wires component wires manual very good
fun<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.480> trick<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.870> when<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
fun so the trick is when we have the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.729 
fun so the trick is when we have the
swivel<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> base<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.049> next<00:02:27.290> thing<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.560> do

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
swivel on the base the next thing to do

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.910 
swivel on the base the next thing to do
is<00:02:27.769> lay<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.549> TV<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.260> box<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.739> base

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
is lay the TV on a box so that the base

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.979 
is lay the TV on a box so that the base
can<00:02:34.160> hang<00:02:34.340> off<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.970> end<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.600> okay<00:02:35.959> so

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
can hang off the end like that okay so

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.970 
can hang off the end like that okay so
we<00:02:36.440> assemble<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> base<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.500> TV

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
we assemble the base and we have the TV

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.140 
we assemble the base and we have the TV
in<00:02:40.190> place<00:02:42.070> ready<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.310> hook<00:02:43.489> up<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.560> Direct<00:02:45.560> TV

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
in place ready to hook up to Direct TV

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.970 
in place ready to hook up to Direct TV
and<00:02:47.150> we'll<00:02:47.720> show<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.709> final

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and we'll show you that in the final

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.319 
and we'll show you that in the final
shot<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:51.620> interesting<00:02:52.160> detail<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.790> there's

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
shot one interesting detail is there's

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.569 
shot one interesting detail is there's
this<00:02:53.570> adapter<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.739> goes<00:02:54.950> into<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.340> back<00:02:55.549> of

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
this adapter that goes into the back of

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.880 
this adapter that goes into the back of
the<00:02:55.790> TV<00:02:56.000> when<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.480> want<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.810> connect<00:02:57.290> your

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
the TV when you want to connect your

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.720 
the TV when you want to connect your
component<00:02:58.519> cables<00:02:58.970> which<00:02:59.600> will<00:03:00.400> be<00:03:01.400> what<00:03:01.700> I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
component cables which will be what I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.960 
component cables which will be what I
will<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.380> Xbox<00:03:03.829> 360<00:03:04.519> since<00:03:04.760> it's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
will do with the Xbox 360 since it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.420 
will do with the Xbox 360 since it's
only

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
only

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.319 
only
component<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.700> remote<00:03:08.969> control

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
component so this is the remote control

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.619 
component so this is the remote control
that<00:03:09.480> comes<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> Samsung<00:03:10.319> DS<00:03:10.920> 6000<00:03:11.909> would

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
that comes with a Samsung DS 6000 would

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:25.899 
that comes with a Samsung DS 6000 would
you<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.140> do<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.469> honors<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:15.620> fire<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.859> up
