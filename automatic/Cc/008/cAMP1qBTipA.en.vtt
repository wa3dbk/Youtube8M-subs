alright we're out on the farm again take
another<00:00:04.560> farm<00:00:05.069> video<00:00:05.520> we're<00:00:06.270> actually<00:00:06.450> uh

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
another farm video we're actually uh

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.089 
another farm video we're actually uh
checking<00:00:08.760> our<00:00:08.940> seed<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.510> last<00:00:09.780> week<00:00:10.590> June<00:00:10.920> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.749 
checking our seed from last week June I
guess<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.769> stuff<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.549> was

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
guess it was the stuff is and I was
putting<00:00:15.059> mesh<00:00:15.650> there's<00:00:16.650> gonna<00:00:16.770> pick<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.130> one

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
putting mesh there's gonna pick up one

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.130 
putting mesh there's gonna pick up one
of<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.400> cages<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:17.880> gonna<00:00:18.000> check<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> out

on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> farm<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:41.160> don't<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.520> anything

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
on the farm you don't see anything

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.229 
on the farm you don't see anything
except<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.390> water<00:00:43.730> gauges<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.059> long

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

lines<00:00:46.850> I'm<00:00:47.850> coming<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.450> now

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
lines I'm coming up right now

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.970 
lines I'm coming up right now
a<00:00:50.510> lot<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> people<00:00:51.809> ask<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> fouling<00:00:52.710> on

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
a lot of people ask about the fouling on

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
a lot of people ask about the fouling on
the<00:00:53.100> cage<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.879> pressure<00:00:54.120> wash<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the cage like do we pressure wash the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
the cage like do we pressure wash the
cages<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> answer<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
cages or what the answer is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.029 
cages or what the answer is
we<00:00:57.329> used<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.660> pressure<00:00:57.899> wash<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.949> don't

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
we used to pressure wash a lot we don't

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
we used to pressure wash a lot we don't
pressure<00:00:59.340> wash<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> air<00:00:59.879> as<00:00:59.969> much<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.420> we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
pressure wash the air as much now we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
pressure wash the air as much now we
found<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:00.960> wishers<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.620> fine<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
found out wishers do just fine the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
found out wishers do just fine the
fouling<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> real<00:01:03.570> bad<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> cage<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.820> real

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
fouling is real bad and the cage is real

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
fouling is real bad and the cage is real
heavy<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.840> sea<00:01:07.049> squirts<00:01:07.380> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
heavy like when we get sea squirts then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.140 
heavy like when we get sea squirts then
we'll<00:01:07.920> hit<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> before<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.580> bring<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
we'll hit it before we bring it in to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.530 
we'll hit it before we bring it in to
work<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:16.909> probably<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.240> easier<00:01:18.479> if

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
work it probably a little bit easier if

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
work it probably a little bit easier if
two<00:01:18.720> people<00:01:18.900> were<00:01:19.110> working<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> right

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
two people were working this one right

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:31.460 
two people were working this one right
now<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:21.380> one<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.560> handle<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 

all<00:01:32.010> right<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.340> said<00:01:32.550> one<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> things

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
all right like I said one of the things

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.490 
all right like I said one of the things
that<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> bags<00:01:36.840> quicker<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that we do to get out of bags quicker is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
that we do to get out of bags quicker is
will<00:01:37.680> line<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.980> inside<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.760> cage<00:01:39.000> -<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
will line the inside of the cage - it's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.250 
will line the inside of the cage - it's
just<00:01:40.080> actually<00:01:40.440> some<00:01:41.130> bags<00:01:41.340> cut<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.990> or<00:01:42.990> clam

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
just actually some bags cut up or clam

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.010 
just actually some bags cut up or clam
that<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:45.150> year<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:45.510> actually<00:01:45.660> going<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that this year we're actually going to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.590 
that this year we're actually going to
be<00:01:46.140> using<00:01:46.470> their<00:01:46.620> half<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.950> half<00:01:47.100> cages<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:48.450> get

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
be using their half a half cages to get

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.400 
be using their half a half cages to get
out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:48.960> message<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.410> faster<00:01:51.230> it<00:01:52.230> seems

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
out of the message and faster it seems

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.050 
out of the message and faster it seems
like<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> mesh<00:01:53.460> all

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
like when you get out of the mesh all

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
like when you get out of the mesh all
right<00:01:54.300> get<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.510> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> bags<00:01:54.960> we're<00:01:55.380> able<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
right get out of the bags we're able to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
right get out of the bags we're able to
use<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> cages<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.610> efficiently<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> grow

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
use the cages more efficiently and grow

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:08.960 
use the cages more efficiently and grow
more<00:01:57.690> oysters<00:01:58.350> faster<00:02:07.520> let's<00:02:08.520> light<00:02:08.700> anything

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
more oysters faster let's light anything

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.930 
more oysters faster let's light anything
growing<00:02:11.210> up<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> cage<00:02:13.460> okay<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.880> we

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
growing up in the cage okay so when we

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.890 
growing up in the cage okay so when we
put<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.420> stuff<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> stuff

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
put all this stuff in here and the stuff

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.000 
put all this stuff in here and the stuff
that<00:02:19.110> came<00:02:19.380> off<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.830> us<00:02:20.120> 349<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.830> good

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that came off of us 349 it's good

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.350 
that came off of us 349 it's good
definitely<00:02:26.010> he<00:02:26.490> would<00:02:29.060> sow<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.180> seed<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:32.360> how

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
definitely he would sow that seed is how

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.800 
definitely he would sow that seed is how
old<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.380> stuff<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.740> from<00:02:34.920> June

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.480 

you<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:38.990> see<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.350> got<00:02:39.500> all<00:02:39.650> kinds<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> sisal

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
you can see you got all kinds of sisal

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.460 
you can see you got all kinds of sisal
issues<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.910> there<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.720> stuff<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.080> bring<00:02:42.290> in

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
issues in there this stuff will bring in
