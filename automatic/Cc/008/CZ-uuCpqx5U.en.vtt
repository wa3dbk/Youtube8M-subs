 hello welcome to the folk recording 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.880
 let's explain the operation 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.880
 so I 've always cleaned seeds 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:29.349
 now with the food left over from the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.349
 numbers of our years I will explain 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.839
 here we have a container with food 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.520
 that we have removed from the feeders 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:41.580
 we glimpse cleaned the summarize 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.360
 if we look little by little of joy with the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.360
 superior vegetable 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.110
 that they have to fall into this appearance 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:17.840
 we turn off the seed videos that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.260
 we see here we can find the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.260
 husks 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.120

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.120

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.180
 only 80% of society is eliminated 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.180
 we turn on the seedbed 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.910
 problems of fracture injuries 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910
 higher 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 we turn off seed indicator and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 we will be again 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.970
