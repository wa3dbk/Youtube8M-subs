result of the process called

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.020 
result of the process called
hybridization<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.250> I'm<00:01:19.850> going<00:01:20.000> to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
hybridization and I'm going to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.760 
hybridization and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:20.179> just<00:01:21.079> basically<00:01:21.500> what

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
demonstrate just basically what

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.649 
demonstrate just basically what
hybridization<00:01:22.579> is<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.960> take<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:26.270> sexual

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
hybridization is you take the the sexual

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.380 
hybridization is you take the the sexual
parts<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.380> iris<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.860> male<00:01:28.579> part<00:01:28.969> from<00:01:29.179> one

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
parts of the iris the male part from one

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.410 
parts of the iris the male part from one
iris<00:01:30.100> which<00:01:31.100> contains<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.789> pollen<00:01:32.209> and<00:01:32.299> you

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
iris which contains the pollen and you

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.199 
iris which contains the pollen and you
place<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.469> pollen<00:01:33.859> on<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.219> female<00:01:34.609> parts<00:01:35.030> of

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
place the pollen on the female parts of

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.590 
place the pollen on the female parts of
a<00:01:35.299> second<00:01:35.689> iris<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.609> you<00:01:37.789> combine<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
a second iris so that you combine the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.260 
a second iris so that you combine the
traits<00:01:38.899> of<00:01:39.170> one<00:01:39.649> iris<00:01:40.009> with<00:01:40.310> another<00:01:40.609> in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
traits of one iris with another in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.149 
traits of one iris with another in
crossing<00:01:41.569> these<00:01:41.869> two<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.170> wanted<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:42.770> get<00:01:43.009> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
crossing these two I wanted to get the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.219 
crossing these two I wanted to get the
orange<00:01:43.549> beard<00:01:43.819> from<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.780> plant<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:47.229> present

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
orange beard from this plant to present

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.870 
orange beard from this plant to present
itself<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.920> new<00:01:49.280> plant<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.599> color<00:01:51.880> so

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
itself on a new plant of this color so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.969 
itself on a new plant of this color so
I've<00:01:53.179> taken<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> pollen<00:01:53.959> and<00:01:54.079> transferred<00:01:54.860> it

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
I've taken the pollen and transferred it

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.490 
I've taken the pollen and transferred it
hopefully<00:01:55.879> when<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.329> get<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.810> new<00:01:56.959> plant<00:01:57.289> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
hopefully when I get the new plant it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.369 
hopefully when I get the new plant it
will<00:01:57.679> have<00:01:57.860> an<00:01:58.039> orange<00:01:58.399> beard<00:01:58.759> on<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.079> it<00:02:00.079> may

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:00.379 
will have an orange beard on it it may

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.979 
will have an orange beard on it it may
not<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.860> lot<00:02:01.099> of<00:02:01.219> times<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.989> hybridization

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
not a lot of times the hybridization

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.469 
not a lot of times the hybridization
process<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.159> random<00:02:04.489> and<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.270> don't

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
process is just random and you don't

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.209 
process is just random and you don't
really<00:02:05.719> know<00:02:06.020> what<00:02:06.229> you're<00:02:06.349> gonna<00:02:06.500> get<00:02:06.739> that's

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
really know what you're gonna get that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.580 
really know what you're gonna get that's
part<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.849> fun<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> hybridizing<00:02:09.019> you<00:02:09.440> get

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
part of the fun of hybridizing you get

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.460 
part of the fun of hybridizing you get
to<00:02:09.739> go<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.459> springtime<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.720> see<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
to go out in the springtime and see the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.039 
to go out in the springtime and see the
new<00:02:13.069> plants<00:02:13.579> bloom<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.269> first<00:02:14.480> time<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
new plants bloom for the first time and

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:36.910 
new plants bloom for the first time and
see<00:02:15.680> what<00:02:15.889> you've<00:02:16.180> created

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.220 

the<00:02:37.920> iris<00:02:38.370> has<00:02:38.610> an<00:02:38.790> almost<00:02:39.090> unlimited<00:02:39.750> range

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the iris has an almost unlimited range

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.370 
the iris has an almost unlimited range
of<00:02:40.530> color<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:42.210> textures<00:02:42.690> from<00:02:43.020> plant<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
of color and the textures from plant to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590 
of color and the textures from plant to
plant<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:44.160> vary<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.300> believe

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
plant just vary so that I believe

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.530 
plant just vary so that I believe
everybody<00:02:46.230> would<00:02:46.470> enjoy<00:02:46.740> them<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:48.240> want<00:02:48.480> to

invite you to come out and look at the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.310 
invite you to come out and look at the

find<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.950> you've<00:02:56.070> seen<00:02:56.340> before<00:02:56.490> seeing

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
find some that you've seen before seeing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.510 
find some that you've seen before seeing
lots<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.020> bet<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.800> find<00:02:59.220> something
