how<00:00:19.619> I've<00:00:19.830> managed<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> create<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> farm

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
how I've managed to create a farm

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
how I've managed to create a farm
obviously<00:00:22.859> without<00:00:23.039> using<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.910> week<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
obviously without using the week to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
obviously without using the week to
lower<00:00:24.960> animals<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.740> haven't<00:00:26.099> got

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
lower animals because we haven't got

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.800 
lower animals because we haven't got
that<00:00:26.250> yet<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.090> making<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> most<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that yet so I'm making the most of it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
that yet so I'm making the most of it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
later as you can see I've got quite a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.049 
later as you can see I've got quite a
few<00:00:35.550> animals<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> spawned<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> area

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
few animals that spawned in the area

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
few animals that spawned in the area
what<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> basically<00:00:39.329> did<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.010> flattened<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
what I basically did is flattened out a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.869 
what I basically did is flattened out a
big<00:00:41.340> area<00:00:42.440> plot<00:00:43.440> my<00:00:43.559> ice<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> middle<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
big area plot my ice in the middle it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.100 
big area plot my ice in the middle it
was<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> middle<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> woodland<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.930> had<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
was in the middle of a woodland so had a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
was in the middle of a woodland so had a
few<00:00:46.320> problems<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> beginning<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.670> wolf

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

spawning quite a few yeah basically i
flattened<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> area<00:00:53.539> put<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> fence

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
flattened like the area put a fence

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.330 
flattened like the area put a fence
around<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.559> stop<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> animals<00:00:56.129> getting

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
around it to stop the animals getting

out and then also I lied some space
along<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> outside<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> spawn

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
along the outside for things to spawn

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
along the outside for things to spawn
and<00:01:01.649> fall<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:03.589> yeah<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.159> heard<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.180> I

what I would recommend guys is make sure
that<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.780> move<00:01:16.049> too<00:01:16.320> far<00:01:16.530> initially<00:01:17.280> if

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that you don't move too far initially if

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
that you don't move too far initially if
you're<00:01:17.610> trying<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> produce<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.900> animal

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you're trying to produce a good animal

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
you're trying to produce a good animal
farm<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.100> end<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.430> quite

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
farm because you will end up with quite

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
farm because you will end up with quite
a<00:01:20.939> few<00:01:21.030> mob<00:01:21.720> spawning<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:23.009> you'll<00:01:23.159> never

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a few mob spawning and then you'll never

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.770 
a few mob spawning and then you'll never
be<00:01:23.520> able<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.000> again<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.450> try<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
be able to find them again to try and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
be able to find them again to try and
get<00:01:25.080> rid<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> they're<00:01:26.159> taking<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
get rid of them and they're taking it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
get rid of them and they're taking it
but<00:01:26.610> valuable<00:01:27.060> space<00:01:27.530> right<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> did<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
but valuable space right so what I did I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
but valuable space right so what I did I
went<00:01:29.340> around<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> edge<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.960> not

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
went around the edge just like this not

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
went around the edge just like this not
not<00:01:31.619> too<00:01:31.799> far<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.820> rid<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
not too far got rid of all of the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
not too far got rid of all of the
animals<00:01:33.720> which<00:01:33.990> essentially<00:01:34.740> meant<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
animals which essentially meant that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.420 
animals which essentially meant that
they<00:01:35.280> started<00:01:35.729> spawning<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:37.079> area<00:01:37.890> next<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
they started spawning in my area next to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.080 
they started spawning in my area next to
my<00:01:38.549> house<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:42.320> yeah<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.369> ended<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.880> working

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
my house and yeah so it ended up working

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.499 
my house and yeah so it ended up working
quite<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:45.540> actually<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.850> find<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
quite well actually so I now I find that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
quite well actually so I now I find that
I've<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.899> no<00:01:49.049> animal<00:01:49.439> spawning<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
I've got no animal spawning on the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
I've got no animal spawning on the
outside<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.520> I've<00:01:50.729> reached<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.240> capacity

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
outside because I've reached my capacity

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
outside because I've reached my capacity
on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> inside<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.680> house<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
on the inside of my house so then I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
on the inside of my house so then I
started<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:54.780> around<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.439> creating<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
started going around and creating a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
started going around and creating a
meadow<00:01:56.600> using<00:01:57.600> bone<00:01:57.810> meal<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.409> grow<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> grass

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
meadow using bone meal to grow the grass

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.410 
meadow using bone meal to grow the grass
and<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.310> looks<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.520> pretty<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and actually looks really pretty but I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.389 
and actually looks really pretty but I
just<00:02:00.810> tried<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> thought<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
just tried it out because I thought it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.569 
just tried it out because I thought it
would<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:02.700> away<00:02:03.030> any<00:02:03.829> available<00:02:04.829> spawning

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
would take away any available spawning

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.960 
would take away any available spawning
areas<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.560> obviously<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.789> can

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
areas for you know obviously you can

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029 
areas for you know obviously you can
probably<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.509> haven't<00:02:09.780> finished<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.470> yet

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
probably see I haven't finished it yet

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.069 
probably see I haven't finished it yet
but<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.489> haven't<00:02:12.180> found<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.689> any<00:02:12.870> more

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
but I haven't found that any more

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.800 
but I haven't found that any more
animals<00:02:13.260> are<00:02:13.590> spawning<00:02:13.829> it<00:02:14.209> right<00:02:15.209> I'll<00:02:15.480> show

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
animals are spawning it right I'll show

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.920 
animals are spawning it right I'll show
you<00:02:15.870> quickly<00:02:16.379> how<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:18.439> did<00:02:19.439> it<00:02:20.629> I'm<00:02:21.629> sure<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> lot

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you quickly how I did it I'm sure a lot

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.880 
you quickly how I did it I'm sure a lot
of<00:02:22.049> people<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.409> done<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.680> way

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
of people have done it this way

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.979 
of people have done it this way
literally<00:02:23.730> having<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.299> block<00:02:24.599> around<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
literally having a block around the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.530 
literally having a block around the
outside<00:02:25.500> next<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.609> fence<00:02:26.969> and<00:02:27.299> then<00:02:27.359> they

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
outside next to a fence and then they

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.690 
outside next to a fence and then they
can't<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.989> back<00:02:28.079> out<00:02:28.260> again<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:29.250> make<00:02:29.670> sure

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
can't get back out again so make sure

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.059 
can't get back out again so make sure
that<00:02:30.049> there<00:02:31.049> are<00:02:31.230> no<00:02:31.260> blocks<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.799> they<00:02:31.920> can

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
that there are no blocks that they can

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.170 
that there are no blocks that they can
jump<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.939> back<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> fencing

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
jump on to get back out of the fencing

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.460 
jump on to get back out of the fencing
because<00:02:36.180> otherwise<00:02:36.420> you'll<00:02:36.840> lose<00:02:37.049> all<00:02:37.409> of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
because otherwise you'll lose all of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
because otherwise you'll lose all of
your<00:02:37.590> animals<00:02:37.769> as<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.670> see<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:38.939> working

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
your animals as you can see it's working

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.849 
your animals as you can see it's working
really<00:02:39.329> well<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.049> might<00:02:40.200> notice<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.650> lack<00:02:40.799> of

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
really well you might notice a lack of

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.679 
really well you might notice a lack of
sheep<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:41.579> just<00:02:41.730> because<00:02:41.909> I'm<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.629> a

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
sheep but that's just because I'm in a

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.360 
sheep but that's just because I'm in a
woodland<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.290> wolves<00:02:43.650> keep<00:02:43.829> coming<00:02:44.129> in<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
woodland and wolves keep coming in and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
woodland and wolves keep coming in and
eating<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.659> massive<00:02:46.079> issue<00:02:46.260> i

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
eating them it's not a massive issue i

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
eating them it's not a massive issue i
can<00:02:46.769> probably<00:02:46.980> work<00:02:47.310> out<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.549> way<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> stop<00:02:47.909> that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
can probably work out a way to stop that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.379 
can probably work out a way to stop that
but<00:02:48.989> yeah<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.579> really<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.239> can
