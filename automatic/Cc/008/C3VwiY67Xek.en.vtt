00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
serve as it usually the drivers so we

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.860 
serve as it usually the drivers so we
need<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.700> try<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.000> ship<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.270> back<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.660> can

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
need to try and ship that back if we can

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
need to try and ship that back if we can
but<00:02:32.130> we're<00:02:33.130> looking<00:02:33.400> forward<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.240> race

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420

they're<00:02:34.690> too<00:02:34.870> low<00:02:35.020> downforce<00:02:35.260> configuration

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
they're too low downforce configuration

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.580 
they're too low downforce configuration
so<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> cars<00:02:36.610> move<00:02:36.850> around<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> lot<00:02:37.270> more<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so the cars move around a lot more to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.260 
so the cars move around a lot more to
DRS<00:02:39.130> zones<00:02:39.400> which<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.850> interesting<00:02:40.240> for
