00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.440
 the motorcycle stolen 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.209
 The water cut so far is all made of aluminum and painted with 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.349
 high resistance 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.839
 this allows for a much greater durability than its part of humanity 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.169
 and a better roof finish 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.509
 with the stolen water matching the color of the pieces 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.739
 The installation is very simple and can be done by taylor himself 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 a carpenter 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.750
 to do this simply put a recall segment of about 50 centimeters between 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.120
 the existing targets will give greater firmness to the structure of the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.820
 will prevent kneading during installation 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.890
 the water stolen so far already comes with previmpa 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.090
 which facilitates its beauty on the roof 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.380
 and prevent the charges being made wrong or even tarts in addition to 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.120
 water stolen so far 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.810
 allows you to create a 2% link break 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 which prevents even in torrential rain from falling water 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.660
 speed from the roof part from one plane to another 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 entering under the tiles 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.510
 this unique feature of this product 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.100
 to double on Saturday 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.350
 you must use the machine 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 or I fell hard as a guide 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.130
 one must always talk of the brann the central link of the waters 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 to form what is given to 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.350
 after 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.700
 The lateral creases should be folded from what was 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.330
 the stolen water must be installed from the bottom up 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.229
 and should be preached to hear about it with nails 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.859
 the fixing nails 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.379
 should be treated with 15 liter to ensure the seal 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.379
 the room of the piece can be easily made with the treasure to leave the band and 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.679
 to the minimum overlap of stolen water 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:28.639
 must be 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.349
 ten centimeters 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.069
 the finish can also be done with a treasure of ordinary plate 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:42.690
 during the installation of the tiles 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.430
 the side edges should be turned inward to prevent 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.419
 Water 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:55.239
 the result is a highly efficient and finished stoned water 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.239
 Perfect 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.229
 for anyone who prefers stolen water can also be installed 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.349
 broken for this 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.249
 just make the head arm pain cloud the central key
