00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.480
 So No Hen mix 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 The last time I did not fly a bit, I tried to scratch the school scratch 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.280
 I would like to put the continuation of the mix 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.690
 That went before 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.780
 Match the tempo of the song 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.370
 It is important to remove the tempo of the song 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.440
 I really don't like it on the first night 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.920
 That is to say whether or not put out 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.320
 so 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.390
 It is a part to connect 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.870
 Connect using any part of the song 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.400
 For example, cover the intro part of the next song in the part of the chorus of the song 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.220
 The solve before Hatachi 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.240
 Conversion development 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.240
 In the expansion part 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.320
 It began to draw Co. 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.320
 Well recently a little 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.560
 Also a method to say Sabisabu from rust gone skip such a intro Toka Bath minutes 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.480
 I often go around but basically 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.480
 There is a form that covers the rust and the pharynx 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.940
 Just the most pleasant place 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.600
 It is to connect 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.600
 In today to try 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.580
 Run ran 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.310
 I will put jis 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.530
 I would like to try this song for a try 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 Of course, at first you adjust the speed of the station 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.869
 Tea travel in a good place to write here 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.430
 so 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.870
 The first song to come in next 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 I already lowered it and cut it 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.090
 The volume is rising and the sound is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.759
 The day when it has flowed once before 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.759
