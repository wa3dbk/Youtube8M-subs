mine ok welcome back if you had a go so

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.670 
mine ok welcome back if you had a go so
first<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.120> all<00:00:41.239> what<00:00:41.420> I'm<00:00:41.510> going<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.839> do<00:00:42.019> is<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
first of all what I'm going to do is to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.160 
first of all what I'm going to do is to
define<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:43.910> complex<00:00:44.390> number<00:00:44.719> I'm<00:00:44.989> just

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
define this complex number I'm just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.979 
define this complex number I'm just
going<00:00:45.289> to<00:00:45.320> say<00:00:45.530> let<00:00:45.829> Z<00:00:46.219> be<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:47.420> complex

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
going to say let Z be that complex

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.860 
going to say let Z be that complex
number<00:00:48.730> Z<00:00:49.730> equals<00:00:50.300> minus<00:00:50.750> 2<00:00:51.289> plus<00:00:51.920> 2<00:00:52.629> 3i<00:00:53.629> and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
number Z equals minus 2 plus 2 3i and

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.049 
number Z equals minus 2 plus 2 3i and
what<00:00:56.870> I'm<00:00:56.989> also<00:00:57.170> going<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.680> do<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.160> draw<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
what I'm also going to do is draw a

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.869 
what I'm also going to do is draw a
sketch<00:00:59.420> then<00:00:59.480> on<00:01:00.109> an<00:01:00.620> Argand<00:01:00.980> diagram<00:01:01.219> of<00:01:01.820> that

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
sketch then on an Argand diagram of that

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.529 
sketch then on an Argand diagram of that
complex<00:01:02.600> number<00:01:03.009> so<00:01:04.009> what<00:01:04.580> we've<00:01:04.759> got<00:01:04.970> then<00:01:05.269> is

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
complex number so what we've got then is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.800 
complex number so what we've got then is
our<00:01:06.289> real<00:01:07.009> axis<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.350> our<00:01:09.350> imaginary<00:01:10.130> axis<00:01:10.810> so

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
our real axis and our imaginary axis so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.109 
our real axis and our imaginary axis so
when<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.050> comes<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.530> labeling<00:01:13.130> our<00:01:13.340> complex

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
when it comes to labeling our complex

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.080 
when it comes to labeling our complex
numbers<00:01:14.570> ed<00:01:14.810> said<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.590> going<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:15.920> 2<00:01:16.549> units

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
numbers ed said is going to be 2 units

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.410 
numbers ed said is going to be 2 units
to<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.509> left<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.170> 2<00:01:18.860> root<00:01:19.130> 3<00:01:19.240> units

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
to the left and 2 root 3 units

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.990 
to the left and 2 root 3 units
upwards<00:01:20.960> okay<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.680> it's<00:01:22.340> going<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.549> look<00:01:22.729> say

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
upwards okay so it's going to look say

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.130 
upwards okay so it's going to look say
something<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.070> if<00:01:25.189> I<00:01:25.400> draw<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.720> a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
something like that and if I draw in a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.230 
something like that and if I draw in a
triangle<00:01:27.740> just<00:01:27.770> complete<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:28.579> right<00:01:28.790> angle

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
triangle just complete this right angle

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.380 
triangle just complete this right angle
triangle<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:30.439> we<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:30.860> got<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:31.400> is<00:01:31.640> 2

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
triangle what we have got then is 2

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.640 
triangle what we have got then is 2
units<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.829> way<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:35.119> boot<00:01:35.720> three<00:01:36.079> units

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
units this way and to boot three units

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.420 
units this way and to boot three units
up<00:01:38.049> complete<00:01:39.049> this<00:01:39.320> by<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:39.740> putting<00:01:40.220> an

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
up complete this by just putting an

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.160 
up complete this by just putting an
arrow<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.299> I'm<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.689> call<00:01:42.140> that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
arrow on here and I'm going to call that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.910 
arrow on here and I'm going to call that
said<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.729> when<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.970> comes<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.720> working<00:01:45.229> out<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
said so when it comes to working out the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.319 
said so when it comes to working out the
modulus<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.119> Z<00:01:47.350> which<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.890> R<00:01:49.280> value<00:01:49.640> here

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
modulus of Z which is the R value here

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.580 
modulus of Z which is the R value here
then<00:01:51.110> we<00:01:51.860> use<00:01:52.189> Pythagoras<00:01:53.060> theorem<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
then we use Pythagoras theorem the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.690 
then we use Pythagoras theorem the
modulus<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.219> Z<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:56.680> going<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.829> be<00:01:58.130> equal<00:01:58.670> to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
modulus of Z is going to be equal to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.389 
modulus of Z is going to be equal to
square<00:01:59.360> root<00:01:59.570> then<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.950> sum<00:02:01.219> of<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
square root then of the sum of the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.280 
square root then of the sum of the
squares<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> two<00:02:02.240> sides<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.170> going

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
squares of the two sides so it's going

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.030 
squares of the two sides so it's going
to<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.469> 2<00:02:03.680> squared<00:02:04.100> plus<00:02:04.880> 2<00:02:05.409> root<00:02:06.409> 3<00:02:06.799> all

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
to be 2 squared plus 2 root 3 all

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.660 
to be 2 squared plus 2 root 3 all
squared<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.200> work<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.590> out<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.489> end

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
squared and if you work this out you end

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.420 
squared and if you work this out you end
up<00:02:10.850> with<00:02:11.320> 4<00:02:12.320> here<00:02:12.709> plus<00:02:13.610> 12<00:02:14.480> here<00:02:14.870> total<00:02:15.829> of<00:02:15.890> 16

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
up with 4 here plus 12 here total of 16

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.009 
up with 4 here plus 12 here total of 16
and<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.790> got<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> root<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.450> 16<00:02:17.989> which<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.440> 4

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
and you got the root of 16 which is 4

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.720 
and you got the root of 16 which is 4
don't<00:02:21.019> forget<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.350> don't<00:02:21.530> need<00:02:21.739> plus<00:02:22.100> or<00:02:22.340> minus

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
don't forget we don't need plus or minus

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.400 
don't forget we don't need plus or minus
here<00:02:22.910> when<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.209> modulus<00:02:23.900> we

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
here when it's modulus we

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.910 
here when it's modulus we
just<00:02:24.560> take<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.860> positive<00:02:25.010> value<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> that's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
just take the positive value so that's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
just take the positive value so that's
the<00:02:28.130> modulus<00:02:28.600> next<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:29.780> need<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.380> arm<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
the modulus next we need the arm of the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940 
the modulus next we need the arm of the
complex<00:02:32.390> number<00:02:32.750> said<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.680> will<00:02:33.800> be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
complex number said and that will be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.820 
complex number said and that will be
this<00:02:34.130> angle<00:02:34.430> round<00:02:35.210> here<00:02:35.750> okay<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.560> will<00:02:36.770> be

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
this angle round here okay this will be

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.600 
this angle round here okay this will be
the<00:02:37.340> arc<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:38.540> said<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:40.160> work<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.580> out

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the arc of said and to work that out

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.550 
the arc of said and to work that out
what<00:02:40.940> I'm<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.270> do<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.720> work<00:02:42.110> out<00:02:42.380> what

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
what I'm going to do is work out what

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860 
what I'm going to do is work out what
this<00:02:42.770> acute<00:02:43.430> angle<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:44.600> I'm<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
this acute angle is in here I'm going to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.910 
this acute angle is in here I'm going to
call<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.200> theta<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.690> we<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
call it theta and we can see that the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.000 
call it theta and we can see that the
tan<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.460> theta<00:02:49.490> would<00:02:50.300> be<00:02:50.360> 2<00:02:50.750> root<00:02:50.990> 3<00:02:51.050> over<00:02:51.620> 2

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
tan of theta would be 2 root 3 over 2

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.950 
tan of theta would be 2 root 3 over 2
opposite<00:02:52.880> over<00:02:53.180> adjacent

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
opposite over adjacent

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.760 
opposite over adjacent
and<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.860> therefore<00:02:55.190> theta<00:02:55.880> would<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:56.780> equal<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
and so therefore theta would be equal to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.100 
and so therefore theta would be equal to
the<00:02:58.670> inverse<00:02:59.000> tan<00:02:59.690> of<00:03:01.000> 2<00:03:02.000> root<00:03:02.240> 3<00:03:02.800> over<00:03:03.800> 2<00:03:05.110> and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the inverse tan of 2 root 3 over 2 and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.220 
the inverse tan of 2 root 3 over 2 and
if<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.290> work<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.740> out<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.670> comes<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.510> PI

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
if you work this out this comes to PI

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.790 
if you work this out this comes to PI
upon<00:03:09.430> 3<00:03:10.430> radians<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.450> equivalent<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:12.080> 60

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
upon 3 radians the equivalent of 60

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.620 
upon 3 radians the equivalent of 60
degrees<00:03:13.190> if<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.580> degrees<00:03:13.910> mode<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.450> make<00:03:14.600> sure

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
degrees if in degrees mode so make sure

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.110 
degrees if in degrees mode so make sure
you're<00:03:14.960> in<00:03:15.040> radians<00:03:16.040> mode<00:03:16.160> when<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.760> do<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you're in radians mode when you do the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.920 
you're in radians mode when you do the
inverse<00:03:17.510> tan<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.530> value<00:03:19.450> okay<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.510> that's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
inverse tan of this value okay so that's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.020 
inverse tan of this value okay so that's
theta<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.950> therefore<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:23.000> arc<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:24.500> Z<00:03:25.000> will<00:03:26.000> be

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
theta so therefore the arc of Z will be

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
theta so therefore the arc of Z will be
equal<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.459> pi<00:03:28.940> radians<00:03:29.510> half<00:03:29.870> a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
equal to well that's pi radians half a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.270 
equal to well that's pi radians half a
turn<00:03:30.320> PI<00:03:30.950> minus<00:03:31.550> PI<00:03:32.000> upon<00:03:32.030> 3<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.650> be<00:03:33.800> 2

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
turn PI minus PI upon 3 is going to be 2

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.590 
turn PI minus PI upon 3 is going to be 2
pi<00:03:34.610> upon<00:03:34.940> 3<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.840> that's<00:03:36.650> our<00:03:36.890> archive<00:03:37.370> said<00:03:37.610> so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
pi upon 3 so that's our archive said so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.170 
pi upon 3 so that's our archive said so
we're<00:03:38.840> now<00:03:38.959> going<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.200> put<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
we're now going to put this then in the

we're now going to put this then in the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
mod art form r is the mod and theta then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.850 
mod art form r is the mod and theta then
is<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.040> arc<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.940> therefore<00:03:47.690> we<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:48.620> wind

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
is the arc so therefore we just wind

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.020 
is the arc so therefore we just wind
this<00:03:49.010> up<00:03:49.220> we've<00:03:49.520> got<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:50.209> minus<00:03:50.780> 2<00:03:50.810> plus<00:03:51.500> 2

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
this up we've got that minus 2 plus 2

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.050 
this up we've got that minus 2 plus 2
