00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 after 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 so it started the elections and maybe some of them are still 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.890
 some questions to their needs given 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.790
 some elements to take into consideration first of all the stakes 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.880
 elections is not to know who will go with whom or against who it is 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.270
 to know what we want to do with our society of tomorrow is to know how 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.270
 we want to handle this crisis continues to protect people 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.930
 it's also knowing what is the post-crisis society that we want 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.579
 society a lot more humanism blow more lasting that left on the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060
 human capital on education education 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.870
 on economic development but with a human face where the economy is at 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.560
 service of the man and not the opposite 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.500
 they made us the environmental revolution we need it's 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.810
 it's the mistakes and challenges of tomorrow it is behind all these issues 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.430
 a deep will put the values â€‹â€‹values â€‹â€‹of the heart and morocco 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.850
 center of everything and I think to carry such an ambitious project but 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.680
 also humanist we need both teams to the net beyond all 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 suspicion we had mimicry of politicians who never 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.460
 had a case no issue of stability for five years 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.100
 that we need people who have sense meaning value of interest 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.580
 general and who want to make politics so 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.260
 selfless and sincerely just 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.030
 we need competent people in I see that all the ministers ceded to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 change with a lot of intelligence they have been they can appreciate and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.020
 they have the best odds and they have worked tremendously without putting themselves 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.210
 forward because that's also a feature of the severe I think about 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.830
 modesty and then and most importantly 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 you know well that two years ago and that a year ago that a few months ago 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.880
 you could count on us very clearly in a very 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.110
 firm and convinced way to protect you francophones from 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.650
 ambitions of the Flemish claims unacceptable as much we are ready 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.840
 to discuss a reasonable state reform as much you will always 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.790
 rely on us to say no to unacceptable claims to the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.200
 split of the country 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.190
 or fadela national unity or at least federal belgium 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.189

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.829
