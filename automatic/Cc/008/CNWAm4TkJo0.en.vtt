00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.390
 Hi 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.969
 yo guests a very good day everyone 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.990
 idea and today what the actual fuck got 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.110
 me again 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.390
 this is burnout take down 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.830
 holy shit yes i have this game on one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 playstation 2 and I have a playstation 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.539
 2 just connected to the pvr 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.359
 and we go burnout makes sense 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.150
 burn out then stick by jaap after take 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.500
 down so let us do it for a while 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.730
 let's see where we can pack 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 have a gigantic speed here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.920
 cars to that this motherfucker 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.930
 and for the people who don't know what 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 because burn-out take down is a must 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.180
 really just your opponent 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.010
 try to knock down and race 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 win and you had more chance like me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 do it now 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 just by putting them against the wall 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.350
 rams 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 and that's so fucking epic i think it is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.059
 so really really good because he 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.949
 is again take-down car two in a row 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.859
 take down i'm a mother fucking money 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.530
 to we this game is really antiquity 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.470
 just this is really such a good material 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
 green to play and I thought he popped up 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.939
 is trying to connect to a playstation 2 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 close to watch my television or that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.990
 succeeds and it succeeded and I have too 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.390
 got connected to a hd pvr again 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.150
 that thoughts playstation 2 on ma de pvr 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 and i thought we are going to mix it bit 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.470
 we just go into antiquity 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 and do old-fashioned games because of this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 is of course epic 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.850
 oh yes i was there anti doubt dude 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.280
 9 started talking , of course you have too 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.930
 so radio station on this game oh no that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.750
 is very cunt 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.549
 just impact time ok so now I can 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 move myself so that I am against other 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.430
 flies in that does not work anymore because comes 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.920
 no one along okay 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.030
 cuddle wall that was a failure we go there 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.860
 Try again to see if we 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.689
 We can look at what I know now 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.079
 that cross of gas is okay squares 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.740
 brakes 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.119
 pretty obvious that's that old shit that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.680
 is very different from the playstation 3 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.969
 controls 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.659
 but i don't know what the image looks like 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.960
 looks like eh yes the playstation 2 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.000
 and the image is not very good 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.259
 record then say again because there are like 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.510
 the good is black bars 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.310
 if it's good if it's bad black 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
 beam here on the side 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.659
 and of course that the super annoying 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 so i tried it i think to get one 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.489
 little bit to know I am not sure if 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.049
 I did that but I think so 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.700
 because someone said that via skype 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.680
 you have to try to bleach the image 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.709
 because it is much less me 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.159
 at least that is much less bad 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.049
 but this game is really huge old 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.200
 wall sauces okay because I like him 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.959
 on the wall and on say the game 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.639
 That can be quite difficult due to 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.230
 don't underestimate it anyway because according to 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.239
 to me this is such a typical game that if you 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.889
 very bad driving that is now over 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.150
 very poorly conductive opponents 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.769
 what you race against 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.060
 but as soon as you go really well then 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.819
 the others also go very well 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.169
 me and that's pretty fucking 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.269
 difficult 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.069
 I call him try and take down 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.430
 hoppekee that's how you do it 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.900
 now take down bitch that is dead 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.849
 oh and by the way with a take down a goes 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.669
 Also not your whole group rate swarm all 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.120
 full so that is super chill 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:16.469
 so it's really super handy 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.930
 yes to basically a 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.000
 make sure you just get your opponents 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.560
 pop just as were really really broken 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.489
 because you get a speedo for that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.949
 So 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.239
 and so speed bonus is fuckin yellow and 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.099
 burnout there are many 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.129
 different things in it really isn't 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.479
 only your race it is also a collision 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.370
 cause and try as much as possible 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.720
 get points there 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.519
 so by the way the final round so me 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.949
 must look around you for a moment 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.540
 look behind you again what is behind you 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.579
 look 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.109
 no idea what looking behind me is but 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.400
 I want to look behind me because I want 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.919
 know how far the and m something from mine 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.109
 be damned alone i can't stand it 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.340
 look at me that's cunt 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.030
 after a bit there should just be the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.549
 race wants to win quickly venus first square 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.840
 that's how you do guys best round 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.229
 of course, because the mold is first game 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.189
 again on burnout take mother 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.829
 fucking 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.120
 down and despise later if you do this more often 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.579
 want to see because i think it's one i have 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.290
 game playstation 2 games are fucking 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.840
 did i fuckin divinely 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.430
 boys from watching gold medal 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.269
 oh you do for looking at the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.889
 next time 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.639
 giant and know that if you want it often 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.639
 see water
