00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.389
 Most applications you install request access permissions: 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.180
 your location, your calls or your messages for example, without necessarily 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.469
 need it to work. If you are concerned about your privacy, 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.160
 Fortunately, there are applications. I'm Thomas from Android MT and we'll see 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.050
 together how to control the permissions of your apps without rooting the mobile 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.690
 with Advanced Permission Manager. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.620
 Advanced Permission Manager can display all the permissions requested by 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.500
 each of your applications and explain their consequences 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 possible. Taking for example this flashlight app that does not need 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.640
 to know the identity of the phone, our position, or even 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.140
 communicate with the network. To delete them, simply check the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.610
 permissions that you want to remove from the application before clicking 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.170
 "Save and reinstall". 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.270
 Advanced Permission Manager will actually create an APK of the application. he is 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.210
 so required for this to work to uninstall the original 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.270
 by pressing "Uninstall". 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.880
 When done, press "Install". You can also check 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.960
 that the right permissions, the ones you have left, now appear on the application. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 here it remains to verify that the application works even 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.470
 after removing the permissions you wanted to delete. 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.630
 Attention, according to the permissions you delete with Advanced Permission manager, 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.300
 the application may no longer work. Do not hesitate to do 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.280
 try to find the ones you can delete. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.440
 So much for this tutorial on Advanced Permission Manager! Stay tuned on 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.450
