going to think you're going to get that
flavor<00:03:17.310> you're<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:18.299> with<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.890> this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
flavor you're really not with with this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.800 
flavor you're really not with with this
piece<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.310> equipment<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.269> nice<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
piece of equipment but it is nice if you

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.970 
piece of equipment but it is nice if you
want<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.989> get<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.200> smoky<00:03:22.500> flavor<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.920> you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
want to get that smoky flavor and you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640 
want to get that smoky flavor and you
don't<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.310> big<00:03:23.700> industrial<00:03:24.269> smoker<00:03:24.650> this
