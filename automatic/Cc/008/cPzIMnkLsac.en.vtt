00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
alright now there's not much lace on the

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.849 
alright now there's not much lace on the
unit<00:01:26.149> there's<00:01:26.389> only<00:01:26.659> like<00:01:26.990> half<00:01:27.319> an<00:01:27.530> inch<00:01:27.709> of

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
unit there's only like half an inch of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.109 
unit there's only like half an inch of
lace<00:01:28.240> at<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.539> perimeter<00:01:30.079> of<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.590> unit<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.939> I

lace at the perimeter of the unit and I

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.080 
lace at the perimeter of the unit and I
guess<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.479> main<00:01:32.630> focus<00:01:33.139> is<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.069> part<00:01:34.369> so

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
guess the main focus is the part so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.149 
guess the main focus is the part so
let's<00:01:35.299> try<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.659> on<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.380> see<00:01:36.679> what<00:01:36.829> she<00:01:37.009> looks
