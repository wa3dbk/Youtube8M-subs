 and again the theme is classic and semi 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'll tell you some nuances about the half 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.980
 and before that I want to say yesterday 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 I watched the movie and I was very impressed 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 so how would you like this announcement to you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 I give you a look please and now about 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 axis means the bearing I usually cut 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.609
 see grinder also first for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:04.309
 bearing bush and then bearing 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:09.450
 but the bearing can and be removed carefully and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.460
 easy I ran into it why you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.090
 I want to make a video of this half-line, I decided 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 repair before bought new bearing 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 new gate valve because 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.850
 Shut-off tucano single cut 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 bearing here grinder 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.210
 easy well all this I cut it in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.920
 side now immediately took and on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 extruded new bearing 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 not thinking and not the very one not looking 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.020
 as it is not analyzed and then 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.420
 I take for not he dangles the bearing 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 then here he is gone tight well she with 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.860
 the seat began to hang out i 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.689
 did not look here it is just this 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 bearing inner bearing she 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.240
 cranked when I was driving down the road 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.189
 such a person heard Christ such a thing 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.689
 seems to have passed by some kind of stone 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.450
 I understood this moment then but 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.320
 I cranked and it is this inner will 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.480
 and she just started to slide on 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.480
 semi-axes that is, she and and washed semi-axes 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.640
 but the bearing was already pressed 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 and if it was an old bearing I would have it 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.260
 cut so new bearing sorry you need 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.410
 I had to take it off because I later 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 here already bought a half axis one you ear 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.560
 and just ask for this new one 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.480
 bearing yes I'm going to the car 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.320
 it's like I have a fallback 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.240
 I like everything to be as if 2 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.550
 I have something left with a hollow axis 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.980
 that I now have the spare change it 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.470
 and all and then study now I go a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.000
 it did 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:04.380
 so I took here such a puller because it 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.360
 so I knocked even visible bearing 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:15.210
 traces of the bearing as he acted i'm here 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 so took it pasted on here these little corners 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.020
 I screwed and I have obtained solid 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.030
 put the axle so on some 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.910
 elevations in this case on brick 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.700
 just set and pounded on top of the floor 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.860
 washi tried to compress it like this 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.370
 it should in principle have been reached yes it 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.990
 bearing that's up to this neck half and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:48.930
 stall and neither there nor here 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:54.280
 but it was necessary to remove all the same and then 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:58.480
 I thought and understood that you can shoot him down 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.260
 quite differently for that made me even 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.670
 did not take just such a chicken 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.040

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.640
 half shaft up to bearing pressed again 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.730
 to my place because so understood when 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.850
 I knocked this device she 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.990
 just and water warp in the original 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.480
