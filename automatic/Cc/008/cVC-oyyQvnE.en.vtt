00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
is a great new out the front OTF knife

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.330 
is a great new out the front OTF knife
by<00:00:21.330> HK<00:00:23.000> it<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.269> very<00:00:24.510> similar<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> ultra

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
by HK it is very similar to the ultra

by HK it is very similar to the ultra
tech<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:26.880> micro<00:00:27.330> tech<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.840> far<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.380> size<00:00:28.740> that's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.089 
tech by micro tech as far as size that's
probably<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.699> i<00:00:29.730> would<00:00:29.939> compare<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
probably what i would compare it to

it has no glass breaker like most of the
ultra<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> micro<00:00:38.550> tech<00:00:38.730> OTS<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:42.530> blade

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
ultra the micro tech OTS have but blade

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.150 
ultra the micro tech OTS have but blade
length<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.390> almost<00:00:45.390> identical<00:00:45.920> right<00:00:46.920> about

3.4<00:00:47.969> inches<00:00:48.270> long<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:50.280> probably<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
3.4 inches long you can probably see it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.860 
3.4 inches long you can probably see it
there<00:00:52.910> what<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> turmoil

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there what I like about the turmoil

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.389 
there what I like about the turmoil
versus<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:56.430> H&amp;K<00:00:57.059> OTF<00:00:58.399> specifically

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
versus the other H&amp;K OTF specifically

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.849 
versus the other H&amp;K OTF specifically
the<00:00:59.579> tumult<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:01.170> has<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> drop-point

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the tumult this has got a drop-point

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
the tumult this has got a drop-point
blade<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.760> Tumulty<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.480> clip<00:01:03.809> point

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
blade that Tumulty has a clip point

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.640 
blade that Tumulty has a clip point
blade<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> knife<00:01:07.409> its

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
blade so I really like this knife its

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
blade so I really like this knife its
light<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.220> feels<00:01:08.430> lighter<00:01:08.790> than<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
light it feels lighter than any of the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
light it feels lighter than any of the
others<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.290> even<00:01:10.530> feels<00:01:10.680> lighter<00:01:11.280> than<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
others it even feels lighter than this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
others it even feels lighter than this
ultra<00:01:12.000> tech<00:01:12.210> um<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:14.010> 3

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ultra tech um I think it's just over 3

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.679 
ultra tech um I think it's just over 3
ounces<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.159> differs<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> tumult<00:01:18.330> which

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ounces it differs from the tumult which

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.899 
ounces it differs from the tumult which
I<00:01:18.840> don't<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.650> me<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I don't have one with me now but the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
I don't have one with me now but the
that<00:01:21.420> tumult<00:01:22.259> handle<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.740> smooth<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.310> one

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that tumult handle is smooth this one

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.170 
that tumult handle is smooth this one
has<00:01:23.700> significant<00:01:25.549> ribbing<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> both<00:01:26.880> sides

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
has significant ribbing on both sides

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
has significant ribbing on both sides
and<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.009> on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> front<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.579> end<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
sides of the handle the the blade is d2

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.319

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
black anodized aluminum handle the the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
black anodized aluminum handle the the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
thumb slide is on the on the right side

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.819 
thumb slide is on the on the right side
right<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.740> mean<00:01:53.930> effortless

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.670 

it's<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.549> easy<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:01.290> say<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's just really easy I can't say the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.999 
it's just really easy I can't say the
same<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:01.920> micro<00:02:02.430> Tech's<00:02:03.079> while<00:02:04.079> they're<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
same for micro Tech's while they're you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.859 
same for micro Tech's while they're you
know<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.430> favorite<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.570> you've

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
know one of my favorite and if you've

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
know one of my favorite and if you've
been<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.290> site<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> love<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
been to my site you know I love it I

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.470 
been to my site you know I love it I
love<00:02:08.670> micro<00:02:09.030> tech<00:02:09.209> stuff<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.560> very

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
love micro tech stuff but they are very

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.170 
love micro tech stuff but they are very
very<00:02:12.480> hard<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.840> retract

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
very hard to retract

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.460 
very hard to retract
with<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.420> thumb<00:02:15.660> unless<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.230> really

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
with one thumb unless you have really

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.740 
with one thumb unless you have really
strong<00:02:16.709> hands<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.790> loosen<00:02:18.209> up<00:02:18.330> over<00:02:18.540> time

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
strong hands they do loosen up over time

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.089 
strong hands they do loosen up over time
but<00:02:19.020> right<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.560> box

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
but right out the box

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.600 
but right out the box
they're<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.000> stiff<00:02:22.069> difficult<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.160> use<00:02:23.370> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
they're very stiff difficult to use this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.820 
they're very stiff difficult to use this
one<00:02:23.819> however<00:02:25.010> as<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.130> can<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:27.830> think

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
one however as you can see I think

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.650 
one however as you can see I think
Microtech<00:02:29.550> has<00:02:29.730> stiffened<00:02:29.970> their<00:02:30.269> Springs

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
Microtech has stiffened their Springs

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.410 
Microtech has stiffened their Springs
quite<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.050> bit<00:02:31.260> over<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> last<00:02:31.860> year<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
quite a bit over the last year to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.800 
quite a bit over the last year to
