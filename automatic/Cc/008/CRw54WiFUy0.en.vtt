the torque is what counts in
acceleration<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.540> motorways<00:02:01.900> in<00:02:02.290> overtaking

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
acceleration on motorways in overtaking

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.160 
acceleration on motorways in overtaking
if<00:02:03.340> you've<00:02:03.550> got<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.730> talking<00:02:04.000> car<00:02:04.300> that's<00:02:04.930> one

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
if you've got a talking car that's one

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.480 
if you've got a talking car that's one
that<00:02:05.290> will<00:02:05.410> win<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.259> got<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> BMW<00:02:08.979> 320d

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
that will win so it's got the BMW 320d

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.030 
that will win so it's got the BMW 320d
beat<00:02:09.910> on<00:02:10.149> power<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.570> torque<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:11.830> there's<00:02:11.950> one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
beat on power and torque but there's one

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.060 
beat on power and torque but there's one
problem<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.330> eats<00:02:13.630> fat<00:02:14.140> it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
problem of the is and that eats fat it's

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.510 
problem of the is and that eats fat it's
got<00:02:15.340> about<00:02:15.610> 150<00:02:16.450> kilo<00:02:17.170> deficit<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.830> 320d

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
got about 150 kilo deficit on the 320d

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.610 
got about 150 kilo deficit on the 320d
which<00:02:18.670> makes<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.120> almost<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.990> second<00:02:20.410> slower

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
which makes it almost a second slower

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280 
which makes it almost a second slower
262<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> comes<00:02:22.300> down<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> your<00:02:22.780> choice<00:02:23.020> do

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
262 so it comes down to your choice do

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.900
