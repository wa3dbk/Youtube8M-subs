 riabkov 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 once Upon a time 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.680
 a king who had a wife with golden hair 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.030
 and it was so beautiful because there was no other like 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.020
 it's not interesting that we just need your dog's description to 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.120
 imagine its beauty and if we think for a moment about ash-white snow white the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.690
 sleeping beauty or rapunzel for her perfect fit the first thing that 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.970
 we remember 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.790
 because it generates but it is strange magnetism that from small attracts us 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 fascinated 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.640
 or is it that someone imagines one of them with baldness problems 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 in chiva for example 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 destroyer god of the Hindu trinity 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.910
 because in his abundant hair of origin of the most sacred of the rivers in Cascais 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.520
 it's no wonder that the Yankees got their hair like 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680
 detained natural essence half 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 but in the west 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.210
 it seems that the hair has played another role 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.230
 in that witness of eternal conflicts 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.260
 whether they are Romanians against barbados conquerors against indigenous 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.150
 cowboys against Indians the constant struggle of the war against the underworld 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.980
 but moving away a bit this reality 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.290
 of them has also been the representative symbol of many characters and 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 fiction heroes 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.570
 / to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.650
 we are always arranging in the center 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.280
 it's the first thing we do when we wake up it's almost an instinct to see us in front of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.320
 a mirror when we are facing someone we like or when we prepare 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.469
 for an important meeting 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.119
 nothing 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.680
 mumbru hair 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.800
 It has invariably been a success of our greatest care and attention 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 in ancient times it was a symbol of vitality and sensuality 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.959
 indicator of dignity and social status 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.849
 and today when we see ourselves reflected on television we could say that nothing 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 of this has changed 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.809
 famous models 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.959
 artists, musicians, political actors 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.379
 we could imagine other inmates 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.599
 ask for more preposterous 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.729
 on the fourth time 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.059
 one of them 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.139
 noted that moves her so neither conciliatory 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.139
 mÃ³nica cervera 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.630
 eccentricities appearances ideologies insane fashions by status 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.780
 this can not be defined by the way we wear our hair 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.839
 and that in addition to the reforms roberto rivera 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.669

 Wed 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.249
 many times they gave it to me 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.669
 the leader 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.669
 flamini has been declared of euros 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.110

 ace 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.730
 in very good 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.500
 wait 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 but it arrives 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.869
 head music is a world the eyes are the mirror of the soul 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.580
 the hair would not be your bank 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 the algeciras cadiz 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.979
 disaster 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.020
 I do not know why I like it 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 I think it's a hair 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.409
 lionel messi 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.870
 obviously it was nothing abnormal 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.870
 instead of the hand 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.180
 no no and now the other 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.499
 as a speaker 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.849
 there are many more people 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.849
 thousands of employees of gm 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.749
 nerves and emotion all the 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:09.729
 the first half of the year 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.289
 after the two goals 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.289
 normal 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.339
 the Spanish coach 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.459
 migoya counselor claims to be a little bit by the hoop they 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.249
 third was the expired 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.309
 they have everything you like 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.259
 also in that state 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.949
 we have ever gone through the anguished martyrdom of cutting ourselves off 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:42.860
 hair 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.059
 always with the first one, it's a matter of who you think 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:47.089
 and of course 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.089
 many times we have repented 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.199
 now they do not have it 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.360
 in each state 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.360
 because it affects us so much a bad haircut 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.169
 a huge Galician branch 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:11.259
 For me it is very important 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:14.259
 isinbayeva that was in the house 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.479
 first national b 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.479
 they wanted way day 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.050
 once they are finished 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.889
 I was attracted to the power 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.729
 she has denied 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.729
 after winning today 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:52.529
 I do not care 

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.300
 the myth of this hair 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.300
 where is it going to stop 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.789
 who want 

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:07.449
