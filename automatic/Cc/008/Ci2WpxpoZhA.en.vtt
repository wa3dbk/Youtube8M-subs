so I really love that it's pleated I
don't<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.630> Sun<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
don't know if it's it like the Sun is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
don't know if it's it like the Sun is
going<00:02:01.170> down<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.369> filming

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
going down so it's and I'm like filming

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.859 
going down so it's and I'm like filming
and<00:02:02.850> natural<00:02:03.119> light<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> hard<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> see

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and natural light so it's hard to see

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.800 
and natural light so it's hard to see
what<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> pleated<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.750> of
