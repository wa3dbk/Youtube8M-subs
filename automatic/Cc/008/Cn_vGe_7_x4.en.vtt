these automatic garage door openers in

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.379 
these automatic garage door openers in
your<00:00:10.230> garage<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.910> happens<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
have one of these beams which goes along

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.510 
have one of these beams which goes along
the<00:00:15.210> bottom<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> from<00:00:17.400> my

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the bottom of it so from my

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.920 
the bottom of it so from my
understanding<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.150> what<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.359> beam<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.570> put

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
understanding of what that beam is put

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.660 
understanding of what that beam is put
there<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> door<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.130> never<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
there so that the door is never going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
there so that the door is never going to
come<00:00:20.820> down<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> close<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.810> someone's<00:00:22.199> foot

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
come down and close on someone's foot

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.840 
come down and close on someone's foot
what<00:00:22.980> they're<00:00:23.070> having<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> put<00:00:23.519> their<00:00:23.640> foot

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
what they're having to put their foot

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
what they're having to put their foot
there<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.289> also<00:00:25.439> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> protect<00:00:25.920> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
there and it's also going to protect it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.529 
there and it's also going to protect it
if<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.430> happen<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> put<00:00:26.970> some<00:00:27.180> sort<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> an

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
if they happen to put some sort of an

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
if they happen to put some sort of an
item<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> path<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> garage<00:00:28.769> door

item in the path of the garage door

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790 
item in the path of the garage door
because<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> door<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.420> close<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
because the door will not close if that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
because the door will not close if that
beam<00:00:32.070> isn't<00:00:32.430> broken<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.750> nothing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
beam isn't broken well I have nothing

beam isn't broken well I have nothing
against<00:00:34.290> safety<00:00:34.710> features<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.160> think<00:00:35.190> safety

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
against safety features I think safety

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
against safety features I think safety
is<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.149> important<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.840> safety

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is really important and this safety

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.900 
is really important and this safety
feature<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.860> fact<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.579> actually

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
feature in fact I think is actually

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
feature in fact I think is actually
really<00:00:39.120> useful<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:40.559> know<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> good

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really useful you know it's a good

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
really useful you know it's a good
chance<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.579> save<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.120> getting

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
chance it's gonna save you from getting

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
chance it's gonna save you from getting
hurt<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.500> also<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.860> save<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.280> from

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
hurt or it's also gonna save you from

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
hurt or it's also gonna save you from
wrecking<00:00:44.940> something<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> accidentally

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
wrecking something that you accidentally

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450 
wrecking something that you accidentally
happen<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> leave<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> path<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.370> your

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
happen to leave in the path for your

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
happen to leave in the path for your
garage<00:00:47.640> door<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.649> about<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
garage door but the one thing about this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
garage door but the one thing about this
safety<00:00:50.309> feature<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> can't<00:00:51.210> stand

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
safety feature which I just can't stand

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
safety feature which I just can't stand
is<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.680> annoying<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.160> beep<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is that annoying little beep that it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
is that annoying little beep that it
makes<00:00:54.180> every<00:00:54.600> single<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> cross

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
makes every single time that you cross

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
makes every single time that you cross
its<00:00:56.460> path<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.809> silly<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.379> me<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
its path it's just so silly to me the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
its path it's just so silly to me the
way<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.280> works<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.879> every

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
way I think this one works is it's every

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
way I think this one works is it's every
5<00:01:00.809> seconds<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> hasn't<00:01:01.829> gone<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
5 seconds if it hasn't gone off if you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.039 
5 seconds if it hasn't gone off if you
leave<00:01:03.210> something<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.870> gonna

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
leave something there it's not gonna

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.190 
leave something there it's not gonna
just<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> constant<00:01:05.430> tone<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
just make a constant tone but it is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
just make a constant tone but it is
gonna<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.500> off<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.799> least<00:01:08.010> every<00:01:08.400> 5<00:01:08.670> seconds

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
gonna go off at least every 5 seconds

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.490 
gonna go off at least every 5 seconds
and<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.720> annoying<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and it's just so annoying if you just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
and it's just so annoying if you just
come<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> garage<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.760> grab<00:01:12.000> something

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
come into the garage to grab something

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
come into the garage to grab something
quickly<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.840> hear<00:01:13.020> beep<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
quickly you hear beep on your way in and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
quickly you hear beep on your way in and
your<00:01:14.670> way<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.210> beep<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.200> again<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
your way back out beep right again just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.420 
your way back out beep right again just
so<00:01:17.310> annoying<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.090> can't<00:01:18.390> understand

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
so annoying I really can't understand

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
so annoying I really can't understand
what<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> safety<00:01:21.090> purpose<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.990> beep

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
what the safety purpose that that beep

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
what the safety purpose that that beep
is<00:01:22.500> therefore<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.159> doesn't<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is therefore it really doesn't do

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
is therefore it really doesn't do
anything<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> feature<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> door

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
anything the feature is that the door

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
anything the feature is that the door
doesn't<00:01:26.159> close<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.820> don't<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
doesn't close you really don't need to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.880 
doesn't close you really don't need to
know<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:27.840> someone<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:28.740> not

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
know that there's someone there or not

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
as long as the door doesn't closed it's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
as long as the door doesn't closed it's
not<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.320> hurt<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.850> video<00:01:33.119> will

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
show you a very simple method of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
show you a very simple method of
disabling<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> beep<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:35.880> happening<00:01:36.390> while

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
disabling the beep from happening while

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380 
disabling the beep from happening while
maintaining<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.920> safety<00:01:38.340> feature<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
maintaining the safety feature so that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
maintaining the safety feature so that
it's<00:01:39.540> still<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.040> job<00:01:41.369> just

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it's still there doing this job just

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's still there doing this job just
without<00:01:42.329> annoying<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> heck<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.680> so

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
without annoying the heck out of you so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
without annoying the heck out of you so
the<00:01:44.310> first<00:01:44.520> step<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the first step you want to do here is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
the first step you want to do here is
figure<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.110> which<00:01:46.470> side<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.280> making<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> beep

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
figure out which side is making the beep

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
figure out which side is making the beep
one<00:01:48.630> side<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> sender<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
one side is the sender this is the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
one side is the sender this is the
sender<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.820> side<00:01:51.060> over<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
sender this side over here is the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
sender this side over here is the
receiver<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.310> speaker<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
receiver and this little speaker that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
receiver and this little speaker that
makes<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> noise<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> two

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
makes the noise is on one of the two

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
makes the noise is on one of the two
sides<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.000> we've<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> figure<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.540> which

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
sides so we've got to figure out which

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
sides so we've got to figure out which
side<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> disable<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.549> speaker

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
side it is so we can disable the speaker

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
side it is so we can disable the speaker
so<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.930> by<00:02:01.049> listening<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
so just by listening to it when you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.219 
so just by listening to it when you
cross<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> beep<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.790> very<00:02:02.969> easy<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> tell<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
cross the beep it's very easy to tell it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.830 
cross the beep it's very easy to tell it
is<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> side<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> has<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.600> speaker

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
is this side here that has the speaker

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
is this side here that has the speaker
inside<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.649> we're<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.280> working

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
inside of it so we're gonna be working

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.150 
inside of it so we're gonna be working
on<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.940> side<00:02:09.179> over<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> before<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> get

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
on this side over here so before you get

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.470 
on this side over here so before you get
started<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> door<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.330> want

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
started over there at the door you want

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.170 
started over there at the door you want
to<00:02:12.569> climb<00:02:12.840> out

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
to climb out

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.229 
to climb out
and<00:02:13.590> unplug<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.799> garage<00:02:15.340> door<00:02:15.700> opener<00:02:16.060> from

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
and unplug the garage door opener from

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.250 
and unplug the garage door opener from
the<00:02:16.420> outlet<00:02:17.049> which<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> up<00:02:17.500> there<00:02:18.989> there<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.140> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the outlet which is up there there it is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.319 
the outlet which is up there there it is
unplugged<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:21.579> it's<00:02:21.790> safe<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.150> work

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
unplugged so now that it's safe to work

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.789 
unplugged so now that it's safe to work
on<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.659> first<00:02:22.810> thing<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.079> want<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.500> here

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
on the first thing you want to do here

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.580 
on the first thing you want to do here
is<00:02:23.970> remove<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.180> from<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> bracket<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:26.230> this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
is remove this from the bracket so this

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.949 
is remove this from the bracket so this
one<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:26.799> has<00:02:27.099> these<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.540> thumb<00:02:28.540> screws

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
one just has these little thumb screws

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.449 
one just has these little thumb screws
which<00:02:29.170> are<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.560> top<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.099> have<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
which are on the top so you have to

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.460 
which are on the top so you have to
loosen<00:02:31.030> those<00:02:31.299> off<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.079> at<00:02:32.260> it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
loosen those off so you can get at it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.140 
loosen those off so you can get at it
and<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:33.189> fact<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.489> don't<00:02:33.579> actually<00:02:33.790> need<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
and in fact I don't actually need it to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.490 
and in fact I don't actually need it to
completely<00:02:34.450> remove<00:02:34.720> values<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.079> to<00:02:35.200> take

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
completely remove values have to take

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.710 
completely remove values have to take
one<00:02:35.680> off<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.189> I'm<00:02:36.819> able<00:02:36.939> to<00:02:37.090> spin<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.599> around

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
one off and I'm able to spin it around

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.569 
one off and I'm able to spin it around
so<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.829> work<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
so that I can work on it just like that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.679 
so that I can work on it just like that
so<00:02:42.579> this<00:02:42.640> one<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:43.000> should<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.359> pretty<00:02:43.599> easy

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
so this one here should be pretty easy

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.410 
so this one here should be pretty easy
to<00:02:44.019> work<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:45.310> got<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> nice<00:02:45.670> backplate<00:02:46.389> on

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
to work on it's got a nice backplate on

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.259 
to work on it's got a nice backplate on
it<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:46.900> all<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.200> got<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.530> do<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.269> stick

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
it so all you really got to do is stick

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.030 
it so all you really got to do is stick
to<00:02:49.480> screwdriver<00:02:50.079> inside<00:02:50.409> those<00:02:50.560> two<00:02:50.769> little

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
to screwdriver inside those two little

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.640 
to screwdriver inside those two little
slots<00:02:51.280> along<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.819> top<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:53.290> whole<00:02:53.409> back

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
slots along the top and the whole back

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.680 
slots along the top and the whole back
part<00:02:53.920> should<00:02:54.159> just<00:02:54.340> pop<00:02:54.579> right<00:02:54.609> off<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.269> then

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
part should just pop right off and then

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.149 
part should just pop right off and then
we<00:02:55.750> should<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.019> able<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.409> inside<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.980> work

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
we should be able to get inside and work

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.089 
we should be able to get inside and work
on<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:58.109> so<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> screwdriver<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.739> goes<00:02:59.950> in

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
on it so the screwdriver just goes in

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.250 
on it so the screwdriver just goes in
there<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> pops<00:03:00.639> a<00:03:00.819> little<00:03:01.030> tab<00:03:01.269> down<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.170> you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
there it pops a little tab down and you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.479 
there it pops a little tab down and you
can<00:03:02.409> pull<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.709> out<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.829> little<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.189> on<00:03:03.280> that

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
can pull it out a little bit on that

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.179 
can pull it out a little bit on that
side<00:03:03.790> do<00:03:04.389> the<00:03:04.450> same<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.019> side<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.620> there

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
side do the same on this side and there

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.599 
side do the same on this side and there
she<00:03:06.370> comes<00:03:06.609> right<00:03:06.819> off<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:09.400> whole

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
she comes right off and then this whole

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.099 
she comes right off and then this whole
little<00:03:09.909> circuit<00:03:10.299> board<00:03:10.329> should<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.900> pull

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
little circuit board should just pull

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.500 
little circuit board should just pull
right<00:03:11.349> out<00:03:11.409> from<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.010> from<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.000> unit<00:03:13.329> there

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
right out from the from the unit there

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.170 
right out from the from the unit there
like<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:15.760> what<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:15.970> circuit

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
like this so that's what the circuit

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.569 
like this so that's what the circuit
board<00:03:16.510> looks<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.959> there<00:03:17.319> you've<00:03:17.889> got<00:03:18.040> an<00:03:18.160> LED

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
board looks like there you've got an LED

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.009 
board looks like there you've got an LED
light<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> bottom<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:19.510> which<00:03:19.660> tells

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
light at the bottom there which tells

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.659 
light at the bottom there which tells
you<00:03:20.199> whether<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.560> beam<00:03:20.739> has<00:03:20.919> been<00:03:21.069> crossed<00:03:21.430> or

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
you whether the beam has been crossed or

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.699 
you whether the beam has been crossed or
not<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:22.629> there's<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.900> black<00:03:23.199> thing<00:03:23.590> up

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
not and then there's this black thing up

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.809 
not and then there's this black thing up
here<00:03:23.859> which<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.280> looks<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:24.489> an<00:03:24.669> LED

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
here which kind of looks like an LED

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.500 
here which kind of looks like an LED
which<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.359> believe<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:27.209> receiver<00:03:28.209> which

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
which I believe is the receiver which

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.449 
which I believe is the receiver which
that<00:03:29.230> which<00:03:29.500> senses<00:03:29.919> whether<00:03:30.099> there's<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
that which senses whether there's a

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.180 
that which senses whether there's a
laser<00:03:30.760> beam<00:03:31.060> pointed<00:03:31.750> at<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.049> or<00:03:32.169> not<00:03:32.409> when<00:03:33.159> I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
laser beam pointed at it or not when I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.589 
laser beam pointed at it or not when I
flip<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.459> over<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.879> back<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.449> see<00:03:34.569> that

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
flip it over the back you can see that

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.569 
flip it over the back you can see that
there's<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.079> little<00:03:35.650> thing<00:03:35.829> here<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
there's this little thing here which I

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.509 
there's this little thing here which I
believe<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.540> beeper<00:03:38.199> and<00:03:38.379> all<00:03:39.220> its<00:03:39.370> God

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
believe is the beeper and all its God

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.939 
believe is the beeper and all its God
has<00:03:39.669> got<00:03:39.879> these<00:03:39.970> two<00:03:40.209> wires<00:03:40.480> going<00:03:40.840> into<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.349> so

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
has got these two wires going into it so

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.409 
has got these two wires going into it so
if<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.159> want<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> disable<00:03:42.729> this<00:03:43.090> all<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.359> got

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
if you want to disable this all you got

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.479 
if you want to disable this all you got
to<00:03:43.599> do<00:03:43.720> is<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.019> disconnect<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.400> these

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
to do is just disconnect one of these

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.250 
to do is just disconnect one of these
two<00:03:45.790> wires<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.590> should<00:03:47.829> be<00:03:48.010> beep<00:03:48.699> free<00:03:49.260> so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
two wires and you should be beep free so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.170 
two wires and you should be beep free so
I<00:03:50.290> wanted<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.769> job<00:03:51.099> here<00:03:51.340> today<00:03:51.639> so<00:03:51.699> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
I wanted to this job here today so that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.270 
I wanted to this job here today so that
it<00:03:52.449> will<00:03:52.569> be<00:03:52.720> reversible<00:03:53.409> so<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.739> one<00:03:53.919> day<00:03:53.949> down

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
it will be reversible so if one day down

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.860 
it will be reversible so if one day down
the<00:03:54.400> road<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:54.699> decide<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.299> want<00:03:55.479> the<00:03:55.720> beep

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
the road we decide that we want the beep

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.990 
the road we decide that we want the beep
there<00:03:56.139> again<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:56.799> should<00:03:56.979> be<00:03:57.069> really<00:03:57.310> easy<00:03:57.430> to

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
there again it should be really easy to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
there again it should be really easy to
put<00:03:58.359> back<00:03:58.389> together<00:03:58.750> again<00:03:59.109> so<00:03:59.440> what<00:03:59.949> I'm

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
put back together again so what I'm

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.199 
put back together again so what I'm
gonna<00:04:00.190> do<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.400> I'm<00:04:00.459> gonna<00:04:00.519> use<00:04:00.699> a<00:04:00.729> soldering

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
gonna do is I'm gonna use a soldering

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.479 
gonna do is I'm gonna use a soldering
iron<00:04:01.479> and<00:04:01.810> I'm<00:04:02.139> just<00:04:02.290> gonna<00:04:02.379> solder<00:04:02.829> off<00:04:03.129> one

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
iron and I'm just gonna solder off one

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.369 
iron and I'm just gonna solder off one
of<00:04:03.519> these<00:04:03.669> two<00:04:04.090> wires<00:04:04.419> joining<00:04:04.930> us<00:04:05.049> into<00:04:05.260> the

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
of these two wires joining us into the

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.729 
of these two wires joining us into the
black<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.019> can<00:04:08.079> remove<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.560> but

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
black and just so I can remove it but

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:09.960 
black and just so I can remove it but
you<00:04:08.799> could<00:04:08.919> also<00:04:09.040> do<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:09.310> job<00:04:09.579> just<00:04:09.849> with<00:04:09.940> a

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you could also do this job just with a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.580 
you could also do this job just with a
pair<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.269> scissors<00:04:10.569> just<00:04:10.780> snip<00:04:11.139> one<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.470> them

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
pair of scissors just snip one of them

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.199 
pair of scissors just snip one of them
and<00:04:11.769> then<00:04:12.250> if<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.519> need<00:04:12.699> to<00:04:12.879> put<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.120> back

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
and then if you need to put it back

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.280 
and then if you need to put it back
together<00:04:13.389> you<00:04:13.569> could<00:04:13.720> twist<00:04:13.930> them<00:04:14.139> back

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
together you could twist them back

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.869 
together you could twist them back
together<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.829> little<00:04:15.010> bit<00:04:15.099> more<00:04:15.280> no

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
together this is a little bit more no

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.699 
together this is a little bit more no
professional<00:04:16.479> way<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.720> doing<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.139> so<00:04:17.289> there<00:04:17.620> we

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
professional way of doing it so there we

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.189 
professional way of doing it so there we
go<00:04:17.739> that's<00:04:18.370> all<00:04:18.729> it<00:04:18.909> took<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.449> little<00:04:19.720> two

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
go that's all it took just a little two

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.659 
go that's all it took just a little two
seconds<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.709> solder<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.250> wire<00:04:21.430> is

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
seconds of solder and that wire is

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.300 
seconds of solder and that wire is
disconnected<00:04:22.389> now<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.950> another<00:04:23.950> little

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
disconnected now and another little

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.649 
disconnected now and another little
thing<00:04:24.490> I'm<00:04:24.580> going<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.820> do<00:04:25.000> here<00:04:25.210> since<00:04:25.419> we<00:04:25.539> got

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
thing I'm going to do here since we got

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:26.879 
thing I'm going to do here since we got
that<00:04:25.719> little<00:04:26.020> bit<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.289> wire

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
that little bit of wire

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.830 
that little bit of wire
she's<00:04:27.009> exposed<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:28.330> just<00:04:28.479> going<00:04:28.599> to<00:04:28.659> put<00:04:28.810> a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
she's exposed I'm just going to put a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.480 
she's exposed I'm just going to put a
little<00:04:28.990> piece<00:04:29.229> of<00:04:29.349> electrical<00:04:29.860> tape<00:04:29.919> over<00:04:30.280> it

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
little piece of electrical tape over it

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.790 
little piece of electrical tape over it
just<00:04:30.699> so<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.419> doesn't<00:04:31.719> touch<00:04:31.930> any<00:04:32.319> of<00:04:32.680> the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
just so that it doesn't touch any of the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.219 
just so that it doesn't touch any of the
other<00:04:33.009> points<00:04:33.999> of<00:04:34.240> contact<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.050> surface

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
other points of contact on the surface

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.279 
other points of contact on the surface
on<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> circuit<00:04:36.520> board<00:04:36.759> there<00:04:37.139> because<00:04:38.139> who

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
on the circuit board there because who

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.050 
on the circuit board there because who
knows<00:04:38.499> we<00:04:38.800> might<00:04:38.949> short<00:04:39.249> something<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.789> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
knows we might short something out and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.269 
knows we might short something out and
you<00:04:40.539> know<00:04:41.080> cause<00:04:41.319> it<00:04:41.529> not<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.680> work<00:04:41.860> properly

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
you know cause it not to work properly

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.969 
you know cause it not to work properly
could<00:04:43.090> even<00:04:43.270> cause<00:04:43.539> it<00:04:43.779> to<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.439> know<00:04:44.590> fry<00:04:44.919> the

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
could even cause it to you know fry the

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.249 
could even cause it to you know fry the
board<00:04:45.430> or<00:04:45.610> something<00:04:45.969> so<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:46.840> put<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.080> little

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
board or something so so put that little

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.260 
board or something so so put that little
piece<00:04:47.379> of<00:04:47.740> electrical<00:04:48.430> tape<00:04:48.490> on<00:04:48.849> there<00:04:49.029> like

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
piece of electrical tape on there like

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.529 
piece of electrical tape on there like
that

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
that

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.839 
that
and<00:04:49.779> that<00:04:50.409> should<00:04:50.650> prevent<00:04:51.069> anything<00:04:51.699> like

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
and that should prevent anything like

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.939 
and that should prevent anything like
that<00:04:51.879> from<00:04:52.449> happening<00:04:52.689> so<00:04:53.169> that's<00:04:53.499> really<00:04:53.710> all

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
that from happening so that's really all

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.619 
that from happening so that's really all
there<00:04:54.099> was<00:04:54.279> to<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.639> job<00:04:54.879> all<00:04:55.029> we<00:04:55.120> got<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.360> do<00:04:55.479> is

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
there was to the job all we got to do is

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.570 
there was to the job all we got to do is
just<00:04:55.659> put<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.020> back<00:04:56.139> together<00:04:56.379> again<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.189> on

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
just put it back together again so on

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.070 
just put it back together again so on
the<00:04:57.849> circuit<00:04:58.210> board<00:04:58.389> goes<00:04:58.599> in<00:04:58.749> there<00:04:58.900> like

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
the circuit board goes in there like

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.439 
the circuit board goes in there like
that<00:04:59.319> has<00:04:59.560> these<00:04:59.680> two<00:04:59.889> little<00:05:00.000> tabs<00:05:01.000> would<00:05:01.330> you

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
that has these two little tabs would you

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.969 
that has these two little tabs would you
have<00:05:01.689> to<00:05:01.810> kind<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.080> kind<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.409> line<00:05:02.620> up<00:05:02.830> when

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
have to kind of kind of line up when

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.290 
have to kind of kind of line up when
you're<00:05:03.099> putting<00:05:03.279> it<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.610> like<00:05:03.789> that<00:05:04.000> I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
you're putting it in there like that I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.179 
you're putting it in there like that I
was<00:05:04.719> going<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.930> tuck<00:05:05.110> this<00:05:05.259> wire<00:05:05.469> in<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:05.949> it's<00:05:06.129> a

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
was going to tuck this wire in so it's a

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.469 
was going to tuck this wire in so it's a
little<00:05:06.310> bit<00:05:06.490> behind<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:07.029> it<00:05:07.090> doesn't<00:05:07.300> get<00:05:07.419> in

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
little bit behind so it doesn't get in

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.719 
little bit behind so it doesn't get in
the<00:05:07.509> way<00:05:07.629> of<00:05:07.659> our<00:05:07.840> backing<00:05:08.349> plate<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:09.340> backing

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
the way of our backing plate the backing

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.850 
the way of our backing plate the backing
plate<00:05:09.939> goes<00:05:10.120> back<00:05:10.389> on<00:05:10.629> I'll<00:05:10.840> just<00:05:10.870> pipe<00:05:11.620> some

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
plate goes back on I'll just pipe some

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.790 
plate goes back on I'll just pipe some
of<00:05:11.919> these<00:05:11.979> spider<00:05:12.759> webs<00:05:13.060> off<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.689> and<00:05:14.050> it

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
of these spider webs off of it and it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.249 
of these spider webs off of it and it
just<00:05:14.830> goes<00:05:15.069> in<00:05:15.250> there<00:05:15.400> like<00:05:15.430> that

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
just goes in there like that

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.469 
just goes in there like that
and<00:05:17.259> they'll<00:05:18.069> click<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:19.180> make<00:05:19.330> sure<00:05:19.449> I

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
and they'll click in and make sure I

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.850 
and they'll click in and make sure I
line<00:05:19.689> up<00:05:19.719> these<00:05:20.020> wires<00:05:20.259> with<00:05:20.529> the<00:05:20.620> little

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
line up these wires with the little

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.369 
line up these wires with the little
slots<00:05:21.189> for<00:05:21.460> them<00:05:22.680> just<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.979> this<00:05:25.379> click

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
slots for them just like this click

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.320 
slots for them just like this click
there<00:05:27.219> we<00:05:27.310> go<00:05:27.460> now<00:05:27.669> it's<00:05:27.849> all<00:05:27.969> back<00:05:28.120> together

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
there we go now it's all back together

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.600 
there we go now it's all back together
again<00:05:28.599> we<00:05:28.839> just<00:05:28.930> got<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.199> spin<00:05:29.439> it<00:05:29.589> around<00:05:29.680> the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
again we just got to spin it around the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.969 
again we just got to spin it around the
way<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:30.969> it<00:05:31.029> was<00:05:31.120> before

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
way that it was before

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.540 
way that it was before
okay<00:05:32.979> flow<00:05:33.189> these<00:05:33.370> wires<00:05:34.169> that<00:05:35.250> our<00:05:36.250> thumb

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
okay flow these wires that our thumb

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.279 
okay flow these wires that our thumb
screw<00:05:36.879> goes<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.389> in<00:05:37.629> again<00:05:39.870> I'm<00:05:40.870> try<00:05:41.169> and

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
screw goes back in again I'm try and

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.159 
screw goes back in again I'm try and
line<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.529> up<00:05:41.740> as<00:05:41.919> best<00:05:41.949> you<00:05:42.310> can<00:05:42.779> you<00:05:43.779> can<00:05:43.930> use

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
line it up as best you can you can use

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.139 
line it up as best you can you can use
that<00:05:44.409> little<00:05:45.039> LED<00:05:45.490> light<00:05:45.520> which<00:05:45.849> is<00:05:45.939> on<00:05:46.029> the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
that little LED light which is on the

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.540 
that little LED light which is on the
bottom<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:47.379> help<00:05:47.409> you<00:05:47.830> once<00:05:48.009> you<00:05:48.129> plug<00:05:48.339> it<00:05:48.520> back

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
bottom to help you once you plug it back

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.249 
bottom to help you once you plug it back
in<00:05:48.849> to<00:05:48.969> make<00:05:49.089> sure<00:05:49.270> you've<00:05:49.449> got<00:05:49.599> it<00:05:49.629> lined<00:05:50.020> up

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
in to make sure you've got it lined up

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.439 
in to make sure you've got it lined up
the<00:05:51.039> way<00:05:51.129> this<00:05:51.250> one<00:05:51.460> works<00:05:51.699> is<00:05:51.849> when<00:05:51.969> the<00:05:52.120> the

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
the way this one works is when the the

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.779 
the way this one works is when the the
the<00:05:52.899> red<00:05:53.050> light<00:05:53.289> is<00:05:53.439> on<00:05:53.469> it<00:05:53.979> means<00:05:54.430> that<00:05:54.580> there

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
the red light is on it means that there

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.969 
the red light is on it means that there
that<00:05:55.449> the<00:05:55.659> beam<00:05:55.899> is<00:05:56.199> complete<00:05:56.740> there's

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
that the beam is complete there's

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.829 
that the beam is complete there's
nothing<00:05:57.279> blocking<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:57.909> so<00:05:57.939> make<00:05:58.599> sure<00:05:58.629> you

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
nothing blocking it so make sure you

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.300 
nothing blocking it so make sure you
line<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.169> up<00:05:59.229> so<00:05:59.409> you<00:05:59.469> can<00:05:59.529> see<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.860> beam<00:06:00.099> and

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
line it up so you can see that beam and

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.879 
line it up so you can see that beam and
then<00:06:00.729> you<00:06:00.849> should<00:06:01.029> be<00:06:01.180> good<00:06:01.210> so<00:06:01.710> I've<00:06:02.710> got<00:06:02.860> a

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
then you should be good so I've got a

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.800 
then you should be good so I've got a
plug<00:06:03.159> back<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.610> again<00:06:03.849> you<00:06:04.060> can<00:06:04.180> see<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.509> red

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
plug back in again you can see that red

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.300 
plug back in again you can see that red
light<00:06:05.110> which<00:06:05.319> is<00:06:05.469> down<00:06:05.680> there<00:06:05.949> where<00:06:06.129> just

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
light which is down there where just

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.829 
light which is down there where just
telling<00:06:06.550> me<00:06:06.639> that<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:06.909> beam<00:06:07.120> has<00:06:07.539> been

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:07.839 
telling me that the beam has been

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.450 
telling me that the beam has been
complete<00:06:08.319> its<00:06:08.529> complete<00:06:08.949> there's<00:06:09.129> nothing

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
complete its complete there's nothing

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.519 
complete its complete there's nothing
blocking<00:06:09.610> it<00:06:10.089> but<00:06:10.870> you'll<00:06:10.960> see<00:06:11.110> when<00:06:11.259> I<00:06:11.289> burn

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
blocking it but you'll see when I burn

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.709 
blocking it but you'll see when I burn
my<00:06:11.680> hand<00:06:11.979> down<00:06:12.189> and<00:06:12.460> cover<00:06:12.669> it<00:06:12.849> up<00:06:12.969> there<00:06:13.569> it

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
my hand down and cover it up there it

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.320 
my hand down and cover it up there it
goes<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.139> light<00:06:14.289> is<00:06:14.439> turned<00:06:14.680> off<00:06:14.889> again<00:06:15.330> so

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
goes the light is turned off again so

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.639 
goes the light is turned off again so
what<00:06:16.479> that<00:06:16.599> means<00:06:16.839> is<00:06:17.020> that<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.289> beam<00:06:17.439> is

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
what that means is that the beam is

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.159 
what that means is that the beam is
still<00:06:17.889> working<00:06:18.279> the<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:19.089> feature<00:06:19.719> still

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
still working the the feature still

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.839 
still working the the feature still
works<00:06:20.439> but<00:06:20.830> it's<00:06:20.979> not<00:06:21.069> making<00:06:21.370> that<00:06:21.610> annoying

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
works but it's not making that annoying

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.600 
works but it's not making that annoying
beep<00:06:22.240> now<00:06:22.509> every<00:06:22.810> time<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.139> I<00:06:23.229> cross<00:06:23.500> it<00:06:23.800> so

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
beep now every time that I cross it so

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.070 
beep now every time that I cross it so
let's<00:06:24.789> give<00:06:24.939> them<00:06:25.029> a<00:06:25.180> give<00:06:25.539> it<00:06:25.599> a<00:06:25.659> little<00:06:25.779> try

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
let's give them a give it a little try

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.420 
let's give them a give it a little try
here<00:06:26.349> I'll<00:06:26.439> just<00:06:26.469> try<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:26.800> close<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.250> door

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
here I'll just try and close the door

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.269 
here I'll just try and close the door
and<00:06:27.460> we'll<00:06:27.789> see<00:06:28.029> if<00:06:28.569> it'll<00:06:29.319> close<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.129> we'll

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
and we'll see if it'll close and we'll

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.219 
and we'll see if it'll close and we'll
see<00:06:30.490> if<00:06:30.729> when<00:06:31.270> I<00:06:31.300> put<00:06:31.569> something<00:06:31.750> in<00:06:31.899> front<00:06:31.930> of

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
see if when I put something in front of

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:42.379 
see if when I put something in front of
it<00:06:32.349> it's<00:06:32.529> gonna<00:06:32.710> stop<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.550> from<00:06:33.699> closing

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.959 

so<00:06:42.930> it's<00:06:43.259> closing<00:06:43.560> successfully<00:06:44.340> so<00:06:44.550> far<00:06:44.789> the

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
so it's closing successfully so far the

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.610 
so it's closing successfully so far the
red<00:06:45.599> lights<00:06:45.810> still<00:06:46.050> on

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
red lights still on

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.040 
red lights still on
and<00:06:47.610> there<00:06:47.759> goes<00:06:48.090> it's<00:06:48.330> completely<00:06:48.780> closed

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
and there goes it's completely closed

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.749 
and there goes it's completely closed
now<00:06:49.259> so<00:06:49.439> I'll<00:06:49.560> open<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:49.979> back<00:06:50.099> up<00:06:50.159> again<00:06:50.460> and

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
now so I'll open it back up again and

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.029 
now so I'll open it back up again and
this<00:06:51.719> time<00:06:51.780> we'll<00:06:52.080> try<00:06:52.199> putting<00:06:52.590> something<00:06:52.800> in

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
this time we'll try putting something in

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:00.230 
this time we'll try putting something in
the<00:06:53.069> way<00:06:53.280> that<00:06:53.550> lens<00:06:53.729> coming<00:06:54.120> down<00:06:59.180> though<00:07:00.180> the

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
the way that lens coming down though the

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.670 
the way that lens coming down though the
time<00:07:00.419> is<00:07:00.449> coming<00:07:00.750> down<00:07:00.990> I'm<00:07:01.199> gonna<00:07:01.289> try<00:07:01.560> and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
time is coming down I'm gonna try and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.200 
time is coming down I'm gonna try and
put<00:07:01.830> my<00:07:01.949> hand<00:07:02.250> in<00:07:02.400> the<00:07:02.460> wave<00:07:02.639> and<00:07:02.939> see<00:07:03.090> what

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
put my hand in the wave and see what

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.529 
put my hand in the wave and see what
happens<00:07:03.659> and<00:07:04.469> there<00:07:04.740> it<00:07:04.830> goes<00:07:04.889> stops<00:07:05.580> right

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
happens and there it goes stops right

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:13.820 
happens and there it goes stops right
when<00:07:06.659> the<00:07:06.780> beam<00:07:06.930> gets<00:07:07.139> crossed

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.900

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
very simple way of disabling that

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.700 
very simple way of disabling that

door<00:07:21.100> opener<00:07:21.130> makes<00:07:21.640> without<00:07:21.970> having<00:07:22.330> to

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
door opener makes without having to

actually<00:07:23.350> compromise<00:07:24.040> the<00:07:24.400> safety<00:07:24.840> of<00:07:25.840> that

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
actually compromise the safety of that

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.460 
actually compromise the safety of that

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
safety feature itself as you saw is very

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.440 
safety feature itself as you saw is very
simple<00:07:30.160> job<00:07:30.400> to<00:07:30.550> do<00:07:30.700> you<00:07:30.850> really<00:07:31.060> only<00:07:31.210> needed

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.450 
simple job to do you really only needed

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.410 
simple job to do you really only needed
two<00:07:32.110> tools<00:07:32.440> just<00:07:32.890> a<00:07:33.100> screwdriver<00:07:33.970> to<00:07:34.180> get<00:07:34.270> that

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
two tools just a screwdriver to get that

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.810 
two tools just a screwdriver to get that
backing<00:07:34.870> plate<00:07:35.110> off<00:07:35.320> and<00:07:35.650> I<00:07:36.460> use<00:07:36.670> the

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820 
backing plate off and I use the

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.130 
backing plate off and I use the
soldering<00:07:37.210> gun<00:07:37.510> but<00:07:37.720> you<00:07:37.780> could<00:07:37.960> probably

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140 
soldering gun but you could probably

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.510 
soldering gun but you could probably
just<00:07:38.350> use<00:07:38.560> a<00:07:38.590> pair<00:07:38.860> of<00:07:38.890> scissors<00:07:39.160> and<00:07:39.490> just

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 
just use a pair of scissors and just

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.970 
just use a pair of scissors and just
skip<00:07:39.820> through<00:07:40.000> that<00:07:40.060> wire<00:07:40.330> really<00:07:41.200> easily<00:07:41.590> so

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:41.980 
skip through that wire really easily so

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.740 
skip through that wire really easily so
so<00:07:42.490> anyway<00:07:42.580> I<00:07:42.790> hope<00:07:43.030> you<00:07:43.090> enjoyed<00:07:43.540> watching
