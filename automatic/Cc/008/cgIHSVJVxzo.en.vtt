that I think the update is coming up so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
that I think the update is coming up so
that's<00:01:50.970> cool<00:01:51.240> yeah<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.530> sounds<00:01:52.770> like

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that's cool yeah so that's sounds like

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
14 yeah I did have that I mean the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
14 yeah I did have that I mean the
internet<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.289> down<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.799> we're<00:01:58.920> salable<00:01:59.460> to
