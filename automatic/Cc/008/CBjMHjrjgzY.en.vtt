00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.179 

so<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.379> drawing<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.860> holding<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so and if you're drawing I got holding a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.070 
so and if you're drawing I got holding a
shield<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.650> draw<00:01:08.070> his<00:01:08.490> arm

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
shield just you want to draw his arm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.219 
shield just you want to draw his arm
anyway<00:01:11.450> even<00:01:12.450> though<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.020> covered

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
anyway even though it's gonna be covered

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.420 
anyway even though it's gonna be covered
up<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> shield<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.100> finished

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
up by the shield and you're finished

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
up by the shield and you're finished
drawing<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> looks

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
drawing so you can just like so it looks

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
drawing so you can just like so it looks
more<00:01:17.610> natural<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.360> older<00:01:18.540> than<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
more natural when it's older than the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
more natural when it's older than the
shield<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.600> his<00:01:21.780> forearm<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
shield so that's his forearm so that the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.359 
shield so that's his forearm so that the
shoulder<00:01:23.939> bicep<00:01:24.860> okay

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
shoulder bicep okay

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.539 
shoulder bicep okay
rough<00:01:26.640> sketch<00:01:27.420> down<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
rough sketch down so now you want to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.440 
rough sketch down so now you want to
start<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.659> draw<00:01:31.200> details<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.119> you're<00:01:33.329> not

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
start to draw details so if you're not

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
start to draw details so if you're not
very<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.350> drawing<00:01:34.560> sometimes<00:01:35.130> it's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
very good at drawing sometimes it's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.719 
very good at drawing sometimes it's
easier<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.750> draw<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> full<00:01:37.560> face<00:01:37.920> helmet<00:01:38.220> set

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
easier to draw a full face helmet set

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
easier to draw a full face helmet set
out<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> draw<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> face<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.950> what

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
out to draw the face and that's what

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.859

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's automatically bigger with the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's automatically bigger with the
helmet<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.520> helmet<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.000> farmer<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.530> makes

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
helmet this helmet is farmer so it makes

here<00:03:20.069> most<00:03:21.069> nights<00:03:21.160> I'd<00:03:21.519> look<00:03:21.700> some<00:03:21.910> sort<00:03:22.120> of

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
here most nights I'd look some sort of

a crest or something like this it's a
real<00:03:32.110> all<00:03:32.500> right<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.209> do<00:03:34.420> just

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
real all right so now you can do just

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.710 
real all right so now you can do just
two<00:03:36.280> little<00:03:36.459> lines<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.030> neck<00:03:37.239> because

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
two little lines for the neck because

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.470 
two little lines for the neck because
they<00:03:37.840> didn't<00:03:38.049> have<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> lot<00:03:38.319> of<00:03:39.450> bare<00:03:40.450> skin

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
they didn't have a lot of bare skin

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.229 
they didn't have a lot of bare skin
exposed<00:03:41.290> because<00:03:41.920> you're<00:03:42.340> constantly<00:03:42.970> full

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
exposed because you're constantly full
