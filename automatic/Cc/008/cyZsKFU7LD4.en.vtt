ago<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.170> decided<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.250> use<00:00:35.550> sandstone<00:00:36.330> as<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
ago I decided to use sandstone as one of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.259 
ago I decided to use sandstone as one of
the<00:00:37.650> accent<00:00:38.160> colors<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.790> room<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
the accent colors in the room and I

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:40.820 
the accent colors in the room and I
think<00:00:39.330> it<00:00:39.600> came<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.019> good<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
think it came out really good with this

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.400 
think it came out really good with this
Bruce<00:00:41.160> would<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> glass<00:00:42.570> panes<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
Bruce would I use the glass panes that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.530 
Bruce would I use the glass panes that
kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> connected<00:00:44.160> everything<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
kind of connected everything to it and I

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.229 
kind of connected everything to it and I
did<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.920> section<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.579> wall<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
where the windows ahead just to give it

an accident
from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> outside<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.930> went<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
from the outside I went with the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.870 
from the outside I went with the
hardened<00:01:03.000> clay<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.559> walls<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> did

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hardened clay for the walls and I did

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
hardened clay for the walls and I did
these<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.360> inset<00:01:06.840> designs<00:01:07.289> now<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.890> was

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
these little inset designs now this was

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.609 
these little inset designs now this was
something<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.750> it's<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.320> hard

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
something that it's really really hard

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
something that it's really really hard
to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.009> without<00:01:11.250> half<00:01:11.729> slabs<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.539> you<00:01:12.899> want

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to do without half slabs and you want

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
to do without half slabs and you want
shelving<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> stuff<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.850> without

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
shelving and stuff like that so without

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.740 
shelving and stuff like that so without
doing<00:01:16.189> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> over<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> top<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.420> wood

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
doing kind of over the top with wood

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
doing kind of over the top with wood
shelving<00:01:19.260> on<00:01:19.439> decided<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
shelving on decided to go with the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.160 
shelving on decided to go with the
double<00:01:20.850> thick<00:01:21.180> walls<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
double thick walls and just put the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
double thick walls and just put the
inset<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> came<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.159> good<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.610> figure<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
inset it came out good a figure that I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.929 
inset it came out good a figure that I
was<00:01:24.689> uses<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.320> bookcases<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.280> item

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
was uses little bookcases and item

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
was uses little bookcases and item
frames<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> give<00:01:28.770> sections<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> all

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
frames to kind of give sections to all

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.570 
frames to kind of give sections to all
of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.380> food<00:01:31.650> groups<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
of the the different food groups that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.859 
of the the different food groups that
you<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:32.939> normally<00:01:33.299> see<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.659> kitchen

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you would normally see in a kitchen

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
you would normally see in a kitchen
maybe<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.530> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> bunch<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
maybe this would be like a bunch of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690 
maybe this would be like a bunch of
cookbooks<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:37.380> reference<00:01:38.070> materials

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
cookbooks or just reference materials

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
cookbooks or just reference materials
for<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.240> bunch<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> different<00:01:40.079> type<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> recipes

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
for a bunch of different type of recipes

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.490 
for a bunch of different type of recipes
so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> turned<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:42.900> pretty<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so I think it turned out pretty good a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
so I think it turned out pretty good a
little<00:01:43.770> piston<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.299> stepstool<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
little piston there for the stepstool I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
little piston there for the stepstool I
then<00:01:46.530> used<00:01:46.740> sandstone<00:01:47.400> half<00:01:47.610> slabs<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
then used sandstone half slabs so I can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
then used sandstone half slabs so I can
do<00:01:48.600> something<00:01:48.840> cool<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> table<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
do something cool with the table and I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
do something cool with the table and I
just<00:01:50.670> sectioned<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.600> table<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.200> with

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
just sectioned off the table here with

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
just sectioned off the table here with
with<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.369> snow<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.299> was<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.899> really

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
with some snow it was really really

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
with some snow it was really really
impossible<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.280> any<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> Corpening

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
impossible to do any kind of Corpening

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050 
impossible to do any kind of Corpening
with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> half<00:01:58.680> slab<00:01:58.979> floors<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.700> snow

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with the half slab floors but snow

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
with the half slab floors but snow
layers<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.590> job<00:02:01.619> with

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
layers do a really really good job with

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
layers do a really really good job with
that<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.270> layer<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that as you can see the little layer of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.649 
that as you can see the little layer of
snow<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.070> used<00:02:05.430> basically<00:02:06.390> brought

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
snow that I just used basically brought

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.979 
snow that I just used basically brought
it<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> half<00:02:07.200> slab<00:02:07.549> level<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.299> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it up to half slab level and one more so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.410 
it up to half slab level and one more so
that<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.290> would<00:02:10.410> give<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.730> runner<00:02:11.970> carpet

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that it would give the the runner carpet

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.620 
that it would give the the runner carpet
effect<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.049> I<00:02:13.829> surrounded<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:15.120> table

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
effect and I surrounded it this table

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.809 
effect and I surrounded it this table
with<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.930> now<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.140> table<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.640> new

with it now the table this is a new
design<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.450> kind<00:02:18.660> of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
design that I kind of

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.399 
design that I kind of

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
like so that I tried it and it does kind

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.509 
like so that I tried it and it does kind
of<00:02:26.390> weird<00:02:26.629> stuff<00:02:26.840> at<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> bottom<00:02:27.590> here<00:02:27.890> with

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
of weird stuff at the bottom here with

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.670 
of weird stuff at the bottom here with
the<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.269> bottom<00:02:29.390> stair<00:02:29.840> block<00:02:30.110> but

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the the bottom stair block but

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440 
the the bottom stair block but
all-in-all<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.159> really<00:02:31.549> liked<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> chairs

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
all-in-all I really liked it the chairs

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.300 
all-in-all I really liked it the chairs
are<00:02:32.659> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:32.900> bit<00:02:33.019> higher<00:02:33.230> than<00:02:33.500> normal<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
are a little bit higher than normal the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.559 
are a little bit higher than normal the
table<00:02:34.670> sits<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.940> little<00:02:35.030> bit<00:02:35.180> higher<00:02:35.269> than

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
table sits a little bit higher than

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.839 
table sits a little bit higher than
normal<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:36.319> abnormally<00:02:37.280> high<00:02:37.459> due

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
normal but it's not abnormally high due

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.369 
normal but it's not abnormally high due
to<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> fact<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.720> rest<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.140> floor

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
to the fact that the rest of the floor

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.000 
to the fact that the rest of the floor
is<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> half<00:02:39.739> slab<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:41.239> used<00:02:41.720> these<00:02:42.110> weighted

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
is a half slab and I used these weighted

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.339 
is a half slab and I used these weighted
pressure<00:02:43.250> plates<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.790> gold<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.049> work

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
pressure plates in gold to like work

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.800 
pressure plates in gold to like work
with<00:02:45.379> as<00:02:45.980> placemats<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.879> a<00:02:47.329> little<00:02:47.599> Runner

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.630 
with as placemats and a little Runner
tablecloth<00:02:48.530> along<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.099> middle<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.519> it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
tablecloth along the middle of it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.550 
tablecloth along the middle of it
actually<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.599> middle<00:02:50.900> if<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.140> wanted<00:02:51.440> a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
actually in the middle if I wanted a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740 
actually in the middle if I wanted a
torch<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.220> couldn't<00:02:52.549> really<00:02:52.670> do<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.510> I

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
torch I couldn't really do that so I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.190 
torch I couldn't really do that so I
just<00:02:53.959> used<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.860> yellow<00:02:55.400> clay<00:02:55.819> block<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
just used a yellow clay block for the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.960 
just used a yellow clay block for the
centerpiece<00:02:57.829> there<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.400> I'll<00:02:58.489> put<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.760> torch

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
centerpiece there and I'll put the torch

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.030 
centerpiece there and I'll put the torch
right<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.299> top<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.750> worked<00:02:59.930> well<00:03:00.200> along

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
right on top and it worked well along

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
right on top and it worked well along
with<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.370> little<00:03:01.609> plant<00:03:02.000> holders<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
with these little plant holders the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.630 
with these little plant holders the
little<00:03:03.049> potted<00:03:03.379> plants<00:03:03.769> without<00:03:03.980> plants<00:03:04.549> in

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
little potted plants without plants in

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880 
little potted plants without plants in
them<00:03:04.760> naturally<00:03:05.269> tact<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.109> kind<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.590> cups

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
them naturally tact is kind of like cups

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.410 
them naturally tact is kind of like cups
so<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.190> table<00:03:07.519> would<00:03:07.640> appear<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:07.970> be<00:03:08.090> set

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
so the table would appear to be set

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420 
so the table would appear to be set
which<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.810> think<00:03:09.019> was<00:03:09.170> good<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.650> did<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> little

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
which I think was good I did a little

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.970 
which I think was good I did a little
dining<00:03:10.910> room<00:03:11.180> area<00:03:11.720> mirror<00:03:12.109> kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.859> like

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
dining room area mirror kind of like

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.949 
dining room area mirror kind of like
you'd<00:03:13.190> see<00:03:13.489> maybe<00:03:13.700> some<00:03:14.000> fine<00:03:14.239> shine<00:03:14.540> oh<00:03:14.569> and

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
you'd see maybe some fine shine oh and

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.449 
you'd see maybe some fine shine oh and
although<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.319> didn't<00:03:15.680> want<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.859> put<00:03:16.040> too<00:03:16.340> many

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
although I didn't want to put too many

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.309 
although I didn't want to put too many
item<00:03:16.849> frames<00:03:17.150> because<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.629> already<00:03:17.870> had<00:03:18.019> quite

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
item frames because I already had quite

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.680 
item frames because I already had quite
a<00:03:18.349> bit<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.739> outskirts<00:03:19.220> here<00:03:19.879> but<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> called

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.720 
a bit on the outskirts here but I called
a<00:03:20.870> couple<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.319> cauldrons<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.890> toth<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.370> emulate

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
a couple of cauldrons of toth to emulate

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.670 
a couple of cauldrons of toth to emulate
pots<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.359> think<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> came<00:03:23.989> out<00:03:24.169> really<00:03:24.349> good

off-center<00:03:34.310> look<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.329> stopped<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:35.900> short

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
off-center look and I stopped here short

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.900 
off-center look and I stopped here short
of<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.590> corner<00:03:36.980> just<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.340> give<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.669> a<00:03:37.760> little

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
of the corner just to give it a little

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.819 
of the corner just to give it a little
bit<00:03:38.120> more<00:03:38.359> of<00:03:38.419> a<00:03:38.510> minimalistic<00:03:38.989> look<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.590> never

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
bit more of a minimalistic look I never

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.129 
bit more of a minimalistic look I never
want<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.280> too<00:03:40.459> busy<00:03:40.669> I<00:03:41.030> did<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.840> small

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
want it to be too busy I did a small

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.900 
want it to be too busy I did a small
shelving<00:03:42.620> unit<00:03:42.919> here<00:03:43.130> which<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.459> too<00:03:43.639> wide

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
shelving unit here which is too wide

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.180 
shelving unit here which is too wide
with<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> couple<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.690> mushroom<00:03:45.470> bowls<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.950> top

with a couple of mushroom bowls on top

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.970 
with a couple of mushroom bowls on top
the<00:03:46.400> immunity<00:03:46.760> like<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> yeah<00:03:47.239> maybe<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:47.870> a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
the immunity like a yeah maybe like a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.839 
the immunity like a yeah maybe like a
china<00:03:48.980> cabinet<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.919> the<00:03:51.919> ceiling<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.459> really

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
china cabinet and the ceiling I really

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.210 
china cabinet and the ceiling I really
really<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.840> wanted<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.470> give<00:03:54.829> an

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
really like to I wanted to give an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.659 
really like to I wanted to give an
impression<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.569> was<00:03:56.799> not<00:03:57.799> just<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.430> flat

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
impression that it was not just a flat

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.539 
impression that it was not just a flat
ceiling<00:03:59.060> or<00:03:59.510> not<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.750> vaulted<00:04:00.230> ceiling<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.250> I

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
ceiling or not a vaulted ceiling so I

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.670 
ceiling or not a vaulted ceiling so I
went<00:04:01.970> with<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.299> a<00:04:02.419> flat<00:04:02.629> ceiling<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.379> these

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
went with just a flat ceiling and these

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.710 
went with just a flat ceiling and these
little<00:04:03.919> additions<00:04:04.430> here<00:04:04.609> now<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.480> cool<00:04:05.690> thing

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
little additions here now the cool thing

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.690 
little additions here now the cool thing
about<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.410> type<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.680> design<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.519> can

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
about this type of design is you can

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.809 
about this type of design is you can
hide<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.660> glowstone<00:04:09.200> up<00:04:09.500> top<00:04:10.069> or<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.430> lamps

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
hide the glowstone up top or the lamps

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.369 
hide the glowstone up top or the lamps
and<00:04:10.879> above<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.419> naturally<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> have<00:04:12.109> some

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
and above that naturally I have some

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.039 
and above that naturally I have some
some<00:04:13.069> redstone<00:04:13.340> blocks<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.359> are<00:04:14.419> powering

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
some redstone blocks that are powering

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.659 
some redstone blocks that are powering
the<00:04:15.199> lamps<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.919> could<00:04:16.160> have<00:04:16.250> been<00:04:16.370> seized

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
the lamps but I could have been seized

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.370 
the lamps but I could have been seized
aliyou<00:04:17.180> 'zed<00:04:17.239> glowstone<00:04:17.780> although<00:04:18.199> I<00:04:18.260> think

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
aliyou 'zed glowstone although I think

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.620 
aliyou 'zed glowstone although I think
the<00:04:18.620> lamp<00:04:18.859> texture<00:04:19.280> does

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
the lamp texture does

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.960 
the lamp texture does
a<00:04:19.660> little<00:04:20.380> bit<00:04:20.470> better<00:04:20.650> justice<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.610> and

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
a little bit better justice for that and

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.880 
a little bit better justice for that and
I<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.390> did<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> square<00:04:23.080> design<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.740> there's

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
I just did the square design so there's

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.100 
I just did the square design so there's
a<00:04:23.950> little<00:04:24.250> gap<00:04:24.600> can't<00:04:25.600> really<00:04:25.870> see<00:04:26.020> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
a little gap can't really see the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.720 
a little gap can't really see the
shadows<00:04:26.470> due<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.950> lighting<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:27.550> if<00:04:27.640> I

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
shadows due to the lighting but if I

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.160 
shadows due to the lighting but if I
would<00:04:27.880> turn<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.270> moody<00:04:28.570> brightness<00:04:29.020> it

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
would turn it on moody brightness it

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.480 
would turn it on moody brightness it
does<00:04:29.350> something<00:04:29.620> different<00:04:29.800> I'll<00:04:30.250> actually

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
does something different I'll actually

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.640 
does something different I'll actually
show<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:31.570> let's<00:04:31.780> see<00:04:32.020> options

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
show that to you let's see options

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.760 
show that to you let's see options
videos<00:04:33.400> sitting<00:04:33.850> moody<00:04:34.660> brightness<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:35.590> it's

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
videos sitting moody brightness so it's

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.650 
videos sitting moody brightness so it's
a<00:04:35.890> little<00:04:36.130> bit<00:04:36.430> dim<00:04:36.670> but<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.000> can<00:04:37.210> tell<00:04:37.450> how

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
a little bit dim but you can tell how

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.570 
a little bit dim but you can tell how
the<00:04:37.720> light<00:04:37.990> kind<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.320> drips<00:04:38.590> out<00:04:38.740> from<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the light kind of drips out from the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.310 
the light kind of drips out from the
sides<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.110> came<00:04:41.260> out

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
sides of it and I think it came out

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.620 
sides of it and I think it came out
pretty<00:04:41.680> cool<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.280> all<00:04:42.640> in<00:04:43.000> all<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.360> was<00:04:43.600> really

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
pretty cool but all in all I was really

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.290 
pretty cool but all in all I was really
really<00:04:44.170> happy<00:04:44.380> with<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> design<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.550> hope

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
really happy with the design and hope

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.380 
really happy with the design and hope
you<00:04:46.420> guys<00:04:46.600> like<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:46.930> -<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.920> only<00:04:48.190> qualms<00:04:49.120> that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
you guys like it - the only qualms that

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.510 
you guys like it - the only qualms that
I<00:04:49.420> have<00:04:49.630> about<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.080> design<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.920> the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
I have about this design is that the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.860 
I have about this design is that the
lighting<00:04:51.760> glitches<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.600> played<00:04:52.840> with

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
lighting glitches that it played with

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.410 
lighting glitches that it played with
this<00:04:53.320> this<00:04:54.040> middle<00:04:54.430> block<00:04:54.640> here<00:04:54.970> which

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
this this middle block here which

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.820 
this this middle block here which
there's<00:04:55.720> nothing<00:04:56.020> really<00:04:56.170> I<00:04:56.320> could<00:04:56.590> do<00:04:56.710> about

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
there's nothing really I could do about

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.620 
there's nothing really I could do about
that<00:04:57.010> if<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.490> wanted<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.850> centerpiece<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.540> I

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
that if I wanted the centerpiece and I

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.410 
that if I wanted the centerpiece and I
figured<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.260> look<00:05:00.100> lighting<00:05:00.550> glitch<00:05:00.820> was<00:05:01.150> a

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
figured that look lighting glitch was a

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.360 
figured that look lighting glitch was a
good<00:05:01.630> trade-off<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.770> torch<00:05:03.070> in<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
good trade-off for the torch in the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.040 
good trade-off for the torch in the
middle<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.820> give<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.180> ambience<00:05:04.540> that<00:05:05.020> I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
middle to give that ambience that I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.040 
middle to give that ambience that I
wanted<00:05:05.380> so<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:06.010> hope<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.940> guys<00:05:07.120> really<00:05:07.180> enjoyed

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
wanted so I hope you guys really enjoyed
