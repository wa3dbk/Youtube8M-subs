hello everyone I'm the awesome soul and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.280 
hello everyone I'm the awesome soul and
I'm<00:00:08.130> here<00:00:08.430> today<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.760> show<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> little<00:00:09.540> idea

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
I'm here today to show off a little idea

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.539 
I'm here today to show off a little idea
I<00:00:10.349> had<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:10.740> Robocraft<00:00:12.410> why<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.589> do<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
I had for Robocraft why not do this as a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.180 
I had for Robocraft why not do this as a
text<00:00:15.030> document<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.570> ask<00:00:15.750> or<00:00:16.049> type<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.920> out<00:00:17.040> on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
text document you ask or type it out on

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.660 
text document you ask or type it out on
the<00:00:17.340> forums<00:00:18.380> well<00:00:19.380> I'd<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.340> say<00:00:20.490> I'm

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the forums well I'd like to say I'm

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200 
the forums well I'd like to say I'm
fairly<00:00:21.240> decent<00:00:21.810> at<00:00:22.050> making<00:00:22.680> videos<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.310> it's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
fairly decent at making videos and it's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.800 
fairly decent at making videos and it's
a<00:00:24.330> bit<00:00:24.480> easier<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:25.080> reading<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.650> wall<00:00:25.860> of<00:00:26.010> text

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
a bit easier than reading a wall of text

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.760 
a bit easier than reading a wall of text
plus<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.020> visual<00:00:28.380> aids<00:00:28.710> help<00:00:28.950> a<00:00:29.100> lot<00:00:30.620> so<00:00:31.620> this

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
plus the visual aids help a lot so this

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.850 
plus the visual aids help a lot so this
is<00:00:31.920> my<00:00:32.099> idea<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.880> coloring<00:00:33.720> your<00:00:34.440> bought-in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is my idea for coloring your bought-in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
is my idea for coloring your bought-in
Robocraft<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> little<00:00:36.030> bit<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.810> armor

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Robocraft and a little bit of an armor

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.870 
Robocraft and a little bit of an armor
tweak<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.740> guess<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.190> say<00:00:38.220> for<00:00:38.580> the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
tweak I guess you could say for the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.110 
tweak I guess you could say for the
texture<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.070> currently<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> game<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.970> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
texture so currently in the game we have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
texture so currently in the game we have
a<00:00:42.150> lot<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:46.550> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
a lot of this but not a lot of this so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
a lot of this but not a lot of this so
say<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.060> you<00:00:48.210> wanted<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.810> orange<00:00:49.140> racing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
say if you wanted an orange racing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.240 
say if you wanted an orange racing
stripe

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stripe

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.780 
stripe
in<00:00:50.730> tier<00:00:51.090> 10<00:00:51.590> you'd<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.040> tier<00:00:53.430> 4

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
in tier 10 you'd have to use tier 4

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.000 
in tier 10 you'd have to use tier 4
armor<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.810> isn't<00:00:55.079> necessarily<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
armor which isn't necessarily that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090 
armor which isn't necessarily that
viable<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.970> that<00:00:57.270> tier<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:57.810> just<00:00:58.530> uses<00:00:58.920> up

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
viable in that tier and just uses up

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.840 
viable in that tier and just uses up
your<00:00:59.130> CPU<00:01:00.079> also<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.560> blocks<00:01:01.829> texture<00:01:02.460> itself

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
your CPU also the blocks texture itself

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.560 
your CPU also the blocks texture itself
makes<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.960> rather<00:01:04.199> obvious<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.250> each<00:01:06.030> block

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
makes it rather obvious that each block

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
makes it rather obvious that each block
is<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> certain<00:01:08.310> location<00:01:09.110> what<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> mean<00:01:10.409> by

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is in a certain location what I mean by

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.120 
is in a certain location what I mean by
that<00:01:10.620> is<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:12.270> doesn't<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:13.050> like<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.650> bot<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that is it doesn't look like the bot is

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.450 
that is it doesn't look like the bot is
one<00:01:14.550> whole<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.659> looks<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.460> something

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
one whole thing it looks like something

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.990 
one whole thing it looks like something
made<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.390> lot<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.920> pieces<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
made out of a lot of little pieces it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
made out of a lot of little pieces it
doesn't<00:01:21.420> feel<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.990> entity<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> me<00:01:22.740> my

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
doesn't feel like one entity to me my

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
doesn't feel like one entity to me my
solution<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.350> would<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.380> something

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
solution for this would be something

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.170 
solution for this would be something
like<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.600> large<00:01:28.020> texture<00:01:28.799> map

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
like this you have one large texture map

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.980 
like this you have one large texture map
for<00:01:30.180> every<00:01:31.080> single<00:01:31.320> block<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.220> certain<00:01:32.580> tier

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
for every single block of a certain tier

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
for every single block of a certain tier
for<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.110> example<00:01:34.470> let's<00:01:35.400> say<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> tier

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
for this example let's say this is tier

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.039 
for this example let's say this is tier
8<00:01:36.780> armor<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.150> tier<00:01:39.479> 8<00:01:39.690> armor

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
8 armor so we have one tier 8 armor

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.170 
8 armor so we have one tier 8 armor
block<00:01:40.369> then<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.940> place<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.600> second

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
block then when you place down a second

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.320 
block then when you place down a second
notice<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.770> texture<00:01:46.770> connects<00:01:47.330> there's

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
notice how the texture connects there's

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.929 
notice how the texture connects there's
no<00:01:48.600> indentation<00:01:49.470> between<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.670> looks

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
no indentation between them it looks

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289 
no indentation between them it looks
like<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.390> large<00:01:51.659> plate<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.260> armor<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:54.060> also

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
like one large plate of armor this also

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.820 
like one large plate of armor this also
works<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.900> any<00:01:55.350> other<00:01:55.799> blocks<00:01:56.689> such<00:01:57.689> as

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
works for any other blocks such as

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.420 
works for any other blocks such as
angled<00:01:58.830> pieces<00:01:59.299> inners<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.430> however

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
angled pieces inners and so on however

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.789 
angled pieces inners and so on however
if<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.479> player<00:02:03.630> were<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> place<00:02:04.229> down<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
if the player were to place down a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.330 
if the player were to place down a
second<00:02:05.400> tier<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> armor<00:02:06.210> say<00:02:07.110> tier<00:02:07.799> 9<00:02:08.069> for

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
second tier of armor say tier 9 for

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.959 
second tier of armor say tier 9 for
example<00:02:08.899> they<00:02:09.899> won't<00:02:10.200> connect<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.769> they<00:02:11.760> use

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
example they won't connect as they use

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.910 
example they won't connect as they use
two<00:02:12.299> separate<00:02:12.749> texture<00:02:13.139> maps

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
two separate texture maps

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.850 
two separate texture maps
they<00:02:14.220> can't<00:02:14.490> possibly<00:02:14.730> connect<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.590> fact

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
they can't possibly connect the fact

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120 
they can't possibly connect the fact
that<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.160> use<00:02:17.340> texture<00:02:17.880> maps<00:02:18.709> still<00:02:19.709> allows

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that they use texture maps still allows

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.280 
that they use texture maps still allows
the<00:02:20.370> player<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:21.060> which<00:02:21.360> type<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.720> armor

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the player to know which type of armor

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.970 
the player to know which type of armor
the<00:02:22.590> enemy<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.950> using<00:02:24.349> even<00:02:25.349> if<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.650> color<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the enemy is using even if they color it

just to you at least that I've thought

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.500

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
array of preset colors or you could have
