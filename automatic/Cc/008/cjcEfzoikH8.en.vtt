I flew with diamond test pilot Rob
Johnson<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.860> ways<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.220> da20<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
Johnson in some ways the da20 is the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
Johnson in some ways the da20 is the
perfect<00:00:48.660> candidate<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.140> minimal<00:00:49.649> glass

perfect candidate for minimal glass

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
perfect candidate for minimal glass
because<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> airplanes<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
because of the airplanes and here in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
because of the airplanes and here in
simplicity<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> shame<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> diamond

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
simplicity it's a shame that diamond
