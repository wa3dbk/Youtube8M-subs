in this video on to localize drawing of

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.920 
in this video on to localize drawing of
a<00:00:03.330> hyperbola<00:00:04.069> using<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> compass<00:00:05.690> I've<00:00:06.690> set

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
a hyperbola using the compass I've set

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.459 
a hyperbola using the compass I've set
up<00:00:07.049> here<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.799> transverse<00:00:08.280> axis<00:00:08.519> v1<00:00:09.120> v2<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.780> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
up here the transverse axis v1 v2 and I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.209 
up here the transverse axis v1 v2 and I
found<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.099> two<00:00:11.250> focal<00:00:11.580> points<00:00:11.849> F<00:00:12.090> 1<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.420> F<00:00:12.540> 2

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
found the two focal points F 1 and F 2

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.310 
found the two focal points F 1 and F 2
the<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.400> thing<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.610> need<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.719> find<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the first thing you need to do is find a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680 
the first thing you need to do is find a
copy<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> random<00:00:17.100> points<00:00:17.430> right<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
copy of random points right here to the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.300 
copy of random points right here to the
rate<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.529> F<00:00:19.800> 2<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> measure<00:00:21.930> them<00:00:22.220> or<00:00:23.220> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
rate of F 2 you can measure them or you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
rate of F 2 you can measure them or you
can<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.550> mark<00:00:23.670> them<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:24.810> doing<00:00:25.019> here

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
can just mark them in as I'm doing here

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.349 
can just mark them in as I'm doing here
if<00:00:25.410> you're<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> hurry<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:27.000> mark<00:00:27.210> them

if you're in a hurry you just mark them

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.040 
if you're in a hurry you just mark them
in<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.609> I'll<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.820> label<00:00:30.000> them<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.510> B

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in like that I'll just label them a B

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
in like that I'll just label them a B
and<00:00:31.199> C<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.969> the<00:00:32.969> first<00:00:33.149> thing<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.329> going

the<00:00:58.530> axis<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.820> thing<00:01:02.940> I've<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.180> here

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the axis the next thing I've done here

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740 
the axis the next thing I've done here
is<00:01:04.229> set<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> second<00:01:04.949> radius<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:06.420> plane<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
is set a second radius to plane to the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.560 
is set a second radius to plane to the
compass<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.320> v1<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.939> opened<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> pen<00:01:09.450> out

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
compass in v1 and I opened the pen out

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
compass in v1 and I opened the pen out
as<00:01:09.720> far<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.760> I'm<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.770> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
as far as a I'm going to use then that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
as far as a I'm going to use then that
radius<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:15.299> come<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:15.659> F<00:01:15.810> 1<00:01:17.420> copy<00:01:18.420> arc<00:01:18.720> above

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
radius to come from F 1 copy arc above

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.580 
radius to come from F 1 copy arc above
and<00:01:19.860> below<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.810> across<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:26.130> F<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and below and then go across to F to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.800 
and below and then go across to F to
find<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.310> opposite<00:01:29.640> points

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
find the opposite points

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.170 
find the opposite points
now<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.020> continue<00:01:33.230> that<00:01:33.760> using<00:01:34.760> points<00:01:35.030> B

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
now if you continue that using points B

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.930 
now if you continue that using points B
and<00:01:35.210> C<00:01:35.560> you'll<00:01:36.560> find<00:01:36.740> an<00:01:36.860> eight<00:01:36.980> locus<00:01:37.820> of

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
and C you'll find an eight locus of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.420 
and C you'll find an eight locus of
points<00:01:38.120> here<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.380> will<00:01:40.220> enable

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
points here and here that will enable

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.810 
points here and here that will enable
you<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.640> find<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:41.570> double<00:01:41.840> hyperbola<00:01:42.820> each

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
you to find the double hyperbola each

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.450 
you to find the double hyperbola each
one<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.150> these<00:01:44.240> planes<00:01:44.540> then<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.500> found<00:01:45.860> by

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
one of these planes then is found by

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.330 
one of these planes then is found by
setting<00:01:46.670> your<00:01:46.880> compass<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.840> vertex<00:01:48.440> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
setting your compass in the vertex and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.240 
setting your compass in the vertex and
opening<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:49.850> outside<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.479> B<00:01:50.660> or<00:01:50.810> C<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.650> then

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
opening it outside of a B or C and then

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.370 
opening it outside of a B or C and then
taking<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.700> radius<00:01:53.180> putting<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
taking that radius putting it in the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
taking that radius putting it in the
focus<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.260> swinging<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.380> arc<00:01:57.530> from<00:01:58.310> the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
focus and then swinging the arc from the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.460 
focus and then swinging the arc from the
opposite<00:01:59.740> focal<00:02:00.740> points<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:02.570> for<00:02:02.720> example<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
opposite focal points so for example the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.139 
opposite focal points so for example the
outer<00:02:03.649> one<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.570> V<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:06.110> see

here<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:34.430> one<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> curves<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
here on one of the curves the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890 
here on one of the curves the
interesting<00:02:37.040> thing<00:02:37.190> about<00:02:37.220> P<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:38.780> you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
interesting thing about P is that if you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.009 
interesting thing about P is that if you
take<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.200> distance<00:02:39.380> from<00:02:39.980> F<00:02:40.220> 1<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:41.090> P<00:02:41.299> and

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
take the distance from F 1 to P and

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.120 
take the distance from F 1 to P and
subtract<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.739> distance<00:02:43.130> from<00:02:43.850> P<00:02:44.090> 2<00:02:44.720> F<00:02:44.900> 2<00:02:45.130> you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
subtract the distance from P 2 F 2 you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.449 
subtract the distance from P 2 F 2 you
end<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.610> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.269> distance<00:02:47.680> from<00:02:48.680> v1<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.160> v2

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
end up with the distance from v1 to v2

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.570 
end up with the distance from v1 to v2

can<00:03:26.120> come<00:03:26.269> up<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> question<00:03:26.720> where<00:03:27.470> you're

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
can come up with a question where you're

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.440 
can come up with a question where you're
given<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:27.920> tangent<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.700> perhaps<00:03:29.150> that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
given that tangent and perhaps that

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.720 
given that tangent and perhaps that
angle<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.829> now<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.070> can<00:03:31.280> see<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.579> if<00:03:31.640> you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
angle and now you can see that if you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.640 
angle and now you can see that if you
just<00:03:31.880> double<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.209> angle<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:33.260> will<00:03:33.410> give<00:03:33.560> you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
just double that angle it will give you

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.080 
just double that angle it will give you
the<00:03:33.799> lane<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.310> which<00:03:34.700> F<00:03:35.570> 1<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.410> be<00:03:36.500> found<00:03:36.769> and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the lane on which F 1 is to be found and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.819 
the lane on which F 1 is to be found and
then<00:03:38.090> using<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> construction<00:03:39.049> I<00:03:39.230> showed<00:03:39.709> you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
then using the construction I showed you

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.729 
then using the construction I showed you
earlier<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:40.669> can<00:03:40.850> work<00:03:41.060> out<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:41.650> using<00:03:42.650> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
earlier you can work out then using the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.320 
earlier you can work out then using the
transverse<00:03:43.220> axis<00:03:43.459> where

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
transverse axis where

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.320 
transverse axis where
exactly<00:03:44.660> f1<00:03:44.990> maybe
