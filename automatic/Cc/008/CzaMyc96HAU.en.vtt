has<00:00:45.780> more<00:00:46.200> moisture<00:00:46.440> content<00:00:47.100> hence<00:00:47.399> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
has more moisture content hence it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
has more moisture content hence it's
more<00:00:48.000> soft<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.899> other<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.590> harder

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
more soft the other one which is harder

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.689 
more soft the other one which is harder
is<00:00:50.629> probably<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> delt<00:00:52.020> rated<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.489> some

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is probably a delt rated also with some

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.600 
is probably a delt rated also with some
flour<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.660> put<00:00:55.020> 2<00:00:55.260> gotta<00:00:55.530> there

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
flour you know put 2 gotta there

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.470 
flour you know put 2 gotta there
the<00:00:57.030> Atta<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.329> added<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the Atta that you get that is added to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
the Atta that you get that is added to
it<00:01:00.600> hence<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> becomes<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.559> hard<00:01:01.829> also

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it hence it becomes little hard also

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.939 
it hence it becomes little hard also
this<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> very<00:01:03.690> soft<00:01:03.989> paneer<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.769> what

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this one is a very soft paneer so what

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.880 
this one is a very soft paneer so what
do<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> need<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.290> cut<00:01:07.290> paneer<00:01:07.619> into

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
do you need to do is cut paneer into

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.630 
do you need to do is cut paneer into
little<00:01:08.549> large<00:01:08.820> pieces<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
little large pieces like like this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
little large pieces like like this
little<00:01:11.640> large<00:01:12.000> pieces<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.049> see

little large pieces like this as you see

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.270 
little large pieces like this as you see
no<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> should<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.250> thick<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.280> make

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
no it should be this thick and make

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.190 
no it should be this thick and make
squares<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.470> ones<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.700> edges

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
squares of the the ones which are edges

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
squares of the the ones which are edges
probably<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> keep<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.189> make<00:01:23.369> other

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
probably you keep them to make other

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
probably you keep them to make other
dishes<00:01:24.270> maybe<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> mutter<00:01:25.020> paneer<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.130> paneer

of water and check the consistency

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.390 
of water and check the consistency
because<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.359> becomes<00:03:33.480> thin<00:03:34.169> then<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.250> need

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
because if it becomes thin then you need

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.909 
because if it becomes thin then you need
to<00:03:35.549> add<00:03:35.669> more<00:03:35.700> grandpa<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.900> batter<00:03:37.169> should

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
to add more grandpa the batter should

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.949 
to add more grandpa the batter should
not<00:03:38.069> be<00:03:38.220> very<00:03:38.430> thin<00:03:38.819> because<00:03:39.269> what's<00:03:39.720> going<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
not be very thin because what's going to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.650 
not be very thin because what's going to
happen<00:03:40.319> is<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.130> thin<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.730> coating<00:03:42.150> is

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
happen is if it's thin the coating is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.659 
happen is if it's thin the coating is
very<00:03:42.750> thin<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.410> top<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.799> it's<00:03:44.280> not<00:03:44.430> going<00:03:44.609> to

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
very thin on top and it's not going to

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.490 
very thin on top and it's not going to
be<00:03:44.730> appropriate<00:03:45.030> probably<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.959> will<00:03:46.049> also

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
be appropriate probably it will also

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.830 
be appropriate probably it will also
leave<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.950> surface<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.790> paneer<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
leave this surface of the paneer so the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.900 
leave this surface of the paneer so the
batter<00:03:49.049> needs<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.859> thick<00:03:50.099> this<00:03:50.849> is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
batter needs to be this thick this is

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.690 
batter needs to be this thick this is
ready<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.959> can<00:03:51.989> rest<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.799> for<00:03:52.829> around<00:03:53.250> 5
