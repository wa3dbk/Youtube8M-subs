00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
straight which just isn't going to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.000 
straight which just isn't going to
happen<00:01:17.150> it's<00:01:17.300> not<00:01:17.360> conducive<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:18.140> plane<00:01:18.620> and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
happen it's not conducive to plane and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.980 
happen it's not conducive to plane and
is<00:01:19.430> going<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.760> cause<00:01:19.970> more<00:01:20.270> problems<00:01:20.330> that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
plane stance many times people will

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.140 
plane stance many times people will
start<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> play<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:45.650> they<00:01:46.490> will<00:01:46.700> sort<00:01:47.000> of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
start to play and then they will sort of

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.390 
start to play and then they will sort of
settle<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.020> they'll<00:01:48.500> lean<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.130> side

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.520 
it comes you start playing you get a
little<00:02:02.180> tired<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.690> you're<00:02:02.840> not<00:02:03.050> moving<00:02:03.260> around

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
little tired if you're not moving around

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.550 
little tired if you're not moving around
you<00:02:04.100> naturally<00:02:04.820> start<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.450> lean<00:02:05.810> well<00:02:06.380> when

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you naturally start to lean well when

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.910 
you naturally start to lean well when
you<00:02:06.680> lean<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.910> makes<00:02:08.300> muscles<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:09.319> your<00:02:09.379> back

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you lean that makes muscles in your back

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.890 
you lean that makes muscles in your back
tighten<00:02:10.489> up<00:02:10.610> because<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.150> pelvis<00:02:11.599> tells

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
tighten up because your pelvis tells

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020 
tighten up because your pelvis tells
here's<00:02:12.230> your<00:02:12.379> pelvis<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.220> lean<00:02:13.519> like<00:02:13.760> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
here's your pelvis you lean like that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.020 
here's your pelvis you lean like that
now<00:02:14.569> you're<00:02:14.840> at<00:02:14.989> an<00:02:15.080> angle<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.580> going

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
now you're at an angle and that's going

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.479 
now you're at an angle and that's going
to<00:02:17.180> cause<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.750> spine<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.349> curve<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.980> muscles

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
to cause the spine to curve the muscles

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.100 
to cause the spine to curve the muscles
in<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.640> back

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
in the back

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.550 
in the back
and<00:02:20.860> that's<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> maybe<00:02:22.570> not<00:02:22.930> bother<00:02:23.260> you

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and that's going to maybe not bother you

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
and that's going to maybe not bother you
immediately<00:02:24.100> for<00:02:24.460> some<00:02:24.640> people<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> will<00:02:25.300> but

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
immediately for some people it will but

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.050 
immediately for some people it will but
for<00:02:26.080> many<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.530> will<00:02:26.650> become<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> learn<00:02:27.280> behavior

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
for many it will become a learn behavior

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360 
for many it will become a learn behavior
and<00:02:28.300> you'll<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:28.960> automatically<00:02:29.620> go<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.160> do

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
and you'll just automatically go and do

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.070 
and you'll just automatically go and do
this<00:02:30.580> every<00:02:30.940> time<00:02:30.970> you're<00:02:31.330> doing<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.690> gig<00:02:31.900> or

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
this every time you're doing a gig or

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.110 
this every time you're doing a gig or
plane<00:02:32.380> when<00:02:32.980> standing<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.550> you'll<00:02:33.790> sort<00:02:34.030> of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
plane when standing up you'll sort of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120 
plane when standing up you'll sort of
lean<00:02:34.390> into<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.050> that'll<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.710> your<00:02:35.890> go-to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
lean into it and that'll be your go-to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.940 
lean into it and that'll be your go-to
position<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.660> will<00:02:37.960> cause<00:02:38.290> problems

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
position and that will cause problems

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.400 
position and that will cause problems
again<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> spine<00:02:40.330> curving<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
again with the spine curving with the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.220 
again with the spine curving with the
pelvis<00:02:41.950> being<00:02:42.310> tilted<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.090> with<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> muscles

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
pelvis being tilted and with the muscles

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.900 
pelvis being tilted and with the muscles
that<00:02:44.350> are<00:02:44.410> tightening<00:02:44.830> up<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.370> that's<00:02:45.700> this

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
that are tightening up so that's this

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.380 
that are tightening up so that's this
day<00:02:46.240> on<00:02:47.050> both<00:02:47.500> feet<00:02:47.830> sort<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.490> balance

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
day on both feet sort of balance

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.330 
day on both feet sort of balance
yourself<00:02:49.540> evenly<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.680> take<00:02:50.860> note<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.130> that

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
yourself evenly and take note of that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.010 
yourself evenly and take note of that
before<00:02:51.700> you're<00:02:51.880> playing<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.660> you're
