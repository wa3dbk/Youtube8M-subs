00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
I'm okay with it at the moment I am I've

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.330 
I'm okay with it at the moment I am I've
got<00:01:39.780> banana<00:01:40.170> celebrity<00:01:41.130> slim<00:01:41.459> which<00:01:42.079> my

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
got banana celebrity slim which my

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.809 
got banana celebrity slim which my
dietitian<00:01:44.340> didn't<00:01:44.610> recommend<00:01:44.969> for<00:01:45.869> me

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
dietitian didn't recommend for me

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.160 
dietitian didn't recommend for me
because<00:01:47.819> they're<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.179> made<00:01:48.390> by<00:01:48.600> doctor<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because they're not made by doctor I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
because they're not made by doctor I
think<00:01:49.259> they've<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.189> more

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
think they've got a little bit more

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
think they've got a little bit more
sugar<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.789> stuff<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.319> sometimes

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
sugar and stuff in them but sometimes

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.039 
sugar and stuff in them but sometimes

only<00:02:34.470> got<00:02:34.709> three<00:02:35.010> weeks<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.519> Anna<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
only got three weeks to go Anna and I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.430 
only got three weeks to go Anna and I
think<00:02:36.269> I'll<00:02:36.389> be<00:02:36.510> able<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.840> through<00:02:37.109> it<00:02:37.139> I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
think I'll be able to get through it I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.599 
think I'll be able to get through it I
think<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:38.359> think<00:02:39.359> I'll<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.690> fine<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.709> I've<00:02:41.400> done

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
think I think I'll be fine if I've done

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.309 
think I think I'll be fine if I've done
two<00:02:41.819> weeks<00:02:42.000> already<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.600> know<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.200> do

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
two weeks already I know I can do

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.300 
two weeks already I know I can do
another<00:02:43.560> three<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:45.000> I'm<00:02:45.450> already<00:02:45.720> down<00:02:46.310> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
another three now I'm already down it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.599 
another three now I'm already down it's
just<00:02:47.790> under<00:02:48.299> ten<00:02:48.540> kilos<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.410> two<00:02:49.980> weeks<00:02:50.250> so

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
just under ten kilos in two weeks so

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.720 
just under ten kilos in two weeks so
it's<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.510> lot<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.840> way<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:53.459> see<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it's a it's a lot of way and I can see a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.360 
it's a it's a lot of way and I can see a
difference<00:02:54.709> definitely<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.889> everyone<00:02:56.220> else

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
difference definitely and everyone else

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900 
difference definitely and everyone else
can<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:58.010> when<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.040> first<00:02:59.130> went<00:02:59.700> into

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
can but I think when I first went into

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.319 
can but I think when I first went into
the<00:02:59.970> diet

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
the diet

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.659 
the diet
I<00:03:00.359> was<00:03:00.480> extremely<00:03:00.840> bloated<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:02.810> just<00:03:03.810> very

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
I was extremely bloated and just very

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.449 
I was extremely bloated and just very
unhealthy<00:03:06.049> so<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.680> first<00:03:07.919> couple<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.250> days

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
unhealthy so in the first couple of days

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.000 
unhealthy so in the first couple of days
it's<00:03:08.790> sort<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.120> all<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.169> water<00:03:10.380> attention

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
it's sort of all the water attention

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.199 
it's sort of all the water attention
went<00:03:11.609> away<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:13.109> dropped<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.980> lot<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
went away and I just dropped a lot of

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.750 
went away and I just dropped a lot of
weight<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.530> time<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:17.549> been

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
weight in that time and then it's been

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.690 
weight in that time and then it's been
slowly<00:03:18.150> over<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.599> last<00:03:18.720> two<00:03:18.959> weeks<00:03:19.489> I've<00:03:20.489> also

I've<00:03:22.560> lost<00:03:23.400> loads<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.060> energy<00:03:24.180> since<00:03:25.019> starting

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
I've lost loads of energy since starting

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
do things around the house to keep him

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.930 
do things around the house to keep him
keep<00:04:06.610> my<00:04:06.840> energy<00:04:07.840> levels<00:04:08.170> going<00:04:08.470> my<00:04:09.130> dietician

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
keep my energy levels going my dietician

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.600 
keep my energy levels going my dietician
said<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.510> me<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.890> any<00:04:11.890> weight<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.400> lose

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
said to me that any weight that I lose

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.610 
said to me that any weight that I lose
before<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.060> surgery<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.690> don't<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.440> put

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
before the surgery I don't have to put

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.729 
before the surgery I don't have to put
on<00:04:14.740> again<00:04:14.860> I'm<00:04:15.400> not<00:04:15.670> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.180> put<00:04:16.360> on<00:04:16.480> again

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
on again I'm not going to put on again

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.760 
on again I'm not going to put on again
so<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:19.000> actually<00:04:19.180> sort<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.930> motivated<00:04:20.470> me<00:04:20.739> to

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
so it actually sort of motivated me to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.460 
so it actually sort of motivated me to
try<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.250> lose<00:04:21.520> as<00:04:21.730> much<00:04:21.940> as<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.360> could<00:04:22.420> from<00:04:23.410> the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
try and lose as much as I could from the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.430 
try and lose as much as I could from the
moment<00:04:23.920> I<00:04:23.980> saw<00:04:24.280> her<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.600> thought<00:04:25.810> yeah<00:04:26.170> why

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
moment I saw her and I thought yeah why

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.230 
moment I saw her and I thought yeah why
not<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:26.800> get<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.190> started<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:27.790> instead<00:04:28.090> of

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
not just get it started then instead of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.720 
not just get it started then instead of
waiting<00:04:28.420> for<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.750> surgery<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:29.550> I'll<00:04:30.550> keep

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
waiting for the surgery so I'll keep
