hey<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.400> ponts<00:00:08.820> making<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.420> another

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
hey this is ponts making a another

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.459 
hey this is ponts making a another
recording<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:11.269> I'm<00:00:12.269> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.870> be<00:00:12.960> making<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
recording here I'm going to be making a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.129 
recording here I'm going to be making a
series<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> videos<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.790> based<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.780> basically

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
series of videos here based on basically

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.040 
series of videos here based on basically
my<00:00:16.260> five<00:00:16.529> principles<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.270> feel<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
my five principles that I feel are the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.740 
my five principles that I feel are the
fastest<00:00:19.650> way<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> best<00:00:20.369> ways<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.939> sort<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
fastest way or the best ways to sort of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.269 
fastest way or the best ways to sort of
improve<00:00:22.020> your<00:00:22.230> game<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> hopefully<00:00:22.890> start

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
improve your game and hopefully start

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.870 
improve your game and hopefully start
getting<00:00:23.490> high<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:23.699> low<00:00:24.710> as<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.369> better<00:00:26.550> at

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
getting high or low as you get better at

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
getting high or low as you get better at
them<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.109> originates<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.769> basically<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
them it all originates from basically a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.910 
them it all originates from basically a
lot<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> questions<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.630> i<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
lot of questions i get i get in the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.260 
lot of questions i get i get in the
youtube<00:00:32.219> comments<00:00:33.260> in<00:00:34.260> particular<00:00:34.680> i<00:00:35.270> get

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
youtube comments in particular i get

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670 
youtube comments in particular i get
though<00:00:36.480> i<00:00:36.750> used<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.320> actually<00:00:37.590> this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
though i used to get actually this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
though i used to get actually this
question<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.520> why<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.000> click

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
question a lot is like why do you click

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.819 
question a lot is like why do you click
so<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> click<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.649> over

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so much and why do you click all over

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
so much and why do you click all over
the<00:00:40.920> screen<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.320> could

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the screen this is back when you could

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.869 
the screen this is back when you could
hear<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.800> clicking<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> lot<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
hear my clicking a lot more because I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.900 
hear my clicking a lot more because I
different<00:00:45.180> sound<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.930> under<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
different sound I was under a so this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
different sound I was under a so this
led<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> thinking<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.200> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
led me to thinking and then this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.540 
led me to thinking and then this
basically<00:00:49.710> led<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:51.829> me<00:00:52.829> coming<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.399> bow

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
basically led to me coming up with bow

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.639 
basically led to me coming up with bow
basic<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.120> basic<00:00:54.570> laying<00:00:54.870> mechanics<00:00:55.440> kind

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
basic it's a basic laying mechanics kind

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.900 
basic it's a basic laying mechanics kind
of<00:00:55.739> thing<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.219> fed<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.760> whole

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of thing but then that fed into a whole

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
of thing but then that fed into a whole
bunch<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> other<00:00:57.239> things<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.289> basically<00:00:58.680> these

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
bunch of other things so basically these

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.700 
bunch of other things so basically these
five<00:00:59.190> principles<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.910> came<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.899> sort

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
five principles I came up with to sort

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
five principles I came up with to sort
of<00:01:01.800> improving<00:01:02.520> your<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> basically<00:01:04.460> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of improving your game or basically one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
of improving your game or basically one
lane<00:01:06.119> mechanics<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.200> obvious

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
lane mechanics that's very obvious

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
lane mechanics that's very obvious
that's<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.130> we'll<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.310> focusing<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that's the one we'll be focusing on this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's the one we'll be focusing on this
game<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.510> basic<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> may

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
game it's the most basic one so you may

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.109 
game it's the most basic one so you may
want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> move<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> next<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
want to move on to the next one if you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.460 
want to move on to the next one if you
know<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> feel<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:13.110> good<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.380> your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
know if you feel you're good with your

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
know if you feel you're good with your
lane<00:01:13.680> mechanics<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> lame

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
lane mechanics to is a lame

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
lane mechanics to is a lame
decision-making<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:17.009> ties<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> very

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
decision-making which ties in very

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.780 
decision-making which ties in very
closely<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.420> Lane<00:01:18.840> mechanics<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.830> they're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
closely with Lane mechanics and they're

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
closely with Lane mechanics and they're
almost<00:01:20.909> inseparable<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.900> hard<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
almost inseparable so it's hard to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
almost inseparable so it's hard to
separate<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.680> two<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.159> try<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
separate these two but I'll try not to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.010 
separate these two but I'll try not to
talk<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.330> too<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.570> even<00:01:24.900> though

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
talk about this one too much even though

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
talk about this one too much even though
I'm<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:26.270> third<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> sort<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I'm going to want to third is sort of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.410 
I'm going to want to third is sort of
your<00:01:27.950> basic<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> tactical<00:01:29.790> sense<00:01:30.090> sort

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
your basic kind of tactical sense sort

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.819 
your basic kind of tactical sense sort
of<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.570> overview<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.320> needs<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.740> get

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
of your overview of what needs to get

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.399 
of your overview of what needs to get
done<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.520> map<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.299> leads<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.110> into

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
done on the map this leads more into

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
done on the map this leads more into
sort<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> teamfight<00:01:35.009> phase<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
sort of the teamfight phase and when you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
sort of the teamfight phase and when you
start<00:01:36.750> getting<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> laning<00:01:37.590> phase

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
start getting out of the laning phase

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
start getting out of the laning phase
although<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.189> important<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> laning<00:01:38.759> phase

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
although it's important in laning phase

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.569 
although it's important in laning phase
as<00:01:39.240> well<00:01:39.450> sometimes<00:01:40.439> there's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.250> teamfight

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
as well sometimes there's a teamfight

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
as well sometimes there's a teamfight
mechanics<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.899> different<00:01:43.110> from

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
mechanics which are very different from

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.639 
mechanics which are very different from
laning<00:01:43.740> mechanics<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> completely

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
laning mechanics it's a completely

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.840 
laning mechanics it's a completely
different<00:01:46.920> set<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> skills<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.549> that's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
different set of skills so that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.130 
different set of skills so that's
something<00:01:48.030> else<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> work<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
something else you need to work with and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.980 
something else you need to work with and
five<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.649> sort<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> most<00:01:50.159> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.299> guess

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
five is sort of the most kind of I guess

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
five is sort of the most kind of I guess
theoretical<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.310> kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.759> almost

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
theoretical and kind of almost

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789 
theoretical and kind of almost
philosophical<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.810> guess<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.560> more

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
philosophical I guess and it's more

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.980 
philosophical I guess and it's more
about<00:01:55.939> people<00:01:56.939> managing<00:01:57.390> skills<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
about people managing skills and it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
about people managing skills and it's
more<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:59.130> ability<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> deal<00:01:59.909> with

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
more about your ability to deal with

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
more about your ability to deal with
people<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.630> i'll<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.229> last

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
people and i'll get to that one last

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.999 
people and i'll get to that one last
because<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.340> probably<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> most<00:02:03.390> difficult

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
because it's probably the most difficult

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.660 
because it's probably the most difficult
for<00:02:05.009> some<00:02:05.189> people<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.530> yeah<00:02:07.920> odds<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.610> i'm

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
for some people but yeah odds are i'm

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.249 
for some people but yeah odds are i'm
going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> skip<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> chunk<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.720> video<00:02:09.959> here

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
going to skip out a chunk of video here

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
going to skip out a chunk of video here
so<00:02:10.289> you're<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.069> jumping<00:02:11.489> into

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so you're going to see me jumping into

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.080 
so you're going to see me jumping into
when<00:02:12.030> i<00:02:12.060> start<00:02:12.330> talking<00:02:12.660> about<00:02:12.750> real

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
when i start talking about real

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
when i start talking about real
than<00:02:13.209> points<00:02:13.599> in<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:14.290> game<00:02:14.349> or<00:02:14.680> different

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
than points in this game or different

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.240 
than points in this game or different
games<00:02:15.450> so

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.800 

so<00:02:23.250> basically<00:02:23.760> what<00:02:23.879> i<00:02:23.909> mean<00:02:24.209> by<00:02:24.420> late<00:02:24.659> or

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so basically what i mean by late or

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.420 
so basically what i mean by late or
rather<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.170> i<00:02:25.230> want<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.440> focus<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.370> terms

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
rather what i want to focus on in terms

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.430 
rather what i want to focus on in terms
of<00:02:26.760> lane<00:02:26.970> mechanics<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.750> obviously<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> very

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
of lane mechanics it's obviously a very

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
of lane mechanics it's obviously a very
expansive<00:02:28.830> topic<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.489> i<00:02:29.549> was<00:02:29.670> saying<00:02:29.940> earlier

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
expansive topic as i was saying earlier

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.630 
expansive topic as i was saying earlier
but<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.290> things<00:02:31.349> most<00:02:31.920> fundamental

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
but one of the things most fundamental

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.390 
but one of the things most fundamental
things<00:02:32.819> already<00:02:33.150> mechanics<00:02:33.599> i<00:02:33.690> find<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
things already mechanics i find is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.259 
things already mechanics i find is
understanding<00:02:35.400> what<00:02:35.519> i<00:02:35.549> like<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.790> call<00:02:35.849> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
understanding what i like to call the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.380 
understanding what i like to call the
your<00:02:36.599> characters<00:02:37.110> zone<00:02:37.650> threat<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.030> basically

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
your characters zone threat so basically

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
your characters zone threat so basically
in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.510> case<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.690> rumble<00:02:40.200> his<00:02:40.319> zone<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.680> threat

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
in the case of rumble his zone of threat

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
in the case of rumble his zone of threat
encompasses<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> entire<00:02:41.640> range<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.299> his

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
encompasses the entire range of his

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.229 
encompasses the entire range of his
electoral<00:02:42.780> harpoon<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.549> until<00:02:44.549> slightly

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
electoral harpoon and until slightly

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
electoral harpoon and until slightly
lesser<00:02:45.660> extent<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.170> distance<00:02:46.769> he<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.040> cover

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
lesser extent the distance he can cover

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.009 
lesser extent the distance he can cover
and<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:47.790> hit<00:02:47.970> ppl<00:02:48.269> electric<00:02:48.390> oven<00:02:48.870> so

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
and then hit ppl electric oven so

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.479 
and then hit ppl electric oven so
basically<00:02:49.319> imagine<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.860> bubble<00:02:50.280> surrounding

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
basically imagine a bubble surrounding

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.880 
basically imagine a bubble surrounding
your<00:02:50.879> character<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.840> distance<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.560> electoral

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
your character the distance of electoral

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.710 
your character the distance of electoral
heartburn<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.489> case<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> rumble<00:02:54.150> it's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
heartburn in the case of rumble it's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.520 
heartburn in the case of rumble it's
sort<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.079> i'd<00:02:55.860> say<00:02:56.209> like<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> yellow<00:02:57.780> circle<00:02:58.230> or

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
sort of i'd say like a yellow circle or

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.080 
sort of i'd say like a yellow circle or
something<00:02:58.799> kind<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> indicating<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.579> mid-level

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
something kind of indicating a mid-level

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.039 
something kind of indicating a mid-level
threat<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.780> he<00:03:00.870> presents<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.930> then

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
threat that he presents with it and then

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.990 
threat that he presents with it and then
on<00:03:04.170> top<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.500> he<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.829> he<00:03:05.280> has<00:03:05.400> another<00:03:05.670> zone<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
on top that he is he has another zone a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.729 
on top that he is he has another zone a
threat<00:03:06.299> with<00:03:06.720> flames<00:03:07.019> bitter<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:07.650> in

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
threat with flames bitter so right in

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.380 
threat with flames bitter so right in
front<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.549> cone<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.090> when

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
front of them you can that cone and when

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.390 
front of them you can that cone and when
the<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.660> stack<00:03:10.019> electro<00:03:10.530> harpoon<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.129> flames

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the to stack electro harpoon and flames

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.940 
the to stack electro harpoon and flames
bitter<00:03:11.700> stack<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.349> quite<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> powerful

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
bitter stack you have quite a powerful

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430 
bitter stack you have quite a powerful
zone<00:03:14.430> threat<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.150> why<00:03:15.329> movement<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.349> i

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
zone threat and that's why movement as i

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.080 
zone threat and that's why movement as i
was<00:03:16.560> saying<00:03:16.739> earlier<00:03:16.859> continue<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.819> change

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
was saying earlier continue to change

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.240 
was saying earlier continue to change
that<00:03:18.390> zona<00:03:18.690> threat<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.140> zed<00:03:19.590> always<00:03:19.890> has<00:03:20.069> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that zona threat and zed always has to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.440 
that zona threat and zed always has to
the<00:03:20.370> enemies<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.730> has<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> continuously

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the enemies that has to continuously

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.190 
the enemies that has to continuously
yeah<00:03:21.810> we<00:03:22.500> evaluate<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.849> I'm<00:03:23.970> capable<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.540> in

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
yeah we evaluate what I'm capable of in

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.800 
yeah we evaluate what I'm capable of in
terms<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.069> know<00:03:26.099> can<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.489> kill<00:03:26.790> him<00:03:26.910> can<00:03:27.720> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
terms of you know can I kill him can I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.839 
terms of you know can I kill him can I
not<00:03:28.019> kill<00:03:28.290> him<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.590> then<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.489> said<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.700> wouldn't

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
not kill him and then I said I wouldn't

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.009 
not kill him and then I said I wouldn't
talk<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.630> I'm<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.930> a

talk about this but I'm going to a

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.030 
talk about this but I'm going to a
little<00:03:31.260> bit<00:03:31.349> for<00:03:31.530> example<00:03:31.859> Lane

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
little bit for example Lane

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.589 
little bit for example Lane
decision-making<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.849> also<00:03:33.180> comes<00:03:33.329> into

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
decision-making that also comes into

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.140 
decision-making that also comes into
play<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.169> understanding<00:03:34.919> his<00:03:35.639> own<00:03:35.970> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
play is like understanding his own of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.680 
play is like understanding his own of
threat<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.620> how<00:03:38.099> my<00:03:38.310> interacts<00:03:39.299> with<00:03:39.419> his

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
threat and so how my interacts with his

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.750 
threat and so how my interacts with his
movement<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.799> when<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.280> go<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.609> when

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
movement and like when I can go in when

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.819 
movement and like when I can go in when
I<00:03:41.790> can't<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.480> sort<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> thing<00:03:42.829> but

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
I can't go in that sort of thing but

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.460 
I can't go in that sort of thing but
basically<00:03:44.819> by<00:03:45.150> understanding<00:03:45.750> my<00:03:45.959> zone

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
basically by understanding my zone

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.659 
basically by understanding my zone
threat<00:03:47.329> whenever<00:03:48.329> Zed<00:03:49.400> whatever<00:03:50.400> does<00:03:50.549> that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
threat whenever Zed whatever does that

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.170 
threat whenever Zed whatever does that
decides<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.209> here<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:53.280> idea<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.819> to

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
decides to do here the idea is to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.089 
decides to do here the idea is to
maximize<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.810> damage<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.169> can<00:03:55.349> output<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.799> him

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
maximize the damage I can output on him

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.190 
maximize the damage I can output on him
and<00:03:56.340> minimize<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.389> damage<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.720> outputs<00:03:58.049> on

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and minimize the damage the outputs on

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.750 
and minimize the damage the outputs on
me<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.470> I'm<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.709> old<00:03:58.859> here<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.459> just

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
me and I'm going to old here and just

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.039 
me and I'm going to old here and just
kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> make<00:04:00.120> sure<00:04:00.299> Joe<00:04:00.480> gets<00:04:00.870> away<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.900> yeah

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
kind of make sure Joe gets away so yeah

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.300 
kind of make sure Joe gets away so yeah
that's<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:05.870> but<00:04:06.889> yeah<00:04:07.889> that's<00:04:08.010> another

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that's that but yeah that's another

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.420 
that's that but yeah that's another
factor<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.299> zone<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.810> threat<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.319> my<00:04:10.950> old<00:04:11.160> it's

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
factor of zone of threat is my old it's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.930 
factor of zone of threat is my old it's
very<00:04:11.730> long<00:04:12.120> range<00:04:12.389> one<00:04:12.660> more

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
very long range one more

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.700 
very long range one more
as<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.870> unique<00:04:14.020> character<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.680> that

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
as kind of a unique character in that

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.000 
as kind of a unique character in that
he's<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> very<00:04:15.550> short<00:04:15.910> range<00:04:16.440> zona<00:04:17.440> threat<00:04:17.799> most

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
he's a very short range zona threat most

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.920 
he's a very short range zona threat most
of<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.160> time<00:04:18.370> but<00:04:19.180> he<00:04:19.360> also<00:04:19.510> has<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
of the time but he also has the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.060 
of the time but he also has the
potential<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.380> having<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.680> very<00:04:20.860> high

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
potential of having a very high

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.460 
potential of having a very high
long-range<00:04:22.920> threat<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.210> dying<00:04:25.210> meantime<00:04:25.720> but

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
long-range threat and dying meantime but

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.300 
long-range threat and dying meantime but
I'm<00:04:26.560> not<00:04:26.590> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:26.890> able<00:04:26.920> do<00:04:27.070> anything

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
I'm not going to be able do anything

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.730 
I'm not going to be able do anything
about<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:27.670> I'm<00:04:27.730> schedule<00:04:28.090> back<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.590> what

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
about that so I'm schedule back so what

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.410 
about that so I'm schedule back so what
does<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.980> get<00:04:33.160> back<00:04:33.640> into<00:04:33.850> lane<00:04:34.030> I'll<00:04:34.150> try<00:04:34.390> and

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
does it get back into lane I'll try and

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.470 
does it get back into lane I'll try and
demonstrate<00:04:34.690> what<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.380> mean<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:37.330> particular

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
demonstrate what I mean in particular

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.240 
demonstrate what I mean in particular
flamethrower<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.560> more<00:04:38.740> interesting

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
flamethrower is the more interesting

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.650 
flamethrower is the more interesting
interactions<00:04:39.820> own<00:04:40.030> serve<00:04:40.240> because<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.540> goes

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
interactions own serve because it goes

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.240 
interactions own serve because it goes
behind<00:04:41.200> minions<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.710> he<00:04:41.770> just<00:04:41.950> kind<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.130> this

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
behind minions and he just kind of this

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.680 
behind minions and he just kind of this
AoE<00:04:42.610> that<00:04:43.240> he<00:04:44.200> can't<00:04:44.470> hide<00:04:44.650> behind<00:04:44.710> minions<00:04:45.370> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
AoE that he can't hide behind minions of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.240 
AoE that he can't hide behind minions of
harpoon<00:04:46.690> on<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> other<00:04:47.200> hand<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.740> more<00:04:47.980> kind

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
harpoon on the other hand is more kind

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.710 
harpoon on the other hand is more kind
of<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.370> straightforward<00:04:48.640> skill<00:04:49.180> shots<00:04:49.450> on<00:04:49.690> a

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
of a straightforward skill shots on a

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.500 
of a straightforward skill shots on a
threat<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.200> it's<00:04:50.380> it's<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.520> bubble<00:04:51.880> normally

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
threat so it's it's a bubble normally

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.990 
threat so it's it's a bubble normally
but<00:04:52.750> it's<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.200> malleable<00:04:53.740> bubbly<00:04:54.250> it's<00:04:54.490> more

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
but it's a malleable bubbly it's more

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.730 
but it's a malleable bubbly it's more
like<00:04:55.180> measured<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.840> balloon<00:04:56.140> pressing<00:04:56.650> up

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
like measured a balloon pressing up

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.170 
like measured a balloon pressing up
against<00:04:57.070> these<00:04:57.160> means<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.730> can't<00:04:57.880> go<00:04:58.000> past

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
against these means and it can't go past

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.760 
against these means and it can't go past
them<00:04:58.420> because<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.230> zone<00:04:59.410> afraid<00:04:59.680> he's

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
them because it's the zone afraid he's

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.760 
them because it's the zone afraid he's
always<00:05:00.010> had<00:05:00.130> been<00:05:00.220> cut<00:05:00.460> off<00:05:00.640> by<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.940> minions

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.710 

he<00:05:05.770> was<00:05:05.860> pushed<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.280> power<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:07.210> i<00:05:07.480> don't

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
he was pushed up to power so i don't

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.940 
he was pushed up to power so i don't
know<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:07.870> i<00:05:07.900> can<00:05:07.930> make<00:05:08.140> anything<00:05:08.380> happen<00:05:08.530> but

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
know if i can make anything happen but

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.950 
know if i can make anything happen but
we'll<00:05:09.310> see<00:05:09.490> for<00:05:09.940> example<00:05:10.240> my<00:05:10.360> flame<00:05:10.660> spitter

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
we'll see for example my flame spitter

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.420 
we'll see for example my flame spitter
is<00:05:11.050> actually<00:05:11.290> very<00:05:11.320> good<00:05:11.620> i<00:05:11.680> can<00:05:11.890> go<00:05:12.040> in<00:05:12.280> and

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
is actually very good i can go in and

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.800 
is actually very good i can go in and
out<00:05:12.520> see<00:05:12.730> I<00:05:12.760> poke<00:05:13.060> him<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.270> couple<00:05:13.450> times<00:05:13.570> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
out see I poke him a couple times the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.760 
out see I poke him a couple times the
flame<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:14.200> that's<00:05:14.290> my<00:05:14.590> zone<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:15.010> threat<00:05:15.250> is

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
flame to it that's my zone of threat is

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.840 
flame to it that's my zone of threat is
it's<00:05:17.770> quite<00:05:18.010> good<00:05:18.190> for<00:05:18.310> harassing<00:05:18.580> at<00:05:18.790> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
it's quite good for harassing at the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.640 
it's quite good for harassing at the
time<00:05:18.970> because<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.240> can<00:05:19.390> go<00:05:19.600> in<00:05:19.840> when<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.410> tower

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
time because I can go in when the tower

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.220 
time because I can go in when the tower
is<00:05:21.010> a<00:05:21.240> shooting<00:05:22.240> at<00:05:22.360> me<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:22.750> know<00:05:22.810> when<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
is a shooting at me and I know when the

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.050 
is a shooting at me and I know when the
like<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.890> tower<00:05:24.070> has<00:05:24.160> an<00:05:24.370> attack<00:05:24.610> cool<00:05:24.880> down

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
like the tower has an attack cool down

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.060 
like the tower has an attack cool down
so<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.540> go<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.320> poke<00:05:26.470> them<00:05:26.650> once<00:05:26.830> or<00:05:26.950> twice

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
so I go in and poke them once or twice

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.000 
so I go in and poke them once or twice
with<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.730> flamethrower<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.590> not<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.770> lot

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
with the flamethrower and it's not a lot

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.710 
with the flamethrower and it's not a lot
of<00:05:30.040> damage<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.550> starts<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:30.910> add<00:05:31.060> up<00:05:31.090> you

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
of damage but it starts to add up you

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.020 
of damage but it starts to add up you
know<00:05:31.840> you'll<00:05:31.990> see<00:05:32.200> over<00:05:32.380> time<00:05:32.410> it'll

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.240 

see<00:05:35.570> he<00:05:35.840> gets<00:05:35.990> away<00:05:36.170> there<00:05:36.410> he<00:05:36.560> knows<00:05:36.740> he

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
see he gets away there he knows he

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.740 
see he gets away there he knows he
understands<00:05:37.790> my<00:05:37.940> zone<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.270> threats<00:05:38.450> he<00:05:38.570> said

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
understands my zone of threats he said

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.290 
understands my zone of threats he said
he's<00:05:38.900> saying<00:05:39.170> okay<00:05:39.830> his<00:05:40.040> flamethrower<00:05:40.910> he's

he's saying okay his flamethrower he's
going<00:05:41.480> to<00:05:41.570> damage<00:05:41.750> me<00:05:41.960> quite<00:05:42.290> heavily<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.280> I'm

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
going to damage me quite heavily so I'm

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.900 
going to damage me quite heavily so I'm
going<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.820> have<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.000> give<00:05:44.300> up<00:05:44.330> CS<00:05:44.840> here<00:05:45.200> and

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
going to have to give up CS here and

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:59.070 
going to have to give up CS here and
just<00:05:46.910> back<00:05:47.210> off

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.659 

see<00:05:59.909> he<00:06:00.909> underestimated<00:06:01.689> my<00:06:02.220> basic<00:06:03.220> my<00:06:03.430> burst

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
see he underestimated my basic my burst

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.140 
see he underestimated my basic my burst
potential<00:06:05.220> in<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.400> sense<00:06:06.610> that<00:06:06.699> he<00:06:06.909> didn't

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
potential in the sense that he didn't

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.309 
potential in the sense that he didn't
factor<00:06:07.509> in<00:06:07.629> my<00:06:07.750> alt<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.229> suppose<00:06:10.319> because

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
factor in my alt I suppose because

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.350 
factor in my alt I suppose because
basically<00:06:11.770> when<00:06:12.340> he's<00:06:12.490> really<00:06:12.909> close<00:06:13.090> to<00:06:13.300> me

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
basically when he's really close to me

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.240 
basically when he's really close to me
he's<00:06:13.479> right<00:06:13.750> up<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:14.020> me<00:06:14.110> is<00:06:14.229> Rumble<00:06:14.560> my<00:06:14.919> zona

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
he's right up to me is Rumble my zona

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.709 
he's right up to me is Rumble my zona
threat<00:06:15.580> is<00:06:15.639> absolutely<00:06:16.150> massive<00:06:16.389> like

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
threat is absolutely massive like

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.270 
threat is absolutely massive like
basically<00:06:17.199> that<00:06:17.409> bubble<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.830> was<00:06:17.949> talking

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
basically that bubble I was talking

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.920 
basically that bubble I was talking
about<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.490> color-coded<00:06:19.060> bubble<00:06:19.330> we<00:06:19.509> white

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
about the color-coded bubble we white

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.110 
about the color-coded bubble we white
being<00:06:20.229> the<00:06:20.289> weakest<00:06:20.770> red<00:06:21.280> being<00:06:21.550> strongest

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
being the weakest red being strongest

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.050 
being the weakest red being strongest
when<00:06:22.599> all<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.990> things<00:06:23.169> align<00:06:23.500> my<00:06:23.860> harpoon<00:06:24.490> my

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
when all the things align my harpoon my

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.330 
when all the things align my harpoon my
flames<00:06:25.479> bitter<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:25.990> my<00:06:26.229> alt<00:06:26.469> all<00:06:26.710> at<00:06:26.919> once<00:06:27.099> and

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
flames bitter and my alt all at once and

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.999 
flames bitter and my alt all at once and
sometimes<00:06:28.080> your<00:06:29.080> auto<00:06:29.229> attacks<00:06:29.620> if<00:06:29.770> you're<00:06:29.919> in

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
sometimes your auto attacks if you're in

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.740 
sometimes your auto attacks if you're in
the<00:06:30.129> danger<00:06:30.310> zone<00:06:30.520> if<00:06:30.969> everything<00:06:31.330> aligns

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
the danger zone if everything aligns

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.600 
the danger zone if everything aligns
like<00:06:32.020> in<00:06:32.139> this<00:06:32.259> very<00:06:32.530> small<00:06:32.979> area<00:06:33.430> around

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
like in this very small area around

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.459 
like in this very small area around
Rumble<00:06:34.060> his<00:06:34.180> damage<00:06:34.539> potential<00:06:35.229> becomes

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
Rumble his damage potential becomes

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.209 
Rumble his damage potential becomes
absolutely<00:06:35.919> ludicrous<00:06:36.930> so<00:06:37.930> you<00:06:38.889> know<00:06:38.979> if<00:06:39.099> you

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
absolutely ludicrous so you know if you

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.249 
absolutely ludicrous so you know if you
understand<00:06:39.909> that<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.360> know<00:06:40.479> when<00:06:40.750> you<00:06:40.870> can<00:06:41.020> go

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
understand that and know when you can go

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:42.809 
understand that and know when you can go
in<00:06:41.440> understanding<00:06:42.009> the<00:06:42.099> enemy's<00:06:42.400> cooldowns

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
in understanding the enemy's cooldowns

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.700 
in understanding the enemy's cooldowns
and<00:06:43.000> your<00:06:43.120> cooldowns<00:06:43.569> you<00:06:43.719> can<00:06:43.870> just<00:06:44.020> dump<00:06:44.469> on

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
and your cooldowns you can just dump on

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.540 
and your cooldowns you can just dump on
him<00:06:45.120> and<00:06:46.530> come<00:06:47.530> out<00:06:47.680> successful<00:06:47.919> like<00:06:48.430> I

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
him and come out successful like I

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.100 
him and come out successful like I

with<00:06:55.779> the<00:06:56.319> lane<00:06:57.219> decision-making<00:06:58.180> that'll<00:06:58.539> be

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
with the lane decision-making that'll be

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.730 
with the lane decision-making that'll be
the<00:06:58.689> next<00:06:58.900> video<00:06:59.110> i<00:06:59.169> make<00:06:59.349> it<00:06:59.500> will<00:06:59.590> come<00:06:59.710> up

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.350 
the next video i make it will come up
soon<00:07:00.039> not<00:07:00.310> immediately<00:07:00.759> but<00:07:00.969> in<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.120> next<00:07:01.270> few

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
soon not immediately but in the next few

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.510 
soon not immediately but in the next few
days<00:07:01.509> hopefully<00:07:01.719> i<00:07:01.930> can<00:07:01.990> get<00:07:02.289> it<00:07:02.439> up<00:07:02.590> this

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
days hopefully i can get it up this

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.010 
days hopefully i can get it up this
video<00:07:03.849> in<00:07:04.060> particular<00:07:06.539> if<00:07:07.539> you<00:07:07.659> didn't<00:07:07.870> find

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
video in particular if you didn't find

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.300 
video in particular if you didn't find
it<00:07:08.110> particularly<00:07:08.500> informative<00:07:08.830> i<00:07:09.129> think

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
it particularly informative i think

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.070 
it particularly informative i think
it'll<00:07:09.520> be<00:07:09.639> really<00:07:09.969> informative<00:07:10.690> to<00:07:10.900> some

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
it'll be really informative to some

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.649 
it'll be really informative to some
newer<00:07:11.259> players<00:07:11.620> who<00:07:11.770> don't<00:07:11.800> understand<00:07:12.659> the

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:13.659 
newer players who don't understand the

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:17.279 
newer players who don't understand the
