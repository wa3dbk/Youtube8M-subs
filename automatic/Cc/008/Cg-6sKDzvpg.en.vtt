00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 Our company is also called and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.960
 We have more than 30 years in the market that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.869
 they support our work we dedicate ourselves 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.650
 mainly to the manufacture of 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.270
 vertical stampers and rollers 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310
 Now we are going to present the materials 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.110
 that are occupied for good 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 operation of the marking device 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.020
 Silk for allergies beginning 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
 we need a tub of one meter twenty 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.260
 long 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.260
 in which the device is going to be placed 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.899
 Latina will contain 10 liters of water at 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.379
 which these 10 liters of water is 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.839
 You need to put 250 grams of soap 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.289
 we always recommend soap 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.940
 place the stamped area is 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.460
 You need a crossbar made of wood 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 in which we are going to place the device 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 the wax marker to start 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 occupy it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 let's occupy a shotgun to carve 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.500
 both plates when you are going to start to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 the device the little boat that is 100 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.469
 grams is for the size to come out 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.439
 a marked sheet of 100 grams a key 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.439
 of 516 for measurements or for adjustment 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 of the machine and a knife for 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.240
 cut waste or leftovers 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 Wax the other is made of plastic 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.400
 injected in double resistors 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.400
 to start working 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.120
 we would be with the comet 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.880
 the two other stars 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.530
 and not determined to detail the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.430
 Camon emptied water for that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 do not foam anything else that remains 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.650
 they searched for the plate 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.340
 once we prepare them so 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.280
 we leave open to the centimeter and a half 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.460
 more or less the plates and we take this 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 dinghy already melted wax 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.860
 we have beforehand melted the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 empty as quickly as possible in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 the center and we lower the lever with that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.430
 already recorded the machine 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.540
 Now we used to make some soap so that 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.480
 the remainder that remains is solid 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.130
 on the top of the plate the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.310
 we remove and open little plate 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.160
 and we give him water of soaps so that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.630
 cool the wax hour fast now 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.630
 we open the plates 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.010
 and we take out our sheet recorded by the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.010
 two sides 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.310
 when a vertical apparatus is sent 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.849
 silk is calibrated so that one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.010
 sheet of 100 grams the sheet as you see from 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.630
 is completely even and is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.170
 calibrated so that it leaves 100 grams 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.540
 but this machine has adjustment these 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.050
 four screws that have front the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.260
 machine are to adjust the thickness of 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.260
 the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.920
 if we want the sheet does not come out anymore 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.720
 thin let's go around the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 four screws to the left 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.180
 half a turn to the four screws 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.579
 at four 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.909
 if we want the sheet does not come out anymore 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.000
 and thinner if we want the sheet not 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.129
 come out thicker we give it a half 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.170
 turn right at four 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.170
 screws together with their nut counter 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.290
 if the wax were coming out 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.290
 bite down 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.709
 Also the picture has adjustment in 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.850
 is part of bottom we turn the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.020
 machine 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.640
 and these two hinges have a slide 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.120
 so if it were incomplete from this 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.000
 What we do is simply give 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.449
 a little blow to the hinge and what 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.229
 will do is open 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.509
 and if it comes from this side we give the 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:44.050
 view of a small tap and what 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:47.289
 going to do is open then that's how 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.360
 We calibrate this vertical apparatus to 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.979
 that comes out of the thickness but when 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.289
 we send a machine to be 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.770
 the sheet is calibrated so that it leaves 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.770
 definite 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.590
 three years ago we also launched the 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.620
 market the appliance a roller a 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.780
 wax marker for bees we are 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.850
 to serve you our data are 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.280
 our contact number will we 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.440
 get to the end of the future about the and of 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.009
 this video my name week high the atp 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.470
 and vargas thank you very much 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.540
 we appreciate the attention to our 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.770
 and a video 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.770
 and we are here to do
