00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.800 
that effective of a tool yet compared to
trailers<00:02:06.140> or<00:02:06.409> in<00:02:06.770> theaters<00:02:07.220> or<00:02:07.400> on<00:02:07.580> television

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
trailers or in theaters or on television

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.600 
trailers or in theaters or on television
but<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.869> will<00:02:09.140> say<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.530> social<00:02:09.950> networking<00:02:10.369> is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
but I will say that social networking is

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.820 
but I will say that social networking is
a<00:02:10.640> very<00:02:10.940> important<00:02:11.450> part<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.810> equation<00:02:12.050> as

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
a very important part of the equation as

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.560 
a very important part of the equation as
word-of-mouth<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.730> probably<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.420> most

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
word-of-mouth is probably the most

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.020 
word-of-mouth is probably the most
important<00:02:15.140> factor<00:02:15.290> when<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.430> going<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.850> see<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
important factor when I'm going to see a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.580 
important factor when I'm going to see a
movie<00:02:17.209> if<00:02:17.510> my<00:02:17.660> friend<00:02:17.990> says<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.500> an

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
I've not heard of it on me I'll make an

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.130 
I've not heard of it on me I'll make an
effort<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.360> question<00:02:23.720> which<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
effort to go a question which of the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.360

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
I would mix and match between those I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.820 
I would mix and match between those I
would<00:02:35.330> go<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.690> Pirates<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.440> and

would go with the Pirates and the and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.860 
would go with the Pirates and the and
the<00:02:37.010> dinosaurs<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.480> design<00:02:38.840> a
