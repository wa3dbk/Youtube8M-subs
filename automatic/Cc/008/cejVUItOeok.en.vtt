00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.610

 It was completely broken 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.790

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.620
 It's a former team-generation of the vortex 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:54.820
 It's not very memorable because I'm never seen me black spawn Gundam 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.300

 Crossbones I guess I forgot the number I bought before I bought it , but I forgot the number 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.069
 There is also Gundam mark 2 but everyone can do it already 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.140
 Mobile armor that is beam-coated with something like this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.180
