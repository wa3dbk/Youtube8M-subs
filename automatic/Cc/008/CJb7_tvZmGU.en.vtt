00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.110
 Welcome to Schwörer TV 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.430
 Today it's about the Schwörer Keller 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.560
 Production and assembly of swan houses 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.369
 have a perfectly built 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.820
 all-round protection 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.349
 of course, this includes a cellar 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.750
 House and cellar will be at Schwörerhaus 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.090
 planned and built as one unit 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.399
 Every cellar has different requirements 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.020
 Therefore, the construction and 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.180
 the heat insulation on the building plot 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.920
 the location and the type of use exactly 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.840
 matched the double turn for heavy 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.820
 Color consist of two payment cards 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.430
 concrete surfaces in the individual 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.830
 concrete shells are doors and windows 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.410
 recesses a bid further 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.509
 Would be electric according to customer requirements 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.000
 recesses and empty pipes as well 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.000
 really later electrical installation 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.610
 built in the precast concrete parts arise 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.759
 using state-of-the-art technology 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 production methods 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.049
 The plans are made in the company headquarters 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.150
 created in Hohenstein Oberstetten and 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.770
 together with the production data directly 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 transferred to the cellar works 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.390
 Industrial robots set there first 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.850
 the formwork reliable and high 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.829
 Measuring accuracy on production tables 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 become the cad data of the cellar 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.189
 Dimensions shown with laser technology 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.350
 After that, the probation becomes automatic 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 attached and the cellar wall concreted 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.070
 In a high performance furnace, the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.780
 concrete wall optimally dried 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 then the dried 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.020
 concrete bowl in the still wet concrete 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.900
 the associated second shell 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.850
 dipped and dried again so 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 a bivalve cellar wall is created 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.060
 if you use the cellar rooms as living area 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.650
 use and heat regularly then 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.960
 Let's start your cellar 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.960
 integrated thermal insulation from the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.850
 high quality 10 cm thick heat insulation 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.490
 is made according to a patented procedure 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.980
 it is located in the factory 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.690
 protected in the wall construction 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 between the concrete shells thereby 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440
 there are no thermal bridges 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.770
 continuity at the transitions 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.770
 guaranteed 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 with standing and pushing water 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.120
 we offer you a cellar 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.120
 special sealing system 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.930
 Schwörer cellars will be in the works 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 haigerloch-stetten rooms and far 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.310
 village industrially produced in the concrete plant 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.930
 in haigerloch stetten has the company 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.850
 Schwörerhaus even about one 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 factory quarry cellar assembly 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.470
 with our own cellar assembly 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 we build the cellar for you 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.550
 imaginations 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.190
 the prefabricated concrete walls will open 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.140
 a 15 cm thick with stripes 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.840
 foundations provided floor plate 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.480
 mounted then the referenced takes place 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.570
 with orbetbeton this creates a 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.810
 massive reinforced concrete exterior wall of 20 cm 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.630
 thick benefits of the Schwörer cellar 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.130
 Production house and cellar are called 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.410
 unit planned and built 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.780
 on request, you can also get the cellars 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.030
 in different stages of development we 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.130
 guarantee a timely 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.260
 construction progress with own it professionals 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.940
 get high quality through supervised 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.670
 Production from our certified 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.770
 the guarantee with five 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.430
 years after bgb you get for house 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.430
 and cellar together 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.860
 and next time it's on schwörer tv 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.860
 until then the insulated basement ceiling
