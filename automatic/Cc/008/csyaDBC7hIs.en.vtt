00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.640
 a bit boring 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.620

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.920
 play it 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.170
 also has a ranking also 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.790
 interesting it with the top 10 games 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.640
 best sellers and can check news 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.670

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.220
 concept art there is a film of del 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.200
 art he was different was here 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.880

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.600

 xbox 360 and xbox 360 controllers 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.810
 playstation 3 may be closer to the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.450
 that people imagine 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.400
 this is it personal the kotaku site he sat 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.290
 in contact with the programmers the galera 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.419
 as it is already making good progress in 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.490
 results are testing several games but 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.100
 Anyway, it's still good to roll. 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.660
 with fidelity the games on the pc will stay 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.390
 A little bit will take a little bit 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.150
 17 years 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.830
 - It is possible and who knows the time is now 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.320
 It 's strange that the regulator is 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.240
 champion bj promoter wants to know if the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.190
 engine is legal or illegal then it 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.470
 also notice that registration because 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.100
 has all the clarifications is for you 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.320
 beauty 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.180
 peter moore nou is the creator of the series 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.190
 fable ii time for cool games is 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.260
 interesting for the healing gifts and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.330
 he said indie games indexes 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.470
 with the days counted each one must 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.360
 have a lot 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.280
 I found to be honest the opinion team 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.440
 when he made a comparison with the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.420
 music that the bank was once great and 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.720
 now it does not exist anymore but more honestly 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.070
 I think I like the week goes 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.530
 to face a campaign and we talk 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.060
 but I thought this thing from Indian to 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.620
 little will not roll I think it will 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 continue what you think 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.970
 the news because basically this with me 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.680
 flu to the tire and we now go to our 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.210
 reader comments that guys volleyball 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.220
 the best comment of the last edition of 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.680
 check point there was not who sent the 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.450
 inepac and he said the following I walk 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.670
 realizing that the nation of fanboys who 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.050
 I admire a lot today may be 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.240
 because the games are just that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.030
 ignoring the Spaniards much better than 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.040
 discussing rationally or not with them is 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.940
 an evolution and I'm so happy 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.320
 thereby 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.000
 so let's learn to enjoy 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.980
 respect both sides 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.660
 competition is good without rivalry 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.820
 better still the existence of j 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.840
 I agree, I agree with you very much. 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.850
 very happy too with this comment 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.230
 get more reflective like that 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.480
 mainly on the chemical scenario is 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.280
 one thing that 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.530
 I admire so of course hope 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.660
 I liked jn today. 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.340
 video of the game itself if the 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.180
 song was pretty cool then check out the 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.740
 beauty 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.750
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.610
 never take a fee and then forget 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.980
 a channel to be part of the essence pj 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.200
 I'm already given 1 to play there on facebook 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.250
 of twitter is great for cut and 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.900
