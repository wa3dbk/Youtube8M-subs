 If there were imperfections it is recommended 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.240

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.120

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:21.030
 there were imperfections we chose the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 surface with 240 or 320 grit sandpaper 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.880
 we apply the last hand of palladium ara 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.130

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.520
 after 15 minutes the surface 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 It's dry enough to be able to 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.970
 polish and get the maximum shine being 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.250
 this possible manually with the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.010
 same level used previously or from 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:01.540
 mechanical way with thousand-grain leagues or 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:03.910
 4.000 can also be given wax for 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.450
