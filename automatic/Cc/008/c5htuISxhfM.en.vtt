00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.219
 Yes Hello Thank you for your viewing 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 I would like to talk about the virus com today 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.490
 Speaking of mobile phones Softbank au 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.990
 ntt DoCoMo has three major carriers 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 Softbank thinks about rate plan called white plan 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 We thought about a service that calls would be free for the same Softbank 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.590
 Thereby 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 au and ntt docomo oh 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.720
 We introduced such a service 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.680
 However, Willcom 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.070
 Selling the same thing 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.810
 Service that calls are free 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 Not introduced 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.530
 Flat-rate with anyone 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.080
 If the call charge to the landline car is less than 10 minutes 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.180
 0 Yen 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.900
 I thought of a plan that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.620
 And this is 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 You can make a call from your father on the moon 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.840
 This is my first 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.549
 It is one factor attracted to WILLCOM 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.490
 I was attracted by the attraction of selling one more 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.000
 U 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 Here 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.870
 this is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.030
 It is a regulation value of the transmission of the age of 3.11 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.090
 In this 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 Mobile communication so-called mobile phone 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.530
 Up to 70 parkers and 95 pars 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.480
 There was enforcement of regulation 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.460
 However, Willcom 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.460
 The regulation was not implemented 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.420
 Triggered by this 3.11 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.680
 It was easiest to connect at the time of disaster 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:15.600
 It came to be noticed again by the fact that it was telephone 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:17.300
 Because these two were personally attractive, I canceled and marketed the Softbank I used before 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 Moved to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.600
 The last kelp obtained from this 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:32.960
 If you are thinking of joining 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.960
 You may want to note that is how to choose a terminal 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.140
 I am this now 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.100
 I'm using a Willcom cell called Sokiasu 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.410
 8 hey now 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.000
 I'm not in the hand because I lost this phone, but certainly 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.000
 It was a maker of success 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.460
 This cell phone is very radio wave 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:08.710
 Just entering a little indoors will soon be out of range 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:14.550
 Only one antenna stands in spite of being at the station home 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.550
 Or is the antenna is often in a state that is not passed even one 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.310
 The radio wave is too bad 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.110
 I tried to inquire to market 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.530
 By manufacturer 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.710
 It seems clear that radio waves are good and bad 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.830
 Because 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.830
 Studio success that makes the number and-out this their 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.970
 Please do not select the mobile indicated with this sii 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.970
 Really bad radio waves 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.630
 It is surprising 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.480
 It is a cell phone of success . 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.930
 This is also true 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.880
 It was a success here. 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.260
 I think it better to stop this 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.630
 So bet that what is good 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.500
 This is Kyocera 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:21.220
 I do not have Kyocera, but I use it 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.450
 I think that slurs are good today because they talk to you that radio waves are good 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.270
 after 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:32.669
 This is recommended to personally 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.780
 The maker called net index this is used at the time of emergency 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.780
 I'm mobile but 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.260
 This is a very radio wave 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.680
 Although Koch et al radio now is standing almost all 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:51.050
 9 Manshon I'm very radio bad truth, however 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 Though not even a bad radio wave conditions 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 Now all radio waves are turned off like this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.710
 So this net index is highly recommended 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.070
 Kyocera rude It was a success I did not rectify 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.270
 Success is 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.430
 It is not connected at all if it is an apartment here 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.810
 So unavoidably 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:27.380
 I use to rent the antenna of Uyokomu 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:27.380
 However, this boiling water index is very good radio wave even if there is no antenna 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.740
 This is already 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:39.349
 Kana which the production 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.349
 The little now of the catalog 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.010
 Not because j 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.010
 It is very likely that production is over 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:58.250
 I saw whether there is another form of net index, but a little handling now 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.250
 I do not seem to be 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.990
 Very sorry you have of it so 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:08.010
 Sii What reason is there way of radio waves 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.010
 I have many things out 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.170
 I'm sorry many times I think that only one should quit sii 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.280
 So for the time being we will be in the second part 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.460
 I want to 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.840
 Something at Willcom 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:32.600
 I personally ask all means comment you have any questions 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.600
 Thank you for watching it today to here
