00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.270 
and this hand is all black because of
the<00:03:47.210> ink<00:03:47.420> you'd<00:03:48.170> sure<00:03:48.530> do<00:03:48.860> not<00:03:49.010> want<00:03:49.250> that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the ink you'd sure do not want that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.130 
the ink you'd sure do not want that
happen<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.060> optional<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:50.660> I'm<00:03:50.870> going<00:03:51.050> to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
happen this is optional but I'm going to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:01.500 
happen this is optional but I'm going to
mix<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:51.740> with<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> spoon

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:14.710 

you

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.210 

you

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.970 

that<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.360> helped<00:04:18.690> me<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:19.440> mix<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.860> all

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
that just helped me to mix it all

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.160 
that just helped me to mix it all
together<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.730> make<00:04:20.850> little<00:04:21.150> smaller<00:04:21.510> clumps

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
together to make little smaller clumps

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.010 
together to make little smaller clumps
like<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.340> there<00:04:24.150> might<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.300> some<00:04:24.570> extra

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
like this there might be some extra

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.710 
like this there might be some extra
strip<00:04:25.290> but<00:04:25.500> that's<00:04:25.680> definitely<00:04:25.890> okay<00:04:26.720> now

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
strip but that's definitely okay now

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:45.040 
strip but that's definitely okay now
we're<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.050> pour<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.440> into<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.770> strainer

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.040 

so<00:04:46.050> now<00:04:46.740> I'm<00:04:46.890> pressing<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.400> out<00:04:47.900> getting<00:04:48.900> all

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
so now I'm pressing it out getting all

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.320 
so now I'm pressing it out getting all
of<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.290> water<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.790> now<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:50.850> that's<00:04:51.180> done

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
of the water out now that that's done

00:04:51.330 --> 00:05:03.950 
of the water out now that that's done
you<00:04:51.960> want<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.170> pick<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.380> up<00:04:52.590> into<00:04:52.920> one<00:04:53.130> big<00:04:53.160> ball

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:29.700 

and<00:05:04.960> squeeze<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:28.170> make<00:05:29.170> sure<00:05:29.230> that<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.620> get

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and squeeze it make sure that you get

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.520 
and squeeze it make sure that you get
about<00:05:29.920> ninety<00:05:30.310> percent<00:05:30.430> of<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.850> water<00:05:31.060> out

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
about ninety percent of the water out

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.000 
about ninety percent of the water out
then<00:05:32.530> put<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:32.830> back<00:05:32.860> into<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.340> bowl<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:35.860> want
