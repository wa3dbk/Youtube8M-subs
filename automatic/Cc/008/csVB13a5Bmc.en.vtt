have<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.260> stability<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.310> them<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have to have stability you can them to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.959 
have to have stability you can them to
stabilize<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> syringe<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.170> well<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.130 
then the bottom you said yeah you have
to<00:00:35.579> come<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:35.880> behind<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.360> patient<00:00:36.780> you're

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to come from behind the patient you're

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
to come from behind the patient you're
not<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.590> able<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.510> how<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
not going to be able to how about the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.069 
not going to be able to how about the
other<00:00:40.020> side<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.620> those<00:00:40.770> two<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> top<00:00:41.930> okay

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
other side on those two on the top okay

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.330 
other side on those two on the top okay
turn<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:43.680> towards<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> say

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
turn all the way towards which you say

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.319 
turn all the way towards which you say
you<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> turn<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> patient<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> way

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you have to turn the patient all the way

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.670 
you have to turn the patient all the way
toward<00:00:45.539> unity<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.530> make

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
toward unity and that's going to make

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.840 
toward unity and that's going to make
all<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> difference<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.460> again<00:00:47.700> you're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
all the difference but again you're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:59.569 
all the difference but again you're
going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:56.899> make<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.430> depends<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
going to be make that depends on the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
going to be make that depends on the
long<00:00:59.760> axis<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> tooth<00:01:00.449> remember<00:01:01.020> you're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
long axis of the tooth remember you're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
long axis of the tooth remember you're
following<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> long<00:01:01.920> axis<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> tooth<00:01:04.280> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
following the long axis of the tooth so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:22.130 
following the long axis of the tooth so
right<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.729> yeah<00:01:20.720> if<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.840> doing<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
left side from the know where you want

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.450

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:08.930 

see<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.579> stable<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.119> makes<00:01:51.329> you<00:02:07.940> feel

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
see how stable that makes you feel

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.400 
see how stable that makes you feel
stable<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.569> yes<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.200> do

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
stable right yes I do

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.770 
stable right yes I do
what<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:12.090> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> way<00:02:12.420> toward<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
what if you get all the way toward the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.510 
what if you get all the way toward the
back

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
back

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.059 
back
as<00:02:15.520> long<00:02:15.640> as<00:02:15.760> you're<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.000> long<00:02:16.360> access

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.250 

seems<00:02:21.069> like<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> could<00:02:21.660> turn<00:02:22.660> towards<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
seems like you could turn towards you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:34.350 
seems like you could turn towards you
and<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:23.650> doing<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:31.860> no<00:02:32.860> yeah<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.180> use
