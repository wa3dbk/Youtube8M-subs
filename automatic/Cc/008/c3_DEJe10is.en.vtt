improvements number one a billet wheel

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
improvements number one a billet wheel
is<00:00:56.039> significantly<00:00:56.850> stronger<00:00:57.090> than<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> cast

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is significantly stronger than a cast

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.349 
is significantly stronger than a cast
aluminum<00:00:57.899> wheel<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:59.160> forged<00:00:59.760> billet<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
aluminum wheel and a forged billet is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.020 
aluminum wheel and a forged billet is
even<00:01:01.109> stronger<00:01:01.559> than<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> standard<00:01:02.460> 6000

series<00:01:03.290> billet<00:01:04.290> aluminum<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.070> we've<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
series billet aluminum so we've got the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
series billet aluminum so we've got the
absolute<00:01:06.720> strongest<00:01:07.049> possible<00:01:07.890> aluminum

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
absolute strongest possible aluminum

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.230 
absolute strongest possible aluminum
that<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.150> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that you can make out of these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
that you can make out of these
compressor<00:01:09.689> wheels<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.530> does<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.830> allow

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
compressor wheels and does that allow

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
compressor wheels and does that allow
for<00:01:11.100> different<00:01:11.610> types<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> machining<00:01:12.360> now

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for different types of machining now

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
for different types of machining now
what<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> does<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.220> allows<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
what it does is it allows the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
what it does is it allows the
compression<00:01:15.540> wheel<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> machined<00:01:16.409> much

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
compression wheel to be machined much

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
compression wheel to be machined much
differently<00:01:17.549> than<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.450> cast<00:01:18.720> compressor<00:01:19.500> wheel

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
differently than a cast compressor wheel

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679 
differently than a cast compressor wheel
you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> nose<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> hub

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you can make the nose and the hub

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.990 
you can make the nose and the hub
significantly<00:01:22.530> smaller<00:01:22.950> which<00:01:23.549> means<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
significantly smaller which means that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.910 
significantly smaller which means that
you've<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> greater<00:01:24.750> blade<00:01:25.229> width<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you've got a greater blade width and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
you've got a greater blade width and
it's<00:01:26.189> gonna<00:01:26.310> flow<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:26.909> air<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.150> equal<00:01:27.750> more

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it's gonna flow more air and equal more

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's gonna flow more air and equal more
horsepower<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.130> second<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.909> allows<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
horsepower then second it allows the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.760 
horsepower then second it allows the
wheel<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> thinner<00:01:33.119> blade

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
wheel to have a thinner blade

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
wheel to have a thinner blade
effectively<00:01:34.770> making<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.310> efficiency<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
effectively making the efficiency of the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
effectively making the efficiency of the
wheel<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.439> less<00:01:38.100> contact

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
wheel go up because it has less contact

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.219 
wheel go up because it has less contact
with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> air<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:38.939> less<00:01:39.240> heat<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> heat

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
with the air and less heat and heat

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
with the air and less heat and heat
obviously<00:01:40.439> Rob's<00:01:40.979> power<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> third

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
obviously Rob's power and then the third

the<00:01:57.060> turbocharger<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.530> basically<00:01:58.770> what

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the turbocharger so basically what

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.020 
the turbocharger so basically what
you're<00:01:59.070> saying<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.430> you've<00:01:59.579> got<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> lot<00:02:00.000> more

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you're saying is you've got a lot more

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
you're saying is you've got a lot more
blade<00:02:00.450> area<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> size<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> wheel

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
blade area for the size of the wheel

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.899 
blade area for the size of the wheel
that's<00:02:02.399> correct

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's correct

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.149 
that's correct
right<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.810> billet<00:02:04.200> wheel<00:02:04.409> will<00:02:04.680> always<00:02:04.950> have

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
right so a billet wheel will always have

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.639 
right so a billet wheel will always have
more<00:02:05.549> blade<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.509> flow<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:07.049> air<00:02:07.320> than

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
more blade it's gonna flow more air than

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.230 
more blade it's gonna flow more air than
the<00:02:07.770> cast<00:02:07.979> equivalent<00:02:08.700> well

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the cast equivalent well

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.060 
the cast equivalent well
so<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.630> are<00:02:09.900> limited<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> class<00:02:10.800> let's

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
so if you are limited to a class let's

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.130 
so if you are limited to a class let's
say<00:02:11.160> an<00:02:11.460> 88-millimeter<00:02:12.030> turbo<00:02:12.390> charger<00:02:12.960> for

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
say an 88-millimeter turbo charger for

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.740 
say an 88-millimeter turbo charger for
your<00:02:13.260> outlaw<00:02:13.650> racing<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.370> 88-millimeter<00:02:15.240> in

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
your outlaw racing and 88-millimeter in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.810 
your outlaw racing and 88-millimeter in
our<00:02:15.870> forged<00:02:16.260> billet<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:17.070> make<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.520> power

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
our forged billet will make more power

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.550 
our forged billet will make more power
because<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:18.540> more<00:02:18.570> blade<00:02:18.990> area

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because it's got more blade area

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
because it's got more blade area
what<00:02:19.950> other<00:02:20.070> unique<00:02:20.370> design<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> notice<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
what other unique design I notice is

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
what other unique design I notice is
that<00:02:21.150> you've<00:02:21.330> got<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> overlapping<00:02:22.260> wheel<00:02:22.950> as

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that you've got the overlapping wheel as

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.600 
that you've got the overlapping wheel as
well<00:02:23.220> yeah<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:25.230> strength<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> forged

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
well yeah it the strength of the forged

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
well yeah it the strength of the forged
billet<00:02:27.000> allows<00:02:27.330> us<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.840> machine<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> wheel<00:02:28.620> in

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
billet allows us to machine the wheel in

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.190 
billet allows us to machine the wheel in
ways<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.730> can't<00:02:30.120> make<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> cast

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
ways that you can't make it with a cast

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
ways that you can't make it with a cast
aluminum<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.550> gives<00:02:32.700> us<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.030> lot<00:02:33.300> of

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
aluminum so it gives us a lot of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.750 
aluminum so it gives us a lot of
flexibility<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.020> changing<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> shape<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
flexibility and changing the shape the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.530 
flexibility and changing the shape the
pitch<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.690> contour<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> blade<00:02:38.540> always

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
pitch the contour of the blade always

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
pitch the contour of the blade always
trying<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.870> increase<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.890> performance

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
trying to increase in the performance

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
trying to increase in the performance
and<00:02:41.520> efficiency<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> turbocharger<00:02:42.360> what

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and efficiency of the turbocharger what

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.300
