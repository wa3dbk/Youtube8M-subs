I'm going to use the left bracket key in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
I'm going to use the left bracket key in
order<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.840> let's<00:02:04.350> go<00:02:04.530> ahead<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> zoom

want to make sure that this is going to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.250 
want to make sure that this is going to
blend<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.519> really<00:02:41.580> nicely<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> other

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
off auto mask that's a on my keyboard

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.440

my<00:02:51.630> right<00:02:51.989> bracket<00:02:52.530> key<00:02:52.560> my<00:02:53.549> feather<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.150> at

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
my right bracket key my feather is at

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.319 
my right bracket key my feather is at
100<00:02:55.349> which<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.650> exactly<00:02:56.069> where<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> want<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.819> but

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
100 which is exactly where I want it but

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.270 
100 which is exactly where I want it but
I'm<00:02:57.420> actually<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.349> bring<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.799> float

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
I'm actually going to bring the float

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.180 
I'm actually going to bring the float
down<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.450> maybe<00:03:00.840> around<00:03:01.280> 40<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:03.510> way<00:03:04.160> when<00:03:05.160> I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
down to maybe around 40 that way when I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.259 
down to maybe around 40 that way when I
brush<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:07.040> softer<00:03:08.040> adjustment<00:03:08.670> later<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
brush it's a softer adjustment later and

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.449 
brush it's a softer adjustment later and
we<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.840> kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.410> brush<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.069> up<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> little

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
we can just kind of brush it up a little

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.670 
we can just kind of brush it up a little
bit<00:03:11.700> later<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.049> way<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.319> will<00:03:13.440> blend

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
bit later here so that way it will blend

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.619 
bit later here so that way it will blend
in<00:03:13.890> nicely<00:03:14.040> with<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.459> color<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.819> her<00:03:14.879> arm<00:03:15.090> okay

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
in nicely with the color of her arm okay

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.420 
in nicely with the color of her arm okay
now<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> have<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.260> great<00:03:16.560> selection<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
now that I have this great selection I

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.949 
now that I have this great selection I
can<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.790> press<00:03:17.940> o<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.209> turn<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.750> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
can just press o to turn off that

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.870

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
overlay and I'm gonna come over to my

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.180 
overlay and I'm gonna come over to my
sliders<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.480> start<00:03:21.780> experimenting<00:03:22.380> because

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
sliders and start experimenting because

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.550 
sliders and start experimenting because
I<00:03:23.220> know<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.760> her<00:03:24.030> hand<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.510> purple<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.200> could

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
I know that her hand is purple I could

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.220 
I know that her hand is purple I could
try<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:25.980> adjust<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.940> tint<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.450> pull<00:03:27.840> out<00:03:28.049> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
try to adjust the tint and pull out that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.589 
try to adjust the tint and pull out that
purple<00:03:28.620> by<00:03:28.769> adding<00:03:29.099> green<00:03:29.389> obviously<00:03:30.389> that's

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
purple by adding green obviously that's

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.390 
purple by adding green obviously that's
not<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.810> good<00:03:30.989> idea<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.560> could<00:03:32.040> pull<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.250> a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
not a good idea I could pull out a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.830 
not a good idea I could pull out a
little<00:03:32.609> bit<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.970> green<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.450> maybe<00:03:33.569> warm

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
little bit on the green and maybe warm

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.379

it up a little bit but if I look at the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.500 
it up a little bit but if I look at the
before<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:36.870> after<00:03:37.730> that's<00:03:38.730> still<00:03:39.030> not

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
before and after that's still not

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.839 
before and after that's still not

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
to zero quickly all you need to do is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.199 
to zero quickly all you need to do is
double<00:03:48.569> click<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:49.500> slider<00:03:50.220> indicator<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.120> it

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
double click the slider indicator and it

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.059 
double click the slider indicator and it
will<00:03:51.329> go<00:03:51.450> back<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.840> zero<00:03:52.049> we<00:03:52.470> could<00:03:52.769> choose

will go back to zero we could choose

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.039 
will go back to zero we could choose
saturation<00:03:53.910> we<00:03:54.180> could<00:03:54.389> try<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.599> desaturate

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
saturation we could try to desaturate

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.990 
saturation we could try to desaturate
that<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.530> little<00:03:55.829> bit<00:03:55.980> but<00:03:56.340> obviously<00:03:56.849> then

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
that a little bit but obviously then

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
that a little bit but obviously then
what<00:03:57.209> happens<00:03:57.599> is<00:03:57.780> when<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:57.959> take<00:03:58.230> out<00:03:58.410> color

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
what happens is when we take out color

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.460 
what happens is when we take out color
it<00:03:58.889> turns<00:03:59.160> gray<00:03:59.579> but<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.569> might<00:04:00.840> actually<00:04:01.109> be

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
it turns gray but that might actually be

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.930 
it turns gray but that might actually be
a<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.859> starting<00:04:02.250> point<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.700> I'm<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:02.910> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
a good starting point so I'm going to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300 
a good starting point so I'm going to
desaturate<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.319> little<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
desaturate just a little bit but the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.220 
desaturate just a little bit but the
problem<00:04:05.669> is<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.970> gray<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.630> what<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.810> need<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.079> do

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
problem is the gray so what I need to do

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.309 
problem is the gray so what I need to do
is<00:04:07.500> add<00:04:07.799> color<00:04:08.459> back<00:04:08.940> in<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.599> matches<00:04:10.049> her

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
is add color back in that matches her

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.259 
is add color back in that matches her
skin<00:04:10.349> tone<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.549> way<00:04:11.669> that<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:11.940> do<00:04:12.120> that

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
skin tone and the way that you do that

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.599 
skin tone and the way that you do that
is<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.840> click<00:04:13.079> on<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.440> color<00:04:13.650> box<00:04:13.919> with<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.459> X

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
is you click on the color box with the X

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.729 
is you click on the color box with the X
and<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.419> will<00:04:15.569> get<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.840> color<00:04:16.109> picker<00:04:16.470> and

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and you will get this color picker and

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.500 
and you will get this color picker and
you<00:04:16.859> could<00:04:17.190> move<00:04:17.370> your<00:04:17.430> mouse<00:04:17.760> inside<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.329> here

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
you could move your mouse inside of here

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.610 
you could move your mouse inside of here
and<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.840> obviously<00:04:19.169> see<00:04:19.440> what's

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
and you can obviously see what's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.349 
and you can obviously see what's
happening<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> trick<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.940> using<00:04:21.120> this

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
happening but the trick to using this

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.839 
happening but the trick to using this
tool<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.959> selecting<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.620> skin<00:04:23.219> tone<00:04:23.520> is

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
tool to selecting a skin tone is

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.870 
tool to selecting a skin tone is
clicking<00:04:24.750> inside<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.530> box<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.250> holding

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
clicking inside of this box and holding

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.410 
clicking inside of this box and holding
your

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
your

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.230 
your
miles<00:04:27.570> down<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.380> dragging<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.250> over<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:30.120> an

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
miles down and dragging it over to an

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360 
miles down and dragging it over to an
area<00:04:30.480> where<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.230> want<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.620> select<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.100> skin

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
area where you want to select the skin

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.800 
area where you want to select the skin
so<00:04:32.640> I'm<00:04:32.760> gonna<00:04:32.910> choose<00:04:33.150> right<00:04:33.390> about<00:04:33.600> there

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
so I'm gonna choose right about there

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.410 
so I'm gonna choose right about there
and<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:35.010> can<00:04:35.130> see<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.580> selected<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.120> nice

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
and you can see it selected this nice

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.850 
and you can see it selected this nice
peach<00:04:36.720> tone<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:37.350> it's<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.560> little<00:04:37.740> bit

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
peach tone but it's a little bit

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.130 
peach tone but it's a little bit
saturated<00:04:38.610> which<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.910> can<00:04:39.060> control<00:04:39.570> with

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
saturated which you can control with

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.350 
saturated which you can control with
this<00:04:40.500> slider<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:42.000> bring<00:04:42.180> that

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
this slider so I can bring that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.690 
this slider so I can bring that
saturation<00:04:42.930> down<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.710> little<00:04:44.130> bit<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.580> I'm

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
saturation down a little bit so I'm

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.150 
saturation down a little bit so I'm
adding<00:04:44.910> some<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.510> color<00:04:45.750> back<00:04:46.160> maybe

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
adding some of the color back maybe

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.550 
adding some of the color back maybe
around<00:04:47.370> 25%<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:48.420> can<00:04:48.660> close<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.080> dialog<00:04:49.530> box

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
around 25% I can close this dialog box

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.900 
around 25% I can close this dialog box
and<00:04:50.130> then<00:04:50.420> adjust<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.780> saturation<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
and then adjust the saturation on the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.670 
and then adjust the saturation on the
adjustment<00:04:54.420> brush<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.900> little<00:04:55.170> bit<00:04:55.320> further

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
adjustment brush a little bit further

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.760 
adjustment brush a little bit further
until<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.250> get<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.670> how<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.150> would<00:04:57.450> like<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.900> then

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
until I get it how I would like it then

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.770 
until I get it how I would like it then
I<00:04:58.980> could<00:04:59.040> press<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.610> backslash<00:05:00.150> key<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.660> look

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
I could press the backslash key to look

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.420 
I could press the backslash key to look
at<00:05:00.870> my<00:05:00.930> before<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.320> after<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.130> see<00:05:02.250> if<00:05:02.310> I'm

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
at my before and after and see if I'm

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.010 
at my before and after and see if I'm
going<00:05:02.610> in<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.880> good<00:05:03.060> direction<00:05:03.120> with<00:05:03.660> this<00:05:03.780> and

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
going in a good direction with this and

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.900 
going in a good direction with this and
I<00:05:04.080> actually<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:05.040> what<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.220> would<00:05:05.400> like<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.760> do

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
I actually think what I would like to do

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.760 
I actually think what I would like to do
is<00:05:06.150> increase<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.600> saturation<00:05:07.170> of<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.500> skin

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
is increase the saturation of that skin

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.230 
is increase the saturation of that skin
tone<00:05:07.980> so<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.370> pull<00:05:08.490> up<00:05:08.670> on<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:09.060> a

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
tone so I'm going to pull up on that a
