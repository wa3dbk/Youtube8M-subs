said because I don't like my hair

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.110 
said because I don't like my hair
feeling<00:02:28.910> hard<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:30.760> did<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> way<00:02:32.090> my

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
feeling hard I did like the way my

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.920 
feeling hard I did like the way my
twists<00:02:32.600> looked<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:34.040> again<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.209> had<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.570> add

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
twists looked but again I had to add

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.670 
twists looked but again I had to add
moisturizer<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.940> our<00:02:38.120> hair<00:02:38.390> twice<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.780> day<00:02:39.080> and

moisturizer to our hair twice a day and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.949 
moisturizer to our hair twice a day and
therefore<00:02:40.190> my<00:02:40.790> twist<00:02:41.209> started<00:02:41.600> getting<00:02:41.870> that

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
therefore my twist started getting that

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.150 
therefore my twist started getting that
frizzy<00:02:42.500> look<00:02:42.709> probably<00:02:43.459> by<00:02:43.730> day<00:02:44.410> three<00:02:45.410> it's
