00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
on the tenth or just real close up in

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.339 
on the tenth or just real close up in
there<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.109> one<00:00:24.320> has<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.529> Walker<00:00:25.400> liner<00:00:25.880> lock

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
there this one has the Walker liner lock

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.509 
there this one has the Walker liner lock
and<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.880> is<00:00:29.240> just<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.599> really<00:00:29.960> nice<00:00:30.380> knife<00:00:30.890> it's

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
and it is just a really nice knife it's

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.710 
and it is just a really nice knife it's
you<00:00:32.240> know<00:00:32.330> not<00:00:32.570> overly<00:00:33.110> heavy<00:00:34.690> really<00:00:35.690> a

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
smooth opening knife lining to lock

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.319 
smooth opening knife lining to lock
snaps<00:00:39.379> right<00:00:39.920> into<00:00:39.980> place<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.930> got<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:43.329> open

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329

snaps right into place it's got the open
back<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:46.610> spacers<00:00:47.390> are<00:00:47.629> grooved<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:50.410> the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
back the spacers are grooved and the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.150 
back the spacers are grooved and the
liner<00:00:51.739> itself<00:00:52.460> has<00:00:53.359> some<00:00:53.660> holes<00:00:53.949> drilled<00:00:54.949> out

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
liner itself has some holes drilled out

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.400 
liner itself has some holes drilled out
in<00:00:55.430> them<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.629> they're<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.199> little

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
in them so that they're a little

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.990 
in them so that they're a little
skeletonized<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.730> lighten<00:00:59.300> up<00:00:59.359> on<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> weight

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
skeletonized to lighten up on the weight

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.060 
skeletonized to lighten up on the weight
it's<00:01:02.000> got<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.600> black<00:01:03.760> anodized<00:01:05.800> clip2<00:01:06.800> blends

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's got a black anodized clip2 blends

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.660 
it's got a black anodized clip2 blends
in<00:01:07.340> with<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.630> carbon<00:01:08.630> fiber<00:01:08.900> handles<00:01:09.670> carbon

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
in with the carbon fiber handles carbon

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.760 
in with the carbon fiber handles carbon
fiber<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.210> textured<00:01:11.720> on<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.049> one<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:12.619> it's

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
fiber is textured on this one so it's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.580 
fiber is textured on this one so it's
not<00:01:12.950> smooth<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:14.570> some<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:15.020> them<00:01:15.140> are<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
not smooth like some of them are and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.370 
not smooth like some of them are and
there's<00:01:15.860> another<00:01:16.130> model<00:01:16.549> i<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:18.140> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
there's another model i have of a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.130 
there's another model i have of a
spyderco<00:01:18.799> sage<00:01:19.579> with<00:01:20.060> carbon<00:01:20.450> fiber<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.020> it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
spyderco sage with carbon fiber but it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.469 
spyderco sage with carbon fiber but it
has<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.659> frame<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.320> back<00:01:24.530> lock<00:01:24.799> on<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.479> this

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
has the frame the back lock on it this

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.960 
has the frame the back lock on it this
one<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> frame<00:01:27.229> lock<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.729> actually

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
one is the frame lock and it actually

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.429 
one is the frame lock and it actually
locks<00:01:29.420> really<00:01:29.960> well<00:01:30.759> now<00:01:31.759> spyderco<00:01:32.509> even

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
locks really well now spyderco even

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.870 
locks really well now spyderco even
tells<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.250> one<00:01:34.460> has<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> ramp<00:01:36.880> cut

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
tells you that this one has a ramp cut

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.420 
tells you that this one has a ramp cut
into<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.420> back<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.899> bleed<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.009> that<00:01:40.159> over

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
into the back of the bleed so that over

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.420 
into the back of the bleed so that over
time<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.840> liner<00:01:42.140> lock<00:01:42.380> will<00:01:42.680> adjust<00:01:43.070> itself

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
time the liner lock will adjust itself

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.520 
time the liner lock will adjust itself
with<00:01:44.090> usage<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.810> stay<00:01:45.229> very<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:46.340> know<00:01:46.369> secure

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.240 

as<00:01:51.530> jumping<00:01:52.250> on<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.810> top<00:01:54.049> thumb<00:01:54.710> ramp<00:01:55.009> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
as jumping on the top thumb ramp and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.649 
as jumping on the top thumb ramp and
jumping<00:01:56.240> on<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.719> Choi<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.700> bottom<00:01:59.090> soil

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
jumping on the Choi on the bottom soil

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.910 
jumping on the Choi on the bottom soil
and<00:02:00.219> so<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:02.270> does<00:02:02.539> provide<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> good<00:02:03.350> secure

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and so it does provide a good secure

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
and so it does provide a good secure
grip

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.520 

I<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.789> knife<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.440> be

if<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.989> had<00:02:25.200> any<00:02:25.380> criticism<00:02:26.160> at<00:02:26.310> all<00:02:26.459> on<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.700> knife

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
if I had any criticism at all on a knife

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.100 
if I had any criticism at all on a knife
it<00:02:27.780> would<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:29.480> pocket<00:02:30.480> clip<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it would be that the pocket clip is a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.259 
it would be that the pocket clip is a
little<00:02:31.530> wide<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.040> back<00:02:32.310> where<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.060> comes

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
little wide in the back where it comes

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.979 
little wide in the back where it comes
off<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.540> handle<00:02:34.519> but<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.540> makes<00:02:36.840> it

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
off the handle but you know it makes it

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.990 
off the handle but you know it makes it
easier<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.380> take<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.830> off<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.610> your

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
easier to take it off you know your

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240 
easier to take it off you know your
pants<00:02:39.360> it's<00:02:39.480> very<00:02:39.690> smooth<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.860> not<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
pants it's very smooth it's not going to
