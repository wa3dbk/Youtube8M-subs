gonna theme that thing remember Titan is
more<00:02:01.710> two-dimensional<00:02:02.490> Titan<00:02:03.450> has<00:02:03.899> crazy

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
more two-dimensional Titan has crazy

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490 
more two-dimensional Titan has crazy
amount<00:02:05.429> of<00:02:05.490> dimensions<00:02:06.140> everywhere<00:02:07.140> there's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
amount of dimensions everywhere there's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.999 
amount of dimensions everywhere there's
a<00:02:07.619> wall<00:02:08.450> still<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.599> floor<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> angle

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
a wall still in floor that's the angle

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.680 
a wall still in floor that's the angle
that<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.610> pawns<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.180> hitting<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that your pawns can be hitting or the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.460 
that your pawns can be hitting or the
back<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.989> your<00:02:13.080> hand

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
back of your hand

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.970 
back of your hand
so<00:02:14.040> fancy<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.580> walks<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.180> left<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so fancy just walks to my left this is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
so fancy just walks to my left this is
an<00:02:17.160> angle<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.489> here<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.850> hit<00:02:18.030> lost<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.200> my

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
an angle right here to hit lost of my

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.289 
an angle right here to hit lost of my
Rex<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:20.340> an<00:02:20.519> angle<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.239> me

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
Rex that's an angle right there for me

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.199 
Rex that's an angle right there for me
to<00:02:21.420> hit<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.780> know<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.769> come<00:02:23.370> down<00:02:23.400> my<00:02:23.940> palms

angle my hands my palms are up and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.850 
angle my hands my palms are up and
that's<00:02:28.080> an<00:02:28.200> angle<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:30.540> help<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.049> hit

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
that's an angle to help with that hit

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.410 
that's an angle to help with that hit
different<00:02:32.040> angle<00:02:32.430> two<00:02:32.519> different<00:02:32.850> times<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.390> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
different angle two different times so I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
different angle two different times so I
can<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.810> my<00:02:34.080> palm<00:02:34.799> facing<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.489> wall<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.760> my

of<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.890> go<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.720> was<00:03:47.220> pretty

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
of just go like that and I was pretty

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.780 
of just go like that and I was pretty
much<00:03:48.370> more<00:03:48.670> from<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:50.340> also<00:03:51.340> don't<00:03:51.670> be

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
much more from there also don't be

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.580 
much more from there also don't be
afraid<00:03:51.820> experiment<00:03:52.780> type<00:03:52.960> of<00:03:53.080> technically

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
afraid experiment type of technically

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.580 
afraid experiment type of technically
still<00:03:53.800> it's<00:03:54.790> fairly<00:03:55.090> new<00:03:55.240> well<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.110> don't<00:03:56.350> say

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
still it's fairly new well I don't say

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.740 
still it's fairly new well I don't say
no<00:03:56.800> that's<00:03:57.010> been<00:03:57.190> recreated<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:58.420> his<00:03:58.540> own

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
no that's been recreated to his own

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.930 
no that's been recreated to his own
style<00:03:59.050> so<00:03:59.500> you<00:04:00.040> don't<00:04:00.190> have<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.880> a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.640 
style so you don't have to be just a
mechanical<00:04:01.480> doing<00:04:01.810> your<00:04:01.930> test<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.380> just<00:04:02.440> a
