00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.210
 I'll show you guys like you guys 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.570
 easy or 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.679
 brawn knows just needs two 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.530
 sentences and a bit smart and 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.759
 of course a bit of acrylic is everything 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.970
 already done better with you 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.130
 clarify had two bottles on 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 I always have mine for you 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.610
 old reactor bottle to show off 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.990
 manufactured 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:31.070
 you look at short pieces of hose 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.050
 I say over in the filter was 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.899
 the longer piece of hose 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.219
 Downstairs , then, companies come in approximately 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:43.640
 so far in water on to the gas easy 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.460
 again from foreign bodies cleanings too 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.179
 Sun and then comes again clean a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.280
 hose up out who the gas into 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:56.659
 aquarium leads easily 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.859
 how does reactor liquid get three? 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.399
 I also show you how to learn it 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.139
 I do it myself half way 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.290
 Sometimes it can be so full 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:09.439
 Play it a little bit more like it should 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.850
 as I said above piece of hose to 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.659
 said Volker Huber 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.759
 maybe you can do that a bit 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.750
 see better from 3, the hose goes up 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.750
 really down 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.229
 it passes to extreme of 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.299
 hose from the big bottle is indeed 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.140
 until completely down and then comes 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.240
 Next hose up into the aquarium 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 not that the whole well-meaning pals 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
 to run 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.759
 no problem as I said 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.789
 I easily lost weight 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.159
 that speaks a little better long 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.009
 short sense two euros and then has everything 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270
 down 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.000
 now I think you can not say 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.849
 how did we tell you the reactor 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.259
 liquid itself makes up for in 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:13.019
 next video then a lot of fun 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.019
 first try until then
