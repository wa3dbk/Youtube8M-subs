let's have a look first thing there's a
battery<00:01:47.550> strap<00:01:49.610> let's<00:01:50.610> put<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.120> Box<00:01:51.450> away

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.750 

and<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:57.490> are<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:58.740> diffuses<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.980> light<00:02:00.310> if

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
and this are the diffuses the light if

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.390 
and this are the diffuses the light if
users<00:02:01.030> for<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.240> LEDs<00:02:01.660> some<00:02:02.470> small<00:02:02.980> standoffs

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.380 

the<00:02:08.390> LED<00:02:08.899> strips<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:10.190> two<00:02:10.430> different<00:02:10.880> colors

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
the LED strips in two different colors

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.360 
the LED strips in two different colors
some<00:02:12.380> more<00:02:13.100> standoffs<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.800> even<00:02:15.800> more

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
some more standoffs and even more

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.040 
some more standoffs and even more
standoffs

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.559 

let's<00:02:24.800> open<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> next<00:02:25.670> bag

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:42.390 

you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.150 

so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
so

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.980 
so
we<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.500> main<00:02:46.500> plate<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.720> it's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
we have the main plate you can see it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.450 
we have the main plate you can see it's
pretty<00:02:49.470> thin<00:02:50.480> how<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.780> mentioned<00:02:52.460> it

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
pretty thin how we can mentioned it

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.610 
pretty thin how we can mentioned it
would<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:54.060> 1.5<00:02:55.050> millimeter<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:57.620> really

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
would be 1.5 millimeter if this really

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.270 
would be 1.5 millimeter if this really
is<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.340> truth<00:02:59.790> we<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.690> see<00:03:01.080> later<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:02.220> this

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
is the truth we will see later in this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
is the truth we will see later in this
video<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:04.370> let's<00:03:05.370> put<00:03:05.820> these<00:03:06.240> things<00:03:07.020> side<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
video so let's put these things side a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.550 
video so let's put these things side a
bit<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:09.800> make<00:03:10.800> room<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.360> rest<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.110> this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
bit and make room for the rest so this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.910 
bit and make room for the rest so this
is<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> top<00:03:13.950> plate<00:03:14.780> basically<00:03:15.920> same

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
is the top plate basically same

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.250 
is the top plate basically same
thickness<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:19.850> yeah<00:03:20.850> there's<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.660> little<00:03:21.960> bag

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
thickness and yeah there's a little bag

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:34.430 
thickness and yeah there's a little bag
with<00:03:23.000> some<00:03:24.500> smaller<00:03:25.500> components<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:33.440> one

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
with some smaller components and one

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.390 
with some smaller components and one
with<00:03:35.010> some<00:03:35.670> bigger<00:03:36.000> components<00:03:37.220> open<00:03:38.220> this

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
with some bigger components open this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.750 
with some bigger components open this
one<00:03:38.550> up<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.060> first<00:03:42.660> thing<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:42.990> have<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.430> top

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
one up so first thing we have is the top

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:54.620 
one up so first thing we have is the top
plate<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.830> arms<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:53.630> downplayed

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
plate for the arms and the downplayed

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:05.670 
plate for the arms and the downplayed
for<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:56.070> battery

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.039

instructions included and many parts but
I<00:04:19.299> will<00:04:19.419> figure<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.810> out<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.289> make<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.590> video

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
I will figure it out and make a video

off as promised I took out my calipers
and<00:04:56.340> had<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.669> look<00:04:57.910> at<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.960> thickness<00:04:59.740> of<00:05:00.280> this

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
and had a look at the thickness of this

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:09.810 
and had a look at the thickness of this
sheets<00:05:02.039> so<00:05:03.039> it<00:05:03.699> was<00:05:05.280> 1.2<00:05:07.590> almost<00:05:08.590> everywhere<00:05:09.550> I

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
sheets so it was 1.2 almost everywhere I

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.930 
sheets so it was 1.2 almost everywhere I
measured<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:12.090> yes<00:05:13.090> that's<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.699> bit<00:05:15.699> less

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
measured it and yes that's a bit less

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.010 
measured it and yes that's a bit less
than<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.870> promised<00:05:17.289> 1.5<00:05:18.570> millimeter<00:05:19.570> that

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
than the promised 1.5 millimeter that

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.990 
than the promised 1.5 millimeter that
they<00:05:20.229> mentioned<00:05:20.740> in<00:05:20.919> their<00:05:21.159> product<00:05:22.120> video<00:05:24.000> we

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
they mentioned in their product video we

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.050 
they mentioned in their product video we
will<00:05:25.120> see<00:05:27.000> if<00:05:28.000> it's<00:05:28.240> still<00:05:28.780> stable<00:05:29.260> enough<00:05:30.060> but

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
will see if it's still stable enough but

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.820 
will see if it's still stable enough but
a<00:05:31.360> bit<00:05:32.289> thicker<00:05:32.889> than<00:05:33.780> 1.5<00:05:34.780> would<00:05:35.110> have<00:05:35.530> been

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
a bit thicker than 1.5 would have been

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.540 
a bit thicker than 1.5 would have been
nice<00:05:36.039> and<00:05:36.340> 1.2<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.090> definitely<00:05:37.630> less<00:05:38.349> than<00:05:39.419> 1.5

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
nice and 1.2 is definitely less than 1.5

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.740 
nice and 1.2 is definitely less than 1.5
yeah<00:05:43.020> we<00:05:44.020> will<00:05:44.169> see<00:05:45.210> thank<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.300> for<00:05:46.419> watching
