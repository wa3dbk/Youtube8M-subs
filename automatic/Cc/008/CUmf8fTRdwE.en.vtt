them<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.010> usually<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
them all on and I what I usually do is a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.050 
them all on and I what I usually do is a
24<00:01:57.810> hour<00:01:57.930> cycle<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> trade<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.640> morning

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
24 hour cycle so I trade in the morning

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
24 hour cycle so I trade in the morning
and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:00.690> list<00:02:01.080> all<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.260> players<00:02:01.500> up

continually<00:02:02.430> relist<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.780> list

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
continually relist them and then list

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.750 
continually relist them and then list
them<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.260> overnight<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.400> sell

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
them up overnight and they all sell

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.340 
them up overnight and they all sell
overnight<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.870> know<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> market

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
overnight because you know the market

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
overnight because you know the market
goes<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.680> bit<00:02:07.830> quieter<00:02:08.280> there's<00:02:08.459> less<00:02:08.640> cards<00:02:08.940> on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
goes a bit quieter there's less cards on

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300 
goes a bit quieter there's less cards on
the<00:02:09.119> market<00:02:09.149> less<00:02:09.569> competition<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.310> more

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the market less competition and more

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
the market less competition and more
likely<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.730> people<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.330> buy<00:02:12.569> them<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.349> that's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
likely for people to buy them so that's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.289 
likely for people to buy them so that's
how<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.890> works<00:02:14.129> anyway<00:02:14.790> what<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> didn't

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
how it works anyway what I didn't

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.209 
how it works anyway what I didn't
mention<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.659> I<00:02:15.689> actually<00:02:15.930> got<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.290> apparel<00:02:16.769> in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that he has sold on for 3500 is kind of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.550 
that he has sold on for 3500 is kind of
topical<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:24.930> pick<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.409> whole

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400 
training technique as last time what
we've<00:03:03.120> done<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:03.569> just<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.900> advance<00:03:04.019> time

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
we've done is with just the advance time

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.990 
we've done is with just the advance time
and<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.920> spent<00:03:05.190> all<00:03:05.310> our<00:03:05.370> coins<00:03:05.760> on

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and we have spent all our coins on

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
and we have spent all our coins on
players<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.739> list<00:03:07.920> them<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.099> up

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
players and then I can list them all up

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.830 
players and then I can list them all up
I<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.459> like<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.269> lift<00:03:09.450> them<00:03:09.629> up<00:03:09.690> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
I don't like to like lift them up in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.569 
I don't like to like lift them up in
drips<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.170> drabs<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.650> would<00:03:11.160> do<00:03:11.310> otherwise

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
drips and drabs I would do otherwise

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.280 
drips and drabs I would do otherwise
because<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.569> lot<00:03:12.690> easier<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.079> I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
because it's a lot easier because I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.690 
because it's a lot easier because I
don't<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.739> write<00:03:13.920> down<00:03:14.099> what<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> need<00:03:14.579> to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
don't have to write down what I need to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.000 
don't have to write down what I need to
put<00:03:14.849> them<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.560> reason<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:16.950> do

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
put them up for but and the reason I do

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470
