00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 besides the small defects and this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.389
 Defect does not have on youtube in any 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:15.920
 another place I found this here is the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.920
 150 horsepower a3 ignition module 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 he presented in order to be done and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.750
 cut the third ignition coil 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.230
 you know the Audi A3 has the be the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:42.180
 beginning with 1234 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 this ignition module for some time 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 he bothered 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.090
 he cut no more and no less the third 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.000
 then did not send the signal to the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.699
 third beautiful but how this engine is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 very strong and will feel but on average 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.510
 high also works normal almost runs out 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.930
 blocking the action of the nozzle match and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.680
 works only with three pistons 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 but the engine loses a lot of force and he 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:31.520
 citizen here I get him he goes arrested 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.070
 in the filter box that it takes 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 chilled and that brazil more 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.250
 read more autonomy and a current very 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 high and warm and civic epidemic 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.910
 there it is purposely placed in the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.910
 dispute 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.210
 it is the mode of intermediate induction in 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 3 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 the injection module that is behind here 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:10.869
 he did not have the strength to climb a 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.970
 ramp picked up very chic it accelerated 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.570
 too much clutch 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.970
 Then he can win I believe 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:26.610
 change the original part not 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:31.200
 I found the original thing there is the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:37.209
 generic I will immediately take 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.160
 this is another defect of a3 that is in 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:55.510
 some cases it may appear that dell com 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:56.680
 the problem of bina cables are rock and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:06.000
 started working again 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:06.000
 the ignition module of a3 150 hp
