00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.490
 Hi everyone, I decided that I want to be 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.090
 showing how to make a 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.460
 reservoir that in case if you just 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.240
 damaging neo in transport one thing 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.310
 happened right? 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.420
 ended up breaking this club here from 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.269
 reservoir 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.039
 here I'm going to break it, right? 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.869
 O I'm doing the effect here O club 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.780
 so what is done there that sometimes is 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.550
 with ink and nÃ© is a reservoir will have 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.760
 All this handling that I 'm doing, right? 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:53.470
 but the procedure is the same as that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:55.900
 Looks like we're going to have it there and here just to do it 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.090
 a hole depending on the reservoir 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.710
 but you will not be able to work 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.960
 here only take the base but the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 procedure here and teeth will make a 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 hole here as such 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 it's so functional did the fury go 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.130
 need the parts here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.420
 this is a sealing ring is so 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.930
 which has a hole in the middle 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.520
 that 's the beak le also have the cap 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.799
 that has a little hole in the middle you can 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.710
 be used in place here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 O you get here cuts had a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 bit with that hole it turned into a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.019
 ring only that it turned a ring 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.880
 sealing 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.750
 the future gets smaller so give more 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.720
 pressure used this one again. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.319
 I used a 3mm drill bit in the center 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.319
 two here he is 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.879
 A bit boring to put on but I do not 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.590
 I will neither edit this video and show that 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:56.110
 It is complicated a bit but 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:03:02.599
 solution is very good and will put in 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:06.140
 check out what jack london zinho got 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.200
 the little piece got a dirt in there 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 No problem, it's not going to damage anything. 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.180
 and only had if you have how to take and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.310
 beauty, otherwise it's okay 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.950
 problem is not here and now on the part of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 hose if it checks as it is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 she stays with a little is extended here already 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.200
 is so already picked up the format will remove 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.200
 this little bit here 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.190
 now it's going to take place miguel pupo 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:44.870
 neighbor 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:48.019
 I received with it fought until the end to 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:53.120
 can give enough pressure and can 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.889
 to fit in again here happens 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.349
 like I was here before 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.260
 Only now he has only changed his place. 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.910
 cnel did not leave the front came down 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.790
 and it stayed right the same thing 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.609
 now they represent if they did the repair 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.970
 right will get to work you also 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:20.570
 could be using sakineh for 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:23.349
 example only going to be a little bit 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.349
 rate of things right 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.229
 I made with that sealing ring and if 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.370
 cap it 's colorful ne 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:50.610
 the magento but has several colors right 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.110
 you do not have differences in color may be 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.120
 using the transparent same I got 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.930
 In the pink kitchen you can see the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.930
 procedure 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.300
 inside there 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.799
 There my dog is inside and here it is. 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.749
 right 

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:41.189
 I took a start right here because if 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:45.499
 also a little more difficult to place 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.499
 but there it is at your discretion, right? 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:52.529
 This will put him in a little bit. 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:54.959
 more film to fit but also has the 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.059
 solution, then you can almost 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:59.429
 to see a little better 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:02.159
 that's how it works so you're going to need it 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:05.519
 that the cap put 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.769
 the ring and the nozzle is to see this 

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.719
 Guys I hope to help because everyone 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.639
 able to do the procedure and any 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:17.149
 doubt contact us our
