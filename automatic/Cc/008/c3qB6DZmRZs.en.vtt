00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
happen is you need your never it is to

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.890 
happen is you need your never it is to
basically<00:06:17.640> be<00:06:17.850> destroyed<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.600> that's<00:06:18.780> not

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
too hard the cards only 18 so they

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.980 
too hard the cards only 18 so they
destroy<00:06:20.729> it<00:06:20.880> it<00:06:21.090> goes<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.419> graveyard<00:06:21.870> and

normal summon since those were all
special<00:06:43.560> summons<00:06:43.860> you<00:06:43.949> then<00:06:44.070> just<00:06:44.100> normal

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
special summons you then just normal

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
level modulation manipulation with that

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.270 
level modulation manipulation with that
and<00:06:51.320> these<00:06:52.320> two<00:06:53.810> so<00:06:54.810> now<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.020> have<00:06:55.350> two<00:06:55.979> fours

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
and these two so now you have two fours

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.010 
and these two so now you have two fours
and<00:06:56.520> two<00:06:56.550> fives<00:06:56.970> and<00:06:57.449> you<00:06:57.690> would<00:06:57.780> bring<00:06:57.870> out

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
and two fives and you would bring out

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.629 
and two fives and you would bring out
your<00:06:58.290> your<00:06:59.250> kayak<00:07:00.290> over<00:07:01.290> here<00:07:01.830> and<00:07:02.010> you<00:07:02.550> would

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
your your kayak over here and you would

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.090 
your your kayak over here and you would
bring<00:07:02.880> out<00:07:03.030> watching<00:07:03.840> back<00:07:03.990> here<00:07:04.320> so

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
bring out watching back here so

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.170 
bring out watching back here so
basically<00:07:05.370> that's<00:07:05.550> what<00:07:05.669> your<00:07:05.880> field<00:07:06.090> is

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
basically that's what your field is

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.490 
basically that's what your field is
looking<00:07:06.419> like<00:07:06.600> and<00:07:06.870> then<00:07:07.050> you<00:07:07.139> just<00:07:07.320> use

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
looking like and then you just use

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500 
looking like and then you just use
Hayek's<00:07:07.889> effect<00:07:08.250> if<00:07:08.880> they<00:07:09.000> have<00:07:09.120> a<00:07:09.150> monster

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
like it has to be like 1800 or more you

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.210 
like it has to be like 1800 or more you
just<00:07:11.970> attach<00:07:12.330> this<00:07:12.570> you<00:07:12.750> make<00:07:12.900> it<00:07:13.020> 0<00:07:13.350> you<00:07:13.979> use

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
just attach this you make it 0 you use

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.629 
just attach this you make it 0 you use
Machu<00:07:14.820> mechs<00:07:15.120> effect<00:07:15.449> like<00:07:15.630> you<00:07:15.780> detach<00:07:16.110> and

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
Machu mechs effect like you detach and

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.480 
Machu mechs effect like you detach and
then<00:07:17.639> by<00:07:17.760> doing<00:07:18.000> that<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:19.080> inflict<00:07:19.500> 1800

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
then by doing that you inflict 1800

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.529 
then by doing that you inflict 1800
damage<00:07:20.729> to<00:07:20.880> them<00:07:21.000> so<00:07:21.120> they've<00:07:21.240> already<00:07:21.360> taken

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
damage to them so they've already taken

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.870 
damage to them so they've already taken
1800<00:07:22.229> and<00:07:22.530> now<00:07:22.740> Machu<00:07:22.979> mech<00:07:23.220> is<00:07:23.340> going<00:07:23.520> to<00:07:23.610> gain

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
1800 and now Machu mech is going to gain

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.250 
1800 and now Machu mech is going to gain
eighteen<00:07:24.330> hundreds<00:07:24.690> and<00:07:24.840> now<00:07:24.960> it's<00:07:25.080> going<00:07:25.169> to

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
eighteen hundreds and now it's going to

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.159 
eighteen hundreds and now it's going to
be<00:07:25.350> at<00:07:25.440> 4,200<00:07:25.889> and<00:07:26.400> there's<00:07:26.820> gonna<00:07:26.910> be<00:07:27.030> at

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:27.169 
be at 4,200 and there's gonna be at

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.100 
be at 4,200 and there's gonna be at
2,000<00:07:28.169> so<00:07:28.770> basically<00:07:29.610> you<00:07:29.760> just<00:07:29.930> use<00:07:30.930> its

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.110 
2,000 so basically you just use its

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.860 
2,000 so basically you just use its
effect<00:07:31.199> to<00:07:31.650> destroy<00:07:32.100> a<00:07:32.130> monster<00:07:32.370> whose<00:07:32.870> who

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
effect to destroy a monster whose who

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.110 
effect to destroy a monster whose who
has<00:07:34.169> a<00:07:34.199> difference<00:07:34.650> in<00:07:34.770> its<00:07:34.919> original<00:07:35.120> and

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
has a difference in its original and

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.110 
has a difference in its original and
it's<00:07:36.750> as<00:07:36.900> it's<00:07:37.110> now<00:07:37.289> set<00:07:37.590> attack<00:07:37.860> so<00:07:38.669> basically

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 
it's as it's now set attack so basically

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.940 
it's as it's now set attack so basically
you<00:07:39.270> just<00:07:39.300> destroy<00:07:40.289> it<00:07:40.470> and<00:07:40.590> then<00:07:40.710> the<00:07:40.770> field

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950 
you just destroy it and then the field

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.690 
you just destroy it and then the field
is<00:07:41.070> clear<00:07:41.370> and<00:07:41.580> then<00:07:42.000> you've<00:07:42.180> already<00:07:42.389> dealt

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.700 
is clear and then you've already dealt

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.400 
is clear and then you've already dealt
1800<00:07:44.700> mu<00:07:44.910> deal<00:07:45.090> 2,000<00:07:45.690> more<00:07:45.840> that<00:07:46.020> brings<00:07:46.229> them

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 
1800 mu deal 2,000 more that brings them

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.770 
1800 mu deal 2,000 more that brings them
that<00:07:47.099> deals<00:07:47.250> 3800<00:07:47.970> damage<00:07:48.270> and<00:07:48.479> then<00:07:48.570> you<00:07:48.660> do

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 
that deals 3800 damage and then you do

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.080 
that deals 3800 damage and then you do
