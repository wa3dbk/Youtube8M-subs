00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.949
 one of my favorite videos is this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 three tales gustavo der published in 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 1877 and en3 tales as the title says was 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 the day of anagé de são joão hospitaleiro 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 and a simple heart that is my story 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 favorite of a woman 's story 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.559
 humble and your maid who works 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.460
 for half a century for a female 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.460
 french province 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.740
 he is fundamental in mine in my life 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.710
 of voter and first voter after 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.110
 That's why I read it when I was 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 young man and it was a discovery for me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 because this character is a character 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.780
 will say that I met in Manaus in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 years later indications of this character I 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.360
 I could see in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.970
 of manaus that haunted me 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.979
 it was a fact that the gil realized parallels 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.460
 is in the life suffered of a character of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.470
 fiction and people I knew in the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 my house and the neighborhood 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.880
 I was inspired by the fact that this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.270
 poor woman is the maid of the tale of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.030
 simple heart to build a 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.679
 character is from my most 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.610
 known with two brothers then to 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.610
 on Sundays that this Indian 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.230
 Cabocla is explored in a house in Manaus 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.640
 she was inspired that she was 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.299
 reading let's first see is from a 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.299
 simple heart 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.660
 very precise language sometimes 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.530
 ellipse in some sentences 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.770
 this is very calculated very reflected 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.800
 do not read the few descriptions of the book 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:54.200
 to say only one sentence and suggests is 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.850
 whole scenario and I think that was 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.470
 me a lesson is to try is to synthesize 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.440
 to try to conciseness is to thicken and myself 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.700
 at the same time accentuated the conflicts and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.700
 the human dramas 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.530
 What a great book. 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.060
 first I think it's a book that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.970
 you find a job with the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.680
 language is what gives consistency to 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.740
 literature to language 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 only to be well written not enough he has 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.220
 that besides then I think the book 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.300
 which transmits to the reader one 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.810
 complexity of the invented world 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:57.740
 I think of human relationships is that that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.990
 through narrative is this is a let's 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.990
 see flame a great book
