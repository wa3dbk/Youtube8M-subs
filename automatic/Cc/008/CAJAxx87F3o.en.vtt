00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.440 
eight-year gap
I<00:00:38.710> guess<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.130> raving<00:00:39.430> rabbids<00:00:39.790> machine<00:00:40.120> just

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
I guess the raving rabbids machine just

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.389 
I guess the raving rabbids machine just
stopped<00:00:40.720> raining<00:00:41.020> money<00:00:41.350> for<00:00:41.680> some<00:00:41.859> reason<00:00:42.280> I

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
stopped raining money for some reason I

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.889 
stopped raining money for some reason I
find<00:00:42.609> it<00:00:42.760> interesting<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.239> they<00:00:43.449> decided<00:00:43.780> to

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
find it interesting that they decided to

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.139 
find it interesting that they decided to
go<00:00:44.050> back<00:00:44.289> to<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.500> 2d<00:00:44.920> platformer<00:00:45.579> but<00:00:45.879> I<00:00:45.910> guess

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
go back to a 2d platformer but I guess

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.970 
go back to a 2d platformer but I guess
with<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.390> success<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.960> Super<00:00:47.289> Mario<00:00:47.530> Brothers

with the success of Super Mario Brothers

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.799 
with the success of Super Mario Brothers
we<00:00:48.190> they<00:00:48.670> thought<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.030> would<00:00:49.090> be<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.269> good<00:00:49.480> idea

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
we they thought it would be a good idea

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.080 
we they thought it would be a good idea

I<00:04:15.670> would<00:04:15.970> imagine<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:17.019> as<00:04:17.140> good

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
I would imagine that it's just as good

I would imagine that it's just as good
as<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> rest<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.950> game<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.729> that's<00:04:18.910> all

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
as the rest of the game but that's all

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.180 
as the rest of the game but that's all
that<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:19.390> assume<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.410> back<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.859> levels

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
that I can assume but back to the levels

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.010 
that I can assume but back to the levels
there's<00:04:21.640> about<00:04:21.850> sixty<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.479> them<00:04:22.570> at<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> back

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
there's about sixty of them at the back

there's about sixty of them at the back
of<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.229> boxes<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.740> believe<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.640> don't

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
of the boxes to believe and I don't

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.820 
of the boxes to believe and I don't
doubt<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.120> either<00:04:25.450> even<00:04:26.229> though<00:04:26.260> there's<00:04:26.530> tons

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
doubt it either even though there's tons

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070 
doubt it either even though there's tons
of<00:04:26.950> levels<00:04:27.130> there's<00:04:27.729> really<00:04:28.150> no<00:04:28.510> content

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.810 
I must address the other complaint that
I<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.290> with<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.530> game<00:04:53.770> although<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.700> is<00:04:54.790> a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
I have with this game although it is a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.790 
I have with this game although it is a
moot<00:04:55.090> point<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.870> weigh<00:04:56.080> heavily<00:04:56.350> on<00:04:56.650> my

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
moot point it can weigh heavily on my

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.770 
moot point it can weigh heavily on my
decision<00:04:57.130> for<00:04:57.460> recommending<00:04:57.940> this<00:04:58.060> game<00:04:58.330> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
decision for recommending this game and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.990 
decision for recommending this game and
that<00:04:59.200> factor<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.710> how<00:04:59.860> much<00:05:00.100> does<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.370> game<00:05:00.640> cost

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
that factor is how much does a game cost

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.810 
that factor is how much does a game cost
is<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.840> worth<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.020> price<00:05:02.170> of<00:05:02.530> admission<00:05:02.820> when

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
is it worth the price of admission when

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.120 
is it worth the price of admission when
Rayman<00:05:04.180> Origins<00:05:04.210> was<00:05:04.720> released<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.290> was<00:05:05.350> $60

then<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.940> dropped<00:05:07.240> dramatically<00:05:07.990> over<00:05:08.380> time

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
then it dropped dramatically over time

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.880 
then it dropped dramatically over time
