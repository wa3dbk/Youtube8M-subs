00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.450
 in 1986 the united states arrive a graphic 9 that would have revolutionized 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.579
 what until then had been the way of understanding superheroes 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.309
 not only of the dc comics universe but also of the marvel one a work in degree 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.530
 to transcend the comics to establish itself as a real literary case by winning 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.950
 even the hugo prize 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.700
 watchmen 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.700
 mora gibson's masterpiece is a work that shows the various masked vigilantes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.100
 on the same level as ordinary citizens with fear and hope and emotions not 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 spotless hero but ordinary human beings coming down the streets for a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.690
 innate sense of justice sometimes even distorted 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.140
 last year finally came a film adaptation of the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.990
 comics 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.250
 so ambitious 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 be neither neighbors loved by everyone 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.980
 however of nani case worner bross has decided to bet a lot on the ip 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.340
 so much so as to have started a series of video games distributed via digital 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.440
 delivery should narrator stories of roger the night aulla before the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.580
 dissolution of deeds to patrini 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 after the first clumsy deadline attempt if you try again with watching 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.260
 ndp and snai 2 second episode downloadable available for pc and ps3 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.680
 and at the end of the month also arriving on xbox 3 60 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.960
 hoping that this time I can deliver a better finished product 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 that turns out to be more varied than fun 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.479
 like every good watch and Ian of snai 2 it slavishly takes over 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.200
 mechanics of the first episode 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.750
 we will therefore have to accompany night rock classrooms for the violent 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.840
 city ​​streets 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.750
 in order to discover that lies behind the making of erotic films with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.669
 protagonist of my martinis 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.150
 vigilantes won't go much for the subtle 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.349
 in fact, he will long prefer to use his hands rather than the myth of 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.879
 triple class c investigation 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.319
 the game will therefore be beat em up lasting three chapters from the mechanics 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.069
 rather classic 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.739
 the whole series of rooms crammed with nim pc will follow one another incessantly 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.659
 which will slowly return to the end of the level 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.970
 unlike the classical scheme of the genre 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.250
 at the end of each level we won't have any woods you saved the boss 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.689
 the final 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.709
 apart from some simple levada press leaning to find during about 3 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.089
 hours needed to complete the game with one character we will have to do more 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.479
 than to run one's hands thankfully that they use the found a certain 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.170
 massacre the various certain disseminated by absolute level of cicerale 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.420
 that makes you share in the madness and anger that invade the mind of this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.129
 enigmatic character 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.060
 unfortunately for him night aura does not have the same charisma and use it 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.579
 it could be a bit more cumbersome, it is definitely less fun 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.189
 the striking keys 1 for counterattack tricks are your only move 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.339
 arrangement but following the indications that will appear screen you could give the 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 via lethal spectacular executions 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.269
 in this way the timing is much more important than the low me down 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.930
 aparine in certain phases more gay laugh I put a running fighting game 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.869
 but as we said, we do nothing but beat and the joy of fun 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.329
 who are in the early game price moments will vanish due to the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.009
 insistently repeating the same scenario 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.009
 the adversaries and even the same violent final sequences 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.150
 from this point of view the rather narrow longevity might seem 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.409
 almost a strength 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.989
 since going through the final stages will be rather boring done away 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.869
 enemies entering the final room enemy 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.449
 the same hope that the conclusion is finally reached 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.769
 it becomes a palpable sensation 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.589
 technically speaking watch and i end is nigh 2 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.829
 it is noted for a general improvement in the graphics sector compared 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.199
 in the first episode 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.829
 lately characterized several protagonists who benefit from used in 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.099
 nations and those of excellent workmanship are less convincing than routines 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.150
 they manage the interpenetration of bodies 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.230
 and the lack of vertical synchrony 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.680
 problem that could not be completely eliminated 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.430
 not even pushing the settings of an ati hd 4890 to the maximum 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.939
 the sound sector is appreciated for an excellent dubbing by the actors 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.250
 film originals 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.840
 and some good sound effects 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.470
 longevity is certainly the weak point of world production together 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.400
 to the variety since in an afternoon of intense play it will be possible 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.569
 complete the campaign using both characters 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.229
 two local players mode will serve little to keep up 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 the attention around this second episode 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.900
 watch indian visa the two is a recommended title those few who loved 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.070
 to madness the first episode of the Siberia for those who are in crisis 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.250
 of abstinence for the waiting longer than expected of the goraj containing the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.279
 extended version of the motion picture film 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.269
 all others will have to evaluate well if they have no better way to 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.460
 spend 13 euros needed to purchase 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.430
 not so much because this is a bad game 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.099
 but because it offers nothing more than an afternoon of intense and fistfight
