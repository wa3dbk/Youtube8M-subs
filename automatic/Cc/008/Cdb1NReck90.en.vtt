00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
alright guys here I am out of my flying

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.589 
alright guys here I am out of my flying
field<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:06.839> an<00:00:06.960> fpv<00:00:07.529> 40<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:09.150> put<00:00:09.389> this

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
field with an fpv 40 and I put this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.459 
field with an fpv 40 and I put this
orange<00:00:10.230> rx<00:00:10.800> stabilization<00:00:11.759> unit<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:13.080> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
orange rx stabilization unit here on it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.930 
orange rx stabilization unit here on it
because<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.740> thing<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.280> version<00:00:14.580> 2<00:00:14.730> can

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
because this thing the version 2 can

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120 
because this thing the version 2 can
handle<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.299> delta<00:00:15.750> wing<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.890> set

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
handle a delta wing so I have this set

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
handle a delta wing so I have this set
up<00:00:17.250> currently<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:18.240> stabilize<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.840> wing<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
up currently to stabilize this wing and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.929 
up currently to stabilize this wing and
what<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> did<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.859> put<00:00:20.010> my<00:00:20.130> GoPro<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.699> front

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
what I did is I put my GoPro up front

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.509 
what I did is I put my GoPro up front
here<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.539> made<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> sexual<00:00:22.529> foam<00:00:23.310> board

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
here I just made the sexual foam board

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
here I just made the sexual foam board
case<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.119> saves<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.570> 90<00:00:25.019> grams<00:00:25.289> anyway

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
case for it saves about 90 grams anyway

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.330 
case for it saves about 90 grams anyway
I'm<00:00:26.490> gonna<00:00:26.699> fly<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:28.130> without<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
I'm gonna fly this first without the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
I'm gonna fly this first without the
stabilization<00:00:30.029> unit<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> turned<00:00:31.260> on

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
stabilization unit on then it turned on

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.680 
stabilization unit on then it turned on
and<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> difference<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.759> video<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.660> if

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and see the difference in video see if

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
and see the difference in video see if
this<00:00:34.050> stabilization<00:00:34.410> unit<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.399> makes<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
this stabilization unit actually makes a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.549 
this stabilization unit actually makes a
big<00:00:36.270> enough<00:00:36.420> difference<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.020> tell<00:00:37.260> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
big enough difference we all tell on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.900 
big enough difference we all tell on
video<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.430> makes<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.730> big

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
video because I know it makes a big

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
video because I know it makes a big
difference<00:00:39.239> while<00:00:39.420> flying<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.530> want

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
difference while flying and I just want

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
difference while flying and I just want
to<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> effect<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:42.030> aerial

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to see the effect on some aerial

00:00:42.329 --> 00:02:51.750 
to see the effect on some aerial
photography

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.100 

alright<00:02:52.760> guys<00:02:52.940> well<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.360> finished<00:02:53.720> flying

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
alright guys well I just finished flying

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.320 
alright guys well I just finished flying
so<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.530> haven't<00:02:54.740> been<00:02:54.860> home<00:02:55.010> yet<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.430> review<00:02:56.210> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
so I haven't been home yet to review the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.700 
so I haven't been home yet to review the
video<00:02:56.600> see<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:56.990> makes<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.260> difference<00:02:57.590> but

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
video see if it makes a difference but

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.020 
video see if it makes a difference but
I'll<00:02:57.800> tell<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.010> one<00:02:58.220> thing<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I'll tell you one thing the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
I'll tell you one thing the
stabilization<00:02:59.810> yet<00:02:59.990> this<00:03:00.560> orange<00:03:00.920> our

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
stabilization yet this orange our

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.560 
stabilization yet this orange our
civilization<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.850> makes<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.120> huge<00:03:02.420> difference

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
civilization it makes a huge difference

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.320 
civilization it makes a huge difference
when<00:03:03.080> flying<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:04.070> today<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.610> maybe<00:03:04.910> eight

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
when flying out today it's maybe eight

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.620 
when flying out today it's maybe eight
mile<00:03:05.660> an<00:03:05.780> hour<00:03:05.870> winds<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.730> really<00:03:08.210> makes<00:03:08.420> a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
mile an hour winds but it really makes a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.270 
mile an hour winds but it really makes a
big<00:03:09.020> difference<00:03:09.350> at<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> plant<00:03:09.800> just<00:03:10.040> how<00:03:10.190> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
big difference at the plant just how it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.920 
big difference at the plant just how it
handles<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.730> wind<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.090> lot<00:03:11.300> better<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.660> lot<00:03:11.810> more

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
handles the wind a lot better a lot more

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.830 
handles the wind a lot better a lot more
controllable<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.710> in<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> air<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:14.300> hope<00:03:14.720> it

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
controllable up in the air and I hope it

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.240 
controllable up in the air and I hope it
makes<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.080> noticeable<00:03:15.290> difference<00:03:15.620> on<00:03:16.070> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
makes a noticeable difference on the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.970 
makes a noticeable difference on the
aerial<00:03:16.670> video<00:03:17.510> because<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.260> live<00:03:18.740> in<00:03:18.770> Chicago

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
aerial video because I live in Chicago

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.370 
aerial video because I live in Chicago
and<00:03:19.550> it's<00:03:19.640> often<00:03:20.300> windy<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
and it's often windy here and that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.260 
and it's often windy here and that
prevents<00:03:21.740> me<00:03:21.890> from<00:03:21.920> flying<00:03:22.400> many<00:03:22.670> days<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.240> I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
prevents me from flying many days so I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.660 
prevents me from flying many days so I
really<00:03:23.660> hope<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.930> thing<00:03:24.110> works<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.800> thanks

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
really hope this thing works and thanks

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.790 
really hope this thing works and thanks
for<00:03:25.730> watching
