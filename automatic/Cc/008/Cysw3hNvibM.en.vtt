you've got an oversized connector then

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.429 
you've got an oversized connector then
you're<00:02:03.540> probably<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> run<00:02:04.079> into<00:02:04.350> an

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
issue there here is a third party

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
issue there here is a third party
Lightning<00:02:06.570> connector<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> little

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
Lightning connector it's got a little

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
Lightning connector it's got a little
bit<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.690> material<00:02:09.690> around<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bit more kind of material around the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.770 
bit more kind of material around the
edges<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.340> fits<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.849> fine<00:02:12.510> as

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
edges and this one fits just fine as

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.820 
edges and this one fits just fine as
well<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> little

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
well but if you get a little

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.050 
well but if you get a little
but<00:02:13.950> larger<00:02:14.280> than<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.580> you're<00:02:14.850> probably

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but larger than that you're probably

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.000 
but larger than that you're probably
going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> run<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:15.810> issues<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.950> do

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
going to run into issues and then I do

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.030 
going to run into issues and then I do
not<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.670> iPhone<00:02:18.060> 5s<00:02:18.660> dock<00:02:19.380> I've<00:02:19.770> got<00:02:20.010> a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
not have the iPhone 5s dock I've got a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100 
not have the iPhone 5s dock I've got a
third-party<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.210> looks<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.870> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
third-party one that looks like this and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.280 
third-party one that looks like this and
this<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.430> works<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:24.360> had<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> lot<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> other

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
this actually works I had a lot of other

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.930 
this actually works I had a lot of other
cases<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.860> I've<00:02:26.100> tried<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.880> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
cases that I've tried with this and it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.850 
cases that I've tried with this and it
just<00:02:26.970> didn't<00:02:27.510> fit<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.620> actually

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
just didn't fit but this one actually

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.580 
just didn't fit but this one actually
works<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.850> that's<00:02:30.420> good<00:02:30.750> news<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.260> if<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
works so that's good news and if the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.190 
works so that's good news and if the
official<00:02:32.130> iPhone<00:02:32.520> 5s<00:02:33.030> dock<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.660> anything<00:02:34.050> like

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
official iPhone 5s dock is anything like

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.860 
official iPhone 5s dock is anything like
this<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:35.670> you're<00:02:36.270> probably<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> run

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
this then you're probably going to run

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.460 
this then you're probably going to run
into<00:02:37.520> no<00:02:38.520> problem<00:02:38.880> there<00:02:39.090> whatsoever<00:02:39.600> along

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it's somewhat challenging not nothing

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.280 
it's somewhat challenging not nothing
too<00:03:35.610> too<00:03:35.820> bad<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.330> basically<00:03:36.720> what<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> found

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
too too bad but basically what I found

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.440 
too too bad but basically what I found
is<00:03:37.620> if<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.160> work<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.519> corner<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.150> this

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
is if you work a corner just like this

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.470 
is if you work a corner just like this
on<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.750> flat<00:03:40.019> surface<00:03:40.230> same<00:03:40.739> thing<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.480> you're

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
on a flat surface same thing here you're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.550 
on a flat surface same thing here you're
going<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.720> want<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.260> flat<00:03:43.530> surface

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
going to want to do it on a flat surface

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.979 
going to want to do it on a flat surface
apply<00:03:44.280> some<00:03:44.580> pressure<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.630> comes<00:03:45.840> out

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
apply some pressure and it comes out

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.320 
apply some pressure and it comes out
just<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.100> it's<00:03:47.850> not<00:03:48.060> too<00:03:48.300> difficult

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
just like that so it's not too difficult

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.690 
just like that so it's not too difficult
but<00:03:49.080> that's<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.739> best<00:03:49.920> way<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.100> remove<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.580> in

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
but that's the best way to remove it in

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.540 
but that's the best way to remove it in
my<00:03:50.820> opinion<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.780> iPhone<00:03:52.380> 5s<00:03:52.920> case<00:03:53.310> by

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
my opinion it is the iPhone 5s case by

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.910 
my opinion it is the iPhone 5s case by
Apple<00:03:54.000> will<00:03:54.209> also<00:03:54.600> work<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.959> your<00:03:55.019> iPhone<00:03:55.560> 5

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
Apple will also work on your iPhone 5

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.560 
Apple will also work on your iPhone 5
