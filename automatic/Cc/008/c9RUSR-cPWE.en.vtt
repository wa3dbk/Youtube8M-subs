this<00:01:48.570> year<00:01:48.630> half<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> season<00:01:49.560> moves<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
Center and really up his stock I think

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600

round didn't run all that great in the
third<00:03:24.640> round<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.090> could<00:03:25.270> be<00:03:25.360> an<00:03:25.480> option<00:03:25.630> and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
third round that could be an option and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.870 
third round that could be an option and
the<00:03:26.500> more<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.710> look<00:03:26.980> at<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> more<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.610> look<00:03:27.790> at

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the more I look at it the more I look at

their needs

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.260

why<00:03:28.990> not<00:03:29.200> go<00:03:29.410> both<00:03:29.650> first<00:03:30.220> round<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.850> third

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
why not go both first round and third

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.970 
why not go both first round and third
round<00:03:31.540> will<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.140> give<00:03:32.260> some<00:03:32.470> juice<00:03:32.710> to<00:03:32.860> that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
round will it give some juice to that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
little bit of help to talk we don't

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.450 
little bit of help to talk we don't
bring<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.780> somehow<00:03:49.990> because<00:03:50.470> we<00:03:50.650> identified

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
bring it somehow because we identified

up<00:05:02.770> front<00:05:02.980> we<00:05:03.400> know<00:05:03.580> there's<00:05:03.790> a<00:05:03.880> deficiency<00:05:04.210> in

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
up front we know there's a deficiency in

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.540 
up front we know there's a deficiency in
the<00:05:04.720> pass<00:05:04.930> rush<00:05:05.260> Seattle<00:05:06.070> never<00:05:06.280> had<00:05:06.520> a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the pass rush Seattle never had a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.520 
the pass rush Seattle never had a
deficiency<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.420> pass<00:05:07.630> rush<00:05:08.020> they

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
deficiency in the pass rush they

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.650 
deficiency in the pass rush they
absolutely<00:05:08.770> loaded<00:05:09.730> up<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:10.030> them<00:05:10.210> got<00:05:10.630> a

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
absolutely loaded up on them got a

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.990 
absolutely loaded up on them got a
rotation<00:05:11.350> going<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:12.070> that's<00:05:12.280> what<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.520> look<00:05:12.730> for

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
rotation going so that's what I look for

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.730 
rotation going so that's what I look for
them<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.360> load<00:05:13.570> up<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:13.900> pass<00:05:14.140> rushes<00:05:14.560> which

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
them is to load up on pass rushes which

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.620 
them is to load up on pass rushes which
in<00:05:15.010> your<00:05:15.220> mock<00:05:15.460> draft<00:05:15.850> then<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.240> got<00:05:16.420> two

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
in your mock draft then you got two

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.840 
in your mock draft then you got two
going<00:05:16.900> in<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.410> first<00:05:17.650> three<00:05:17.920> rounds<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.490> that

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
going in the first three rounds and that

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.000 
going in the first three rounds and that
makes<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.300> lot<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.480> sense<00:05:19.810> so<00:05:19.930> faster<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.830> more

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
makes a lot of sense so faster and more

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.310 
makes a lot of sense so faster and more
athletic<00:05:21.610> in<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.880> front<00:05:22.150> and<00:05:22.390> maybe<00:05:22.870> bigger

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
athletic in the front and maybe bigger

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.010 
athletic in the front and maybe bigger
at<00:05:23.590> corner<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.250> longer<00:05:24.670> more<00:05:24.940> physical<00:05:25.840> at

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
at corner and longer more physical at

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.050 
at corner and longer more physical at
