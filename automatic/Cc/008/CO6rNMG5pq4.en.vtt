answer me

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.330 
answer me
and<00:01:06.369> then<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.640> changes<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.570> minor<00:01:08.340> which

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
and then it changes to a minor which

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.010 
and then it changes to a minor which
looks<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:15.390> index<00:01:16.390> finger<00:01:16.750> on<00:01:16.869> the

how<00:01:50.289> do<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.770> measure

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.010 

this<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.180> where<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.420> gets<00:01:55.540> tricky<00:01:55.780> because

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
this is where it gets tricky because

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.350 
this is where it gets tricky because
it's<00:01:56.320> kind<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.680> chord<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.430> don't<00:01:58.240> even

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
it's kind of a chord that I don't even

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.720 
it's kind of a chord that I don't even
know<00:01:58.570> what<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.870> is<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.230> just<00:01:59.260> kind<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.920> fiddled

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
know what it is I just kind of fiddled

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.540 
know what it is I just kind of fiddled
around<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.120> figured<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.540> out<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:02.890> keep

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
around and figured it out but it keep

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.460 
around and figured it out but it keep
the<00:02:03.850> finger<00:02:04.390> on<00:02:04.420> where<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.870> would<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.380> an

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the finger on where it would be for an

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.130 
the finger on where it would be for an
a-minor<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.670> on<00:02:06.760> that<00:02:06.940> second<00:02:07.540> string<00:02:07.810> first

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
a-minor so on that second string first

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.640 
a-minor so on that second string first
fret<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.740> then<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:10.000> next<00:02:10.600> two<00:02:10.959> fingers<00:02:11.380> while

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
fret and then the next two fingers while

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.040 
fret and then the next two fingers while
you're<00:02:11.800> going<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.950> use<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:12.280> ring<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.640> your

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you're going to use your ring in your

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.140 
you're going to use your ring in your
pinkie<00:02:14.050> actually<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> third<00:02:15.580> fret<00:02:15.940> on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
pinkie actually go on the third fret on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.050 
pinkie actually go on the third fret on
the<00:02:16.209> 3rd<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.380> 4th<00:02:17.590> string<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.610> usually

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the 3rd and 4th string and I usually

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.500 
the 3rd and 4th string and I usually
deaden<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> top<00:02:19.900> string<00:02:20.320> with<00:02:21.130> my<00:02:21.370> thumb<00:02:21.640> so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
deaden the top string with my thumb so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.479 
deaden the top string with my thumb so
then<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> makes<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:25.770> measurement<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.530> then

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
then it makes a measurement and then

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.790 
then it makes a measurement and then
from<00:02:30.790> there<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.120> goes<00:02:31.300> F<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:32.410> either<00:02:32.890> C<00:02:33.430> or<00:02:33.459> G

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
from there it goes F and either C or G

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.930 
from there it goes F and either C or G
alternating<00:02:35.800> kind<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.160> thing<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.760> goes

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
alternating kind of thing so it goes

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.740 
alternating kind of thing so it goes
measure<00:02:37.780> Ben

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:54.350 

measurement

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.670 

measure<00:02:55.050> me

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.930 

FNG<00:02:59.450> seasons<00:03:00.450> of

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.730 

so<00:03:05.480> let's<00:03:05.630> back<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.080> minor

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
so let's back to the a minor

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.180 
so let's back to the a minor
yep<00:03:08.310> see

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.710 

and<00:03:14.190> those<00:03:14.400> are<00:03:14.520> basically<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> chords

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and those are basically all the chords

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.480 
and those are basically all the chords
you<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.080> continue<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.740> do<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> same<00:03:17.280> thing

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
you just continue to do the same thing

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.830 
you just continue to do the same thing
in<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> second<00:03:18.090> verse<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.410> chorus<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.840> then

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
in the second verse and chorus and then
