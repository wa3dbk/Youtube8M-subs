hey<00:00:01.199> folks<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.010> austin<00:00:02.520> from<00:00:02.669> wonder<00:00:02.970> how

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey folks this is austin from wonder how

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.690 
hey folks this is austin from wonder how
to<00:00:03.179> calm<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.170> i<00:00:04.980> want<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.160> demonstrate<00:00:05.339> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to calm and i want to demonstrate a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.230 
to calm and i want to demonstrate a
couple<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.150> blood<00:00:06.330> switches<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.580> bud<00:00:08.580> bu

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
couple of blood switches for you bud bu

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.030 
couple of blood switches for you bud bu
d<00:00:09.510> stands<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.469> block<00:00:11.010> update<00:00:11.580> detector<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
d stands for block update detector and

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.029 
d stands for block update detector and
basically<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.460> means<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:16.039> they're

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
basically what that means is they're

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.820 
basically what that means is they're
switches<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.820> detect<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> block

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
switches that detect when a block

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.179 
switches that detect when a block
updates<00:00:21.410> yeah<00:00:22.410> i<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.560> they're<00:00:22.830> called<00:00:23.010> block

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
updates yeah i know they're called block

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
updates yeah i know they're called block
update<00:00:23.519> detectors<00:00:23.939> imagine<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:25.439> so

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
update detectors imagine that but so

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
update detectors imagine that but so
basically<00:00:26.099> there's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> there's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> glitch

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
basically there's a there's a glitch

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.990 
basically there's a there's a glitch
that<00:00:27.680> pistons<00:00:28.680> will<00:00:29.460> only<00:00:29.699> refresh<00:00:30.800> when

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
that pistons will only refresh when

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
that pistons will only refresh when
something<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.180> placed<00:00:33.510> near<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:34.020> or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
something is placed near them or

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040 
something is placed near them or
something<00:00:34.770> happens<00:00:35.670> near<00:00:35.910> them<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.239> let<00:00:36.960> me

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
something happens near them so let me

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040 
something happens near them so let me
just<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.500> give<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> an<00:00:37.829> example<00:00:38.989> see<00:00:39.989> i

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
just sort of give you an example see i

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
just sort of give you an example see i
put<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> block<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> fired<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.000> then

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
put a block down and it fired and then

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
put a block down and it fired and then
reset<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.170> I've<00:00:43.290> connected<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
reset and you can see I've connected a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
reset and you can see I've connected a
piston<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.730> basically<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.940> put

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
piston to it so basically when you put

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.740 
piston to it so basically when you put
down<00:00:48.480> okay<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> step<00:00:50.340> back<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
down okay well to take a step back the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
down okay well to take a step back the
power<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.770> piston<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.489> powered<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:56.329> because

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
power this piston is powered but because

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
power this piston is powered but because
of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.070> doesn't

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of the way that it's set up it doesn't

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.049 
of the way that it's set up it doesn't
realize<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.719> powered<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:02.070> when<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> put

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
realize that it's powered so when I put

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
realize that it's powered so when I put
a<00:01:03.090> block<00:01:03.329> down<00:01:03.739> suddenly<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> wakes<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
a block down suddenly it wakes up and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.240 
a block down suddenly it wakes up and
says<00:01:05.909> oh<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.540> getting<00:01:06.780> power<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
says oh I'm getting power but then the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
says oh I'm getting power but then the
block<00:01:08.430> moves<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> power<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> cut<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
block moves and the power is cut off and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.700 
block moves and the power is cut off and
it<00:01:10.590> goes<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> sleep<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it goes back to sleep so so this is a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.450 
it goes back to sleep so so this is a
self<00:01:14.130> resetting<00:01:14.820> bud<00:01:15.659> switch<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.460> there's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
self resetting bud switch and there's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
self resetting bud switch and there's
there's<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> variety<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> things<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
there's a variety of things that you can

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
there's a variety of things that you can
do<00:01:19.350> instead<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.430> placing<00:01:20.640> blocks<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
do instead of just placing blocks you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
do instead of just placing blocks you
can<00:01:21.710> clear<00:01:22.710> snow<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.549> hoe<00:01:24.180> grass<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:25.049> any<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
can clear snow or hoe grass or any of a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.149 
can clear snow or hoe grass or any of a
variety<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.729> things<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> self

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
variety of things but so that's a self

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
variety of things but so that's a self
resetting<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.780> does<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.140> self

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
resetting one this one does not self

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.179 
resetting one this one does not self
reset<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> different<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
reset this is a different one so if you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.910 
reset this is a different one so if you
place<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.790> block<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.750> example<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.770> will

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
place a block here for example it will

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.880 
place a block here for example it will
turn<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> updates<00:01:40.409> again

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
turn on and then when it updates again

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
turn on and then when it updates again
it<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:41.909> turn<00:01:42.090> off<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> there's<00:01:45.509> two

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it will turn off so so there's two

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
it will turn off so so there's two
different<00:01:46.140> uses<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.610> essentially<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.790> one

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
different uses and essentially this one

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300 
different uses and essentially this one
functions<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.689> switch<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> lever

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
functions like a switch like a lever

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
functions like a switch like a lever
rather<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.960> functions<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
rather and this one functions like a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.770 
rather and this one functions like a
button<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> quick<00:01:54.360> pulse<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.049> power

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
button so this is a quick pulse of power

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
button so this is a quick pulse of power
whereas<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> permanent

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
whereas this one is you know permanent

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
whereas this one is you know permanent
and<00:02:00.780> it'll<00:02:01.110> it'll<00:02:01.350> stay<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and it'll it'll stay like that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.209 
and it'll it'll stay like that
indefinitely<00:02:02.570> unless<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.290> want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> place

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
indefinitely unless you want to place

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.389 
indefinitely unless you want to place
another<00:02:05.369> block<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.799> every<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
another block and then so every time it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
another block and then so every time it
updates<00:02:08.729> it'll<00:02:09.060> it'll<00:02:09.479> change<00:02:09.780> dates<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
updates it'll it'll change dates and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.950 
updates it'll it'll change dates and
then<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
then here we have a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.310 
then here we have a
chained<00:02:14.420> self<00:02:15.420> resetting<00:02:16.130> bud<00:02:17.130> switch<00:02:17.310> array

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
chained self resetting bud switch array

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.780 
chained self resetting bud switch array
so<00:02:19.320> it's<00:02:19.680> kind<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.950> hard<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.580> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so it's kind of hard to see because you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.320 
so it's kind of hard to see because you
can't<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.720> both<00:02:21.900> sides<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.380> once<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:24.240> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
can't see both sides at once but but you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.660 
can't see both sides at once but but you
can<00:02:24.510> sort<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.020> see<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> backs<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.860> every

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
can sort of see the backs there every

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.880 
can sort of see the backs there every
time<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.880> place<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> piston<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:28.350> place<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> block

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
time I place a piston or place a block

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.320 
time I place a piston or place a block
the<00:02:29.220> piston<00:02:29.610> will<00:02:30.110> open<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:31.530> close<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the piston will open and then close and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.260 
the piston will open and then close and
this<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.840> easy<00:02:33.870> way<00:02:34.490> or<00:02:35.490> okay<00:02:36.120> well

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
this is a really easy way or okay well

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.980 
this is a really easy way or okay well
so<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.600> power<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:37.320> come<00:02:37.350> out<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.990> and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
so the power will come out of here and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.530 
so the power will come out of here and
whatever<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.680> want<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.280> fire<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.240> off<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
whatever you want to fire will be off of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.290 
whatever you want to fire will be off of
there<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.310> multiple<00:02:44.580> inputs

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
there so you can have multiple inputs

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.450 
there so you can have multiple inputs
here<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.810> anytime<00:02:46.770> something<00:02:47.430> happens

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
here and anytime something happens

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.870 
here and anytime something happens
anywhere<00:02:48.450> along<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.960> wall<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.580> power

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
anywhere along this wall the power

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.170 
anywhere along this wall the power
source<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:52.160> will<00:02:53.160> fire<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.730> anything<00:02:54.060> over

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
source will will fire and anything over

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.490 
source will will fire and anything over
there<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.990> know<00:02:55.740> go<00:02:56.070> off<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:57.500> anyway

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
there will you know go off so anyway

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.190 
there will you know go off so anyway
it's<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.550> cool<00:02:59.880> way<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.960> hide

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it's just a really cool way to to hide

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.520 
it's just a really cool way to to hide
