different to how I'd normally build my
houses<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:05.070> thought<00:01:05.549> it'd<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.790> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> fun

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
houses but I thought it'd be kind of fun

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.170 
houses but I thought it'd be kind of fun
to<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.510> something<00:01:06.659> different<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
to do something different so this is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
to do something different so this is
just<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> random<00:01:09.720> sim<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
just a random sim that I have here this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940 
just a random sim that I have here this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
is my dummy sim Molly that I always put

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
is my dummy sim Molly that I always put
in<00:01:14.220> houses<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:14.880> editing<00:01:15.119> or<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.320> I'm

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
in houses when I'm editing or when I'm

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
in houses when I'm editing or when I'm
taking<00:01:16.619> pictures<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.189> doing<00:01:17.729> fun<00:01:18.119> views<00:01:18.390> of

the house so we're just gonna go ahead

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.649 
the house so we're just gonna go ahead
and<00:01:21.060> hide<00:01:21.360> her<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> house<00:01:24.390> it's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
watch area at the top which I thought

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
watch area at the top which I thought

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
whether I wanted to do like a flat roof

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520 
whether I wanted to do like a flat roof
or<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.689> give<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> regular<00:01:34.200> roof

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
or if I was gonna give it a regular roof

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.679 
or if I was gonna give it a regular roof
but<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.070> thought<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> unique

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
but I thought it kind of made a unique

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.770 
but I thought it kind of made a unique
style<00:01:36.990> by<00:01:37.229> having<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:38.390> roof<00:01:39.390> area

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
style by having that little roof area

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
style by having that little roof area
there<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> back<00:01:42.030> we've

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
there so as you look at the back we've

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.219 
there so as you look at the back we've
got<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.520> porch<00:01:44.520> area<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.329> we've<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.600> an<00:01:45.750> indoor

start by just having a quick tour inside
so<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.290> look<00:02:13.470> at<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.710> bottom<00:02:14.100> floor<00:02:14.460> we've

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760

of small and cozy

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040 
of small and cozy
I<00:02:31.770> guess<00:02:32.100> maybe<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> Sparta<00:02:33.480> family<00:02:33.840> home

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
I guess maybe like a Sparta family home

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.260 
I guess maybe like a Sparta family home
for<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.740> family<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:35.850> maybe<00:02:36.060> one

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
for a family with just a like maybe one

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.590 
for a family with just a like maybe one
child<00:02:36.300> or<00:02:36.720> something<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:39.060> we've<00:02:39.180> got<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
child or something but we've got like a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.050 
child or something but we've got like a
little<00:02:39.780> open<00:02:40.260> kitchen<00:02:40.800> slash<00:02:41.400> living<00:02:41.910> room

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
little open kitchen slash living room

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.460 
little open kitchen slash living room
area<00:02:42.450> which<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.750> guess<00:02:42.900> she<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.170> fill<00:02:43.380> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
area which I guess she can fill up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.890 
area which I guess she can fill up
herself<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.460> where<00:02:44.610> she<00:02:44.790> likes<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.330> figured

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
herself but where she likes I figured

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.480 
herself but where she likes I figured
this<00:02:45.990> could<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> downstairs<00:02:47.010> bathroom

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
this could be like a downstairs bathroom

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.250 
this could be like a downstairs bathroom
slash<00:02:48.270> laundry<00:02:48.930> unit<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.700> walks<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.750> if

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
slash laundry unit and then walks out if

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
slash laundry unit and then walks out if
she<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.530> walk<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:53.130> into<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
she can walk out here into the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.950 
she can walk out here into the
conservatory<00:02:54.750> which<00:02:54.870> has<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.890> spa

gonna do it out to a pool but I thought
indoor<00:03:02.190> kind<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.460> made<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.610> look<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> little<00:03:02.940> bit

more<00:03:03.270> unique<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.980> that's<00:03:04.980> what<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.250> went<00:03:05.370> with

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
more unique so that's what we went with
