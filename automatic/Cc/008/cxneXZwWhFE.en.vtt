00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.549
 these medullary cells released in the presence of any organ 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.660
 transplanted in this case the pancreatic islets are able to induce 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.880
 tolerance ie making the body 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.880
 no recipes plus the transplanted organ 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.000
 there is a disease that is constantly increasing partly linked also to the way of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.170
 feed 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.619
 and diabetes came 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.640
 in Italy it affects three million people well 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.960
 the consequences are not just particular individual 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 as for the kingdoms 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 but also social due to decreasing health costs to which governments in everything 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410
 the world of bono photo 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.020
 a new perspective of assistant care work I learn 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.319
 an Italian researcher from the University of Harvard 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:51.800
 in the United States 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.260
 received an important award for a study that would allow to realize 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.160
 pancreas cell transplantation 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 and thus to solve the problem of insulin deficiency 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.850
 barbara gallavotti hey gianmarco more explain to us exactly what it is 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.920
 while the great killers of the modern world 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.320
 next to cardiovascular diseases, aids and malaria, diabetes occupies a place 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.550
 decidedly significant 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.500
 it is estimated that approximately one million die from diabetes-related causes each year 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.660
 of people 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.820
 in the united states it suffers about 10% of the population that is 20 million 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.420
 three million people of whom are not children a boy 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.940
 in Italy the diabetes patients are about 3 million 5% of Italians and in 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.840
 the whole world is calculated to be there 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.360
 180 million destined to become 300 million by 2025 is enough for 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.370
 talk about a real emergency 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.860
 from the enormous costs also for the governments that should sustain the expenses of 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.500
 health care 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.530
 at the origin of diabetes there is kiss capacity of the organism 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 to produce insulin 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.069
 a hormone that regulates the concentration of sugar in the blood 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.819
 insulin is produced by specialized cells that are found in the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.349
 pancreas 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.709
 sometimes the same body destroys this sky 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.709
 due to reactions called autoimmune 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.309
 in other cases the death of pancreatic cells is due to a diet 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.629
 wrong 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.360
 we do not yet know what is happening 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.110
 but perhaps a diet too rich in sugars carbohydrates subjects the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.530
 Pancreatic cells overworked in the long run to kill 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 at the moment there is no cure to recover from diabetes 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.359
 the only possibility and keep it under control with daily injections of 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.229
 insulin 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.969
 an operation strictly necessary because the total lack of this 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:52.520
 hormone 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.179
 quickly leads to death 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.009
 but there are still problems 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.879
 sky under normal conditions the organism regulates with great accuracy the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.059
 release of insulin based on the amount and type of food we eat 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.459
 a dosage done from the outside with an injection 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.079
 it can never be as precise 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.760
 for this reason in the diabetes patients the level of sugar in the blood 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.459
 it still suffers low 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.919
 which can have serious consequences 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.449
 especially the kingdoms are in danger 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.059
 10 years from the beginning of treatment with insulin are damaged 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.789
 over a third of patients 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.549
 a solution to cure diabetes could be implant in the sick 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.589
 healthy pancreatic cells taken from a donor 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.649
 these are indicated in the pinewood where they begin their work as a producer 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:42.249
 of insulin 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.689
 shape for a problem 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.469
 the risk that the patient's immune system will rebel against the introduction 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.660
 of new cells 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.979
 it says yes 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:55.309
 paolo fiorina an italian researcher transferred to the rule of cosculluela 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.419
 in the United States 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.659
 has dedicated himself to studying a way to prevent the body of diabetics from 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.659
 reject newly received pancreatic cells 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.470
 his research has been conducted on mice for now 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.009
 and not yet on man 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.439
 but the results are very promising to the point that the work of paolo fiorina e 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.739
 just been awarded with a prestigious award 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.870
 that the American transplantation society reports better research with 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.759
 impact on diabetes 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.860
 let's see what it is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.809
 the study starts from an important discovery 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.659
 if a large quantity of the so-called are introduced into the bloodstream 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.409
 stamina cells 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.020
 these after a certain time have the effect of reprogramming the system 

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:41.129
 immune by convincing you have a reject the pancreas cells a 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.259
 coming from a donor 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.919
 the operation with the greatest probability of success if the stem cells are produced 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.069
 from the patient's own body 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.840
 however, these types of cells are normally segregated within the 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:55.029
 bone marrow 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.029
 how to free them in the bloodstream 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.770
 paolo fiorina 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.669
 found that the problem can be solved by giving patients one 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.949
 molecule with the complicated name cxc r4 antagonist 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.580
 this water molecule so that the stem cells imprisoned in the marrow of the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.940
 bones can get into the bloodstream and get carried away 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.539
 the whole organism 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.199
 these medullary cells released 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.340
 in the presence of any transplanted organ in this case the islands 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.440
 Pancreatic are able to induce tolerance to make that 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.350
 the body 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.309
 no recipes plus the transplanted organ 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.450
 this is extremely important because it allows first 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.830
 diabetes care 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.990
 obtained by pancreatic islets transplanted into the same patient in 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.219
 second place 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.099
 the non-use of long-term immunosuppressive therapy 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.369
 the first tests carried out on mice in the laboratory showed that 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.889
 animals react very well to treatment 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.479
 and after a certain time they accept the new pancreatic cells with their own 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.219
 in the coming years further investigations will be carried out and the drug will be 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.129
 tried on a man 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.470
 if its effectiveness was confirmed 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.990
 we could say that we have taken a big step towards the development of 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.659
 a cure for diabetes 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.119
 a fact that could change the lives of hundreds of millions for the better 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.199
 people 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.589
 and it would be a largely Italian result 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:29.240
 since it was obtained by a researcher from our country 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.900
 with a strong research experience at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.600
 the study, however, took place at the low-necked medical harvard 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.199
 which also funded it 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.509
 this American research center alone has more funds than all 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.099
 Italian universities put together a figure that makes us think about the results 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:52.389
 that could reach our researchers if a 3 ein the incidence e 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.030
 preparation had even more resources available
