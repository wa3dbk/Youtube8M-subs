00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.670 
children will flourish but if they do
it's<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.459> lightning<00:02:32.700> rod<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.049> rest<00:02:34.319> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's the lightning rod for the rest of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.180 
it's the lightning rod for the rest of
the<00:02:35.010> cosmos<00:02:35.519> we<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.330> help<00:02:36.599> those<00:02:36.840> races<00:02:37.410> but

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the cosmos we can help those races but

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.490 
the cosmos we can help those races but
the<00:02:38.250> answer<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.299> them<00:02:39.840> coming<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.319> earth

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the answer is not them coming to earth

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
the answer is not them coming to earth
and<00:02:40.709> starting<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.220> live<00:02:41.430> here

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and starting to live here

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.670 
and starting to live here
this<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.870> humanity's<00:02:43.530> habitat<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:45.290> also<00:02:46.290> them

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
this is humanity's habitat and also them

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.309 
this is humanity's habitat and also them
introducing<00:02:47.610> animals<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.690> from<00:02:48.959> Nibiru

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
introducing animals like from Nibiru

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.780 
introducing animals like from Nibiru
like<00:02:50.010> cows

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
like cows

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.259 
like cows
now<00:02:51.209> everybody<00:02:51.690> drinks<00:02:52.049> cow's<00:02:52.319> milk<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:54.150> you

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
now everybody drinks cow's milk can you

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.410 
now everybody drinks cow's milk can you
see<00:02:54.780> how<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.170> would<00:02:55.349> change<00:02:55.620> our<00:02:55.890> frequency<00:02:56.609> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
see how it would change our frequency so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.470 
see how it would change our frequency so
the<00:02:57.540> bottom<00:02:57.840> line<00:02:58.049> if<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.470> when<00:02:59.129> we<00:02:59.480> ingest

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the bottom line if it is when we ingest

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.240 
the bottom line if it is when we ingest
milk<00:03:01.430> from<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.329> has<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.250> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
milk from something that has the that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.830 
milk from something that has the that
has<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:06.440> Sun<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.709> other<00:03:07.950> planets<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:09.269> is

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
has the Sun of other planets it is

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.550 
has the Sun of other planets it is
damaging<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:11.489> humanity<00:03:13.700> okay

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
damaging to humanity okay

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.009 
damaging to humanity okay
these<00:03:16.560> are<00:03:16.799> past<00:03:17.069> stories<00:03:17.780> these<00:03:18.780> are

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
these are past stories these are

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.349 
these are past stories these are
differently<00:03:19.530> possible<00:03:20.280> stories<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
differently possible stories so the

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:32.910 
differently possible stories so the
little<00:03:21.569> bug<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:22.019> go<00:03:22.200> away<00:03:22.349> it's<00:03:23.130> not<00:03:23.819> anymore

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.980
