00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.770
 we are now in london and lg has 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.910
 just her new flagship the lg 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.490
 g3 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.320
 a lot had already leaked out prematurely 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.269
 including through lg even a few 10 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.499
 videos released by the outside world 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.509
 all the staff outside for months 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.220
 but also lg netherlands itself 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.529
 all specifications one day in advance 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.539
 and pass photos online we put said 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.669
 is now in London is very busy 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.619
 but now I have the LG G3 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.390
 my hands and are very impressive 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.530
 device in this video I love you 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.520
 tell everything 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.870
 sorry that picture maybe a bit 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.190
 appears but the ones are a bit special 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.359
 drugs around us and people walk like 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.010
 a fool around us so I can 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.420
 otherwise do little but we do 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.410
 the best thing about our image was the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.059
 flower height 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.039
 locally if you have very little left over 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.769
 release keys which is clear 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.969
 you start the lg g3 in korea 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.649
 would be left but that to 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.079
 The Netherlands is still completely unclear 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.449
 what is clear is that so 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.510
 probably just like the lg g2 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.129
 6 weeks further announcement launched 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.600
 will be going and shows that he 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.250
 about mid-July we entered 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.530
 Netherlands will come out 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.579
 Well that means taking into account the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.930
 is that we each have the device in front 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.240
 can go to the shops in August 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.680
 and that is certainly a nice bonus 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.299
 so was already going out in five colors 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.220
 come i have you the silver variant 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 someone who looks particularly beautiful 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.090
 mc what is special is that device from 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.950
 built all the way and that he is whole 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.020
 is very light and that is really very bad 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.250
 particularly light on between food 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.619
 in my hand and I really didn't have that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.869
 expected from aluminum design to the lg 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.680
 g3 has another big advantage 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.420
 for a lot of people 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.009
 and if that the back also sometime 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.659
 let go 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.009
 which owns another once you see 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.719
 memory expansion that was a big one 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.799
 missed at the lg g2 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.600
 you can expand the memory by 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.740
 118 gigabytes in the middle 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 In addition, you can also change the battery 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.869
 replace that also finds many people 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.399
 important 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.229
 nevertheless the back is very bad 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.909
 nicely finished oh the edges are made of 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.469
 whoever made you the front looks very 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 neat and out foot 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.860
 very much in the hands and I have 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.939
 here a korean version in my hands 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.920
 which is already going to the Dutch version 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.030
 but get this korean version and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.740
 also a nice antenna for it 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.289
 dvb-h so you can also watch your TV 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 in korea with your lg g3 as your korean 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.220
 variant but it will be the dutch 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.750
 variant is not tasty 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.210
 back to dutch version only too 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.800
 specifications there are 5 point 5 inch 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.160
 got a screen with a quad hd 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.870
 resolution 2560 times 1440 pixels 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.550
 it looks really come out very nice 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.840
 on the one on back then we put the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.830
 quark at eight o'clock a process 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.720
 received 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.980
 they ac variant this does its job 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 two and half richards 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.210
 2 gigabytes of ram, so this one 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.190
 two gigabytes of ram applies to the 16 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.290
 gigabyte version and would be 32 gigabytes 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.450
 version came to the market and these have 3 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.550
 gigabyte with her 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.970
 Another advantage of this LG G3 is the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.340
 battery 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.630
 in addition to a few handy trick 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.850
 added in the software is also the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.740
 battery itself is rather large 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 your battery 3000 miliampÃ¨re what for 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.650
 must ensure that between easy one day 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.360
 must go with you to be able to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 test here now but the magazine anyway 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.780
 much reimbursed the other is a big advantage 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.459
 Also that the battery is interchangeable so that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.080
 the back is removable and therefore 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.730
 could battery fall for example 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.220
 replaced and then also stings large 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.959
 benefit for many people 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.209
 in addition, there is a 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.090
 what is special about this camera is that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.830
 here via reader autofocus so he 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.230
 is shooting a laser beam on the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.120
 person or item you are trying 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.060
 and by taking that fast measurement 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.989
 0.0 0.2 seconds in milliseconds 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.640
 even say 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.620
 and you know the focus have to slightly 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.940
 tested a pretty good one 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.320
 have to really think about the devices 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.550
 Still detail firmware he turns to 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.180
 have another month to do it 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.040
 all of them 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.810
 yes a little smoother to run 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.100
 He knows how to focus very quickly 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.500
 a certain object 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.880
 and that is really a very big advantage 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.860
 the room also looks good from the picture 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.330
 looks good from the clarity their study 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.590
 good looking and also the camera on the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.570
 front has a larger sensor 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.160
 inherited which gives you better selfies 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.269
 can shoot according to lg 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.890
 all you have to do is the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.700
 devices he language your hand on 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.320
 stabbing 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.049
 and so the matter will take the same 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.130
 and that we are actually quite good 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.230
 then out the screen that maybe the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.150
 biggest asset of this lg where the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.769
 Sony's largest competitors and HTC 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.970
 Samsung still with a full HD screen 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.709
 walk around 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480
 know lg first in the market one 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.220
 quarter HD screen 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.780
 the quad hd screen looks really special 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.640
 good if we for example just one 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 video boot then it is special 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.870
 lively about what strikes me is that 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.280
 I also look very good 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.379
 well now i have a video too 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.519
 so we started to the full hd k 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.780
 i can't transfer so well though 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.579
 just looks really really good 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.169
 it is really a very nice delivery 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.419
 also the screen brightness 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.010
 is good by color saturation is good and 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.050
 what also stands out in that from this also the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.180
 viewing angle is also particularly good that is for sure 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.620
 a big advantage for this lg 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.419
 another big advantage is that the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.130
 edges around the screen particularly small 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.960
 and that causes the device 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.620
 actually very handy is a no 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.540
 very large 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.550
 despite being in five point 5 in screen 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.020
 has been given so very much at the time 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.580
 You can collect with your thumb 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.310
 and I think that's a big deal 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.750
 plus actually and then something also the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.300
 speed and gi 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.280
 All of these you might have what LG actually has 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.960
 made a lot of changes to viewer and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.060
 I really think that's a big plus 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.229
 lg always found you why with her 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.940
 bit of a funfair 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.919
 we have now finally adjusted them 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.510
 have your presents to you to your own 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.729
 and said basically he is just in 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.789
 July is but the joejoe blows you to pieces 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.600
 nicer quiet and uncluttered 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.910
 his predecessor 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.410
 and that is certainly a big plus 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.300
 all that coach looks neat 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.280
 being round and redesigned 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.050
 square icons in color too 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.389
 much better than its predecessor 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740
 and that is certainly a big plus 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.530
 Well what on it that wo n't do 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.539
 Snappy is like I had hoped it is 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.370
 best en but not so actually 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.770
 spontaneous as other devices product 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.820
 so xps two the samsung galaxy s5 or 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.340
 other devices 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.720
 I actually expected that I order 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.430
 it is not yet clear I think myself 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.820
 that is because of the better for medium 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.500
 turns 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
 student ate lunch that much 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.220
 for these problems 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.660
 but not for your devices 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.160
 you really feel it 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.199
 maybe that is actually yes 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.500
 the lg fracture will dissolve 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.210
 towards the groin what stands out even more 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.370
 i said the camera i have a jua 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.320
 I own do profile design and then 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.849
 that is really very nicely finished that 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.130
 something I am not so used to from LG 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.410
 bent lg and samsung are all well-known 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.630
 me if it's manufacturers that you don't 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.820
 uses some beer materials and lg 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.289
 fortunately Samsung is still there 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.669
 what I find a great loss 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.560
 I actually abandoned that 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.139
 I think the LG G3 is really a nice device 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.710
 that nicely holds a nice screen 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.300
 has 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.860
 Also, the buttons on the back, we 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.120
 now a lot better DJ too 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.570
 better service, I also think is great 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.610
 plus point 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.290
 he looks very calmly uncluttered 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.070
 and then just very light and one 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.350
 dick design 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.060
 So I think that really, really fine Love 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.830
 you would be the one who also equips with 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.690
 new number of accessories 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.460
 these accessories include a more new one 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.810
 place where from the circle cover denominators 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.850
 this this cover 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.410
 looks best did you say flip case and 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.820
 The advantage of that is that you are increasing 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.620
 so can 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.570
 yes really notifications on a road can 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.240
 see can thereby record you can sms 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.990
 mail also sent by the way 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.550
 that's pretty handy 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.770
 Another full is also that this device 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.110
 has wireless charging as standard 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.520
 and if you actually like this smart cover 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.260
 then it will just as well 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.120
 wirelessly charged colors 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.050
 also without suitcase or with suitcase 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.760
 then they can always be wireless 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.900
 being charged that big advantage 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.490
 In addition, there will also be a new headset 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.870
 included are stereo bluetooht 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.810
 headset that looks pretty good 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.100
 was of course nice too 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.020
 lg will also have a number 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.640
 other accessories including another 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.500
 few other suitcases or where 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.180
 make available in any case via 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.100
 the different stores so that would too 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.940
 all that ice is going out of your groin 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.620
 come 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.300
 the lg g so that's probably from 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.740
 be in the affair in July 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.710
 the suggested retail price is not yet due to LG 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.330
 announced I assume that 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.980
 699 euros in terms of suggested retail price 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.810
 if not entirely clear but with this one 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.610
 specifications are not possible 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.580
 everything I do not assume that device 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.960
 550 will cost like the lg g2 did 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.430
 soda that just came out 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.290
 but nevertheless, lg became indirect 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.920
 impressive premium to gear down 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.450
 put 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.010
 and we can already wait for him 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.190
 available in you in the Netherlands 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.190
 is becoming
