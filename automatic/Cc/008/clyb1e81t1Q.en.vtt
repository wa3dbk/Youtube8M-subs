messy ibero Cavani Aguero and dum ba
which<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:44.949> too<00:03:45.129> many<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.609> try<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:45.909> sell<00:03:46.150> dum

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
which is just too many I try to sell dum

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.949 
which is just too many I try to sell dum
ba<00:03:46.569> but<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.169> didn't<00:03:47.409> actually<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.769> through<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
ba but it didn't actually go through and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.149 
ba but it didn't actually go through and
which<00:03:49.959> kind<00:03:50.199> of<00:03:50.259> disappointing<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:50.919> this

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
which kind of disappointing but this

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.409 
which kind of disappointing but this
year<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.519> screamer<00:03:51.849> their<00:03:52.000> only<00:03:52.150> reason<00:03:52.359> I

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
year the screamer their only reason I

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.030 
year the screamer their only reason I
think<00:03:52.479> we'll<00:03:52.750> blowed<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> more<00:03:53.229> is<00:03:53.409> because<00:03:53.590> I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
think we'll blowed it more is because I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.159 
think we'll blowed it more is because I
don't<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.090> time<00:03:55.299> to<00:03:55.659> edit<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.930> because

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
don't have time to edit it because

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.699 
don't have time to edit it because
editing<00:03:56.530> takes<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.159> so<00:03:57.459> long<00:03:57.699> and<00:03:58.569> like<00:03:59.259> just

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
editing takes so so long and like just

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.170 
editing takes so so long and like just
getting<00:03:59.919> down<00:04:00.099> the<00:04:00.250> cause<00:04:00.430> because<00:04:00.819> of<00:04:01.060> all

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
getting down the cause because of all

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.599 
getting down the cause because of all
the<00:04:01.299> games<00:04:01.509> that<00:04:01.689> there<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.370> all<00:04:03.549> the

versa so I thought you know what we'll
split<00:04:41.220> up<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:42.060> then<00:04:42.210> kill<00:04:42.389> what<00:04:42.570> we<00:04:42.690> use<00:04:42.810> again

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080

on<00:04:43.169> either<00:04:43.320> videos<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:44.370> no<00:04:44.520> idea<00:04:44.849> that<00:04:45.030> I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
on either videos it's no idea that I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.240 
on either videos it's no idea that I
just<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.479> fun<00:04:45.690> obviously<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:48.330> that's<00:04:48.509> that

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
just it for fun obviously so that's that

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.290 
just it for fun obviously so that's that
and<00:04:50.250> what<00:04:50.370> people<00:04:50.490> said<00:04:50.759> that<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.940> made<00:04:51.090> too

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
and what people said that I made too

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.879 
and what people said that I made too
many<00:04:51.449> signings<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.169> August<00:04:52.470> transfer

window I made three I made Robin robbery
Modric<00:04:58.729> hazard<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.910> think<00:05:00.060> that's<00:05:00.300> too<00:05:00.509> many

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
Modric hazard I think that's too many

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.260 
Modric hazard I think that's too many
and<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.949> guess<00:05:02.099> they<00:05:02.250> mean<00:05:02.370> maybe<00:05:02.669> changed<00:05:03.150> it

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
and I guess they mean maybe changed it

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.029 
and I guess they mean maybe changed it
too<00:05:03.419> much<00:05:03.599> on<00:05:03.870> I'm<00:05:04.169> assuming<00:05:04.830> that's<00:05:04.919> what

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
too much on I'm assuming that's what

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.040 
too much on I'm assuming that's what
they<00:05:05.190> mean<00:05:05.400> when<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:06.180> say<00:05:06.389> too<00:05:06.449> many<00:05:06.660> but<00:05:06.900> yeah<00:05:07.020> a

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
they mean when I say too many but yeah a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.300 
they mean when I say too many but yeah a
lot<00:05:07.169> people<00:05:07.289> requested<00:05:07.830> that's<00:05:07.949> got<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.160> few

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
lot people requested that's got a few

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.790 
lot people requested that's got a few
ideas<00:05:08.370> as<00:05:08.759> well<00:05:08.880> for<00:05:09.120> career<00:05:09.330> mode<00:05:09.620> at<00:05:10.620> least

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
ideas as well for career mode at least

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.320 
ideas as well for career mode at least
with<00:05:10.949> this<00:05:11.070> one<00:05:11.310> where<00:05:11.580> I'm<00:05:11.729> going<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.940> do<00:05:12.030> goal
