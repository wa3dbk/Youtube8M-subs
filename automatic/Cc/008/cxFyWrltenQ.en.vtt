minimum 720p video and that's what these

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160 
minimum 720p video and that's what these
do<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.190> 1366<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.489> way<00:00:44.670> by<00:00:44.850> 768<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.989> way

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
little bit get a slightly higher

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
little bit get a slightly higher

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that's going to give you that on top of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.070 
that's going to give you that on top of
all<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.340> does<00:03:02.460> have<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:02.790> high

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
all of that it does have a very high

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.360 
all of that it does have a very high
horizontal<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.260> vertical<00:03:04.890> viewing<00:03:05.160> angle

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
horizontal and vertical viewing angle

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.250 
horizontal and vertical viewing angle
and<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.520> refers<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.080> whether<00:03:07.080> you're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
and that refers to whether you're

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.690 
and that refers to whether you're
looking<00:03:07.350> at<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.010> looks<00:03:08.190> great<00:03:08.460> but

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
looking at it here it looks great but

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.100 
looking at it here it looks great but
how<00:03:08.820> far<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.390> start<00:03:09.600> looking<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.990> from

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
how far can you start looking at it from

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.320 
how far can you start looking at it from
the<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.380> before<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.920> picture<00:03:11.070> goes<00:03:11.340> away<00:03:11.610> so

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the side before the picture goes away so

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.430 
the side before the picture goes away so
in<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:12.840> you're<00:03:12.930> looking<00:03:13.020> at<00:03:13.260> somewhere

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
in this one you're looking at somewhere

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.710 
in this one you're looking at somewhere
around<00:03:13.500> 160<00:03:14.280> degrees<00:03:14.580> which<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.450> actually

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
around 160 degrees which is actually

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.260 
around 160 degrees which is actually
quite<00:03:15.930> high<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:17.220> monitor<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:17.970> for

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
quite high on a monitor like this for

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.729 
quite high on a monitor like this for
monitor<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.750> value<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.320> really<00:03:19.590> good

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
monitor this value it's a really good

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.040 
monitor this value it's a really good
deal<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.520> get<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.670> really<00:03:20.910> nice<00:03:21.180> side<00:03:21.750> viewing

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
deal you get a really nice side viewing

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.420 
deal you get a really nice side viewing
angle<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.620> hoard<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:23.010> vertical

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
angle as well as a hoard of vertical

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.500 
angle as well as a hoard of vertical
viewing<00:03:23.610> angle<00:03:23.760> which<00:03:23.850> means<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.450> you're

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
viewing angle which means if you're

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.690 
viewing angle which means if you're
looking<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.140> way<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.620> kind<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.520> lose

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
looking at it this way I kind of lose

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.610 
looking at it this way I kind of lose
the<00:03:26.880> picture<00:03:27.120> quality<00:03:27.270> about<00:03:27.630> right<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the picture quality about right here and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.990 
the picture quality about right here and
that's<00:03:28.800> about<00:03:28.890> 160<00:03:29.489> degrees<00:03:29.520> if<00:03:29.850> you're

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
that's about 160 degrees if you're

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.150 
that's about 160 degrees if you're
facing<00:03:30.330> me<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> were<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.690> measure<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.380> it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
facing me you were to measure it so it's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.310 
facing me you were to measure it so it's
also<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.970> very<00:03:33.150> good<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.480> as<00:03:33.690> well

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
also very very good for that as well

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.050 
also very very good for that as well
and<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:35.190> pacing<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.550> comes<00:03:35.670> everything<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and in pacing it comes everything you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.660 
and in pacing it comes everything you
want<00:03:36.239> also<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.860> check<00:03:38.550> out<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
want also just so you know check out the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.340 
want also just so you know check out the
back<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:38.970> thing<00:03:39.030> right<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:39.900> see<00:03:40.260> these

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
back of this thing right here see these

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.420 
back of this thing right here see these
four<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:40.980> holes

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
four little holes

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.310 
four little holes
these<00:03:41.700> are<00:03:41.880> VES<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.450> mounting<00:03:42.840> hole<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.230> you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
these are VES a mounting hole so if you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.720 
these are VES a mounting hole so if you
wanted<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.709> hook<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:43.980> up<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.489> an

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
wanted to hook this up on an

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.830 
wanted to hook this up on an
articulating<00:03:45.239> arm<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.570> can<00:03:45.630> have<00:03:45.780> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
articulating arm so you can have a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.090 
articulating arm so you can have a
couple<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.200> them<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.410> move<00:03:46.560> them<00:03:46.590> around<00:03:46.770> if

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
couple of them and move them around if

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.560 
couple of them and move them around if
you<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> put<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.520> up<00:03:47.580> on<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.730> wall<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.300> flat

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
you want to put it up on a wall and flat

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.540 
you want to put it up on a wall and flat
mount<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.020> you<00:03:49.350> could<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.770> that<00:03:49.920> not<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> problem

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
mount it you could do that not a problem

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.340 
mount it you could do that not a problem
it<00:03:50.700> does<00:03:51.030> fit<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.600> very<00:03:51.810> compatible<00:03:52.110> and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it does fit it's very compatible and

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.110 
it does fit it's very compatible and
this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> universal<00:03:53.100> mount<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.459> pretty

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
this is the universal mount that pretty

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
this is the universal mount that pretty
much<00:03:54.180> all<00:03:54.390> monitors<00:03:55.050> use<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:56.100> they<00:03:56.370> are

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
much all monitors use if they are

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400 
much all monitors use if they are
compatible<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.390> mount<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:57.900> articulating

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
compatible to mount on an articulating

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.229 
compatible to mount on an articulating
arm<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.709> called<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> ESA<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.880> 100

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
arm it's called the ESA is a 100

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.340 
arm it's called the ESA is a 100
millimeter<00:04:00.390> mount<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.900> it'll<00:04:01.080> work<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.260> just

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
millimeter mount and it'll work on just

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.500 
millimeter mount and it'll work on just
about<00:04:01.500> everything<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.310> also<00:04:02.730> not<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
about everything so that's also not a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.150 
about everything so that's also not a
problem<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.680> basically

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
problem you can do that so basically

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.620 
problem you can do that so basically
it's<00:04:05.640> got<00:04:05.760> all<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.030> nice<00:04:06.150> little<00:04:06.390> features

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
it's got all the nice little features

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.790 
it's got all the nice little features
that<00:04:06.660> you'd<00:04:06.840> want<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.230> nice<00:04:07.350> little<00:04:07.470> monitor

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
that you'd want in a nice little monitor
