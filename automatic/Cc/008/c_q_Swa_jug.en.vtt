a<00:00:35.000> small<00:00:35.360> store<00:00:35.750> i<00:00:36.400> think<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:37.519> was<00:00:37.610> a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
a small store i think it was a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.710 
a small store i think it was a
spanish-speaking<00:00:38.360> store<00:00:38.960> but<00:00:39.260> went<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.129> there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
spanish-speaking store but went in there

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.700 
spanish-speaking store but went in there
looking<00:00:41.720> around<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.080> he<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.440> sterno

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
looking around that he not the sterno

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.180 
looking around that he not the sterno
but<00:00:43.040> i<00:00:43.250> happen<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:43.699> find<00:00:43.730> these<00:00:44.800> there<00:00:45.800> i

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
but i happen to find these there i

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.410 
but i happen to find these there i
thought<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:47.000> was<00:00:47.199> imusa<00:00:48.610> but<00:00:49.610> i<00:00:49.909> don't<00:00:50.330> think

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
thought it was imusa but i don't think

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.689 
thought it was imusa but i don't think
so<00:00:50.839> because<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.470> says<00:00:54.760> HECO<00:00:55.760> an<00:00:56.119> Colombia<00:00:57.699> made

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
so because it says HECO an Colombia made

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.210 
so because it says HECO an Colombia made
in<00:00:58.879> Colombia<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.860> can<00:01:00.860> see<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.330> so<00:01:03.220> these

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
in Colombia I can see that so these

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.359 
in Colombia I can see that so these
aren't<00:01:04.489> I<00:01:04.760> guess<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.659> Musa<00:01:06.190> I've<00:01:07.190> had

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.330 
just do a test on this to see how well
this<00:01:26.869> works<00:01:27.200> compared<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.750> Boy<00:01:30.649> Scout<00:01:31.009> pot

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
this works compared to the Boy Scout pot

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.700 
this works compared to the Boy Scout pot
it's<00:01:32.179> about<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.630> same<00:01:32.840> size<00:01:35.200> not<00:01:36.200> quite<00:01:36.560> as

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's about the same size not quite as

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.980 
it's about the same size not quite as
tall<00:01:36.950> maybe<00:01:37.249> but<00:01:37.999> about<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.210> same<00:01:38.359> size<00:01:38.749> in

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
tall maybe but about the same size in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.200 
tall maybe but about the same size in
diameter<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.130> diameter<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:42.969> five<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:43.999> a<00:01:44.179> half

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
diameter the diameter is five and a half

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.959 
diameter the diameter is five and a half
inches<00:01:44.509> by<00:01:44.990> two<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.469> half<00:01:45.619> inches<00:01:45.770> tall<00:01:46.249> and

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
inches by two and a half inches tall and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.279 
inches by two and a half inches tall and
what<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.179> think<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.569> kind<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.869> neat<00:01:48.049> about<00:01:48.170> this

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
what I think is kind of neat about this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.029 
what I think is kind of neat about this
is<00:01:48.909> it's<00:01:49.909> got<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.149> combination<00:01:50.780> handle<00:01:51.289> clamp

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
is it's got a combination handle clamp

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.450 
is it's got a combination handle clamp
to<00:01:52.249> hold<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.579> shut<00:01:53.890> opens<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:55.039> just<00:01:55.069> like<00:01:55.399> that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
to hold it shut opens up just like that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.459 
to hold it shut opens up just like that
so<00:01:56.359> you<00:01:56.450> have<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.600> handle<00:01:57.049> with<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.130> lid<00:01:59.469> has

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
so you have a handle with it the lid has

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.429 
so you have a handle with it the lid has
a<00:02:00.770> rubber<00:02:01.219> gasket<00:02:01.460> around<00:02:01.939> it<00:02:02.299> which<00:02:03.109> comes

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
a rubber gasket around it which comes

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.770 
a rubber gasket around it which comes
out<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:04.069> don't<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.579> if<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.880> heat<00:02:05.420> up<00:02:05.450> or

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
out I don't know if you can heat up or

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.469 
out I don't know if you can heat up or
cook<00:02:06.020> with<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.380> gasket<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:07.179> but<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.300> comes

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
cook with this gasket in but it comes

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.470 
cook with this gasket in but it comes
out<00:02:08.660> fairly<00:02:09.560> easy<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.399> then<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> lid<00:02:11.450> goes

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
out fairly easy and then the lid goes

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.350 
out fairly easy and then the lid goes
back<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:11.960> top<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.209> your

if<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.570> works<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.200> mean<00:02:32.800> it's<00:02:32.920> not<00:02:33.070> nonstick

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
if this works I mean it's not nonstick

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.820 
if this works I mean it's not nonstick
but<00:02:34.270> for<00:02:34.480> an<00:02:34.570> aluminum<00:02:35.020> pan<00:02:35.260> maybe<00:02:35.590> it'll<00:02:35.800> work

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
but for an aluminum pan maybe it'll work

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.230 
but for an aluminum pan maybe it'll work
I<00:02:36.280> could<00:02:36.940> always<00:02:37.120> cut<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> handle<00:02:37.870> short<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:40.270> I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
I could always cut the handle short so I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.570 
I could always cut the handle short so I
did<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:43.420> test<00:02:43.690> before<00:02:44.370> earlier<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
did this test before earlier in the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.200 
did this test before earlier in the
month<00:02:45.820> using<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.050> boy<00:02:47.200> scout<00:02:47.590> pot<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.730> this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
month using the boy scout pot on this

month using the boy scout pot on this
ultralight<00:02:49.900> stove<00:02:50.290> stand<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> did

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
ultralight stove stand and what I did

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.600 
ultralight stove stand and what I did
was<00:02:55.320> started<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.440> burn<00:02:58.170> let<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.380> sit<00:02:59.710> for<00:02:59.740> 30

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
was started to burn let that sit for 30

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.020 
was started to burn let that sit for 30
seconds<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.830> get<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.220> speed<00:03:05.520> now<00:03:06.520> if<00:03:06.880> these

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
seconds to get up to speed now if these

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.720 
seconds to get up to speed now if these
things<00:03:07.090> work<00:03:07.570> I<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.830> an<00:03:08.950> idea<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.310> want<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.610> do

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
things work I have an idea I want to do

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.480 
things work I have an idea I want to do

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I'm hoping that this will work at least

yell pot but well one thing I forgot was
the<00:03:20.830> weight<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.850> rather<00:03:22.090> light<00:03:22.480> i'll<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.990> a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
the weight it's rather light i'll do a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.660 
the weight it's rather light i'll do a
weight<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.890> add<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.190> at<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.310> end<00:03:24.520> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
weight on this and add it at the end of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.740 
weight on this and add it at the end of
this<00:03:24.760> video<00:03:26.160> okay<00:03:27.160> there<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:28.140> 30<00:03:29.140> seconds

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
this video okay there we have 30 seconds

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.520 
this video okay there we have 30 seconds
temperature<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:31.870> at<00:03:32.050> 58<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:33.010> start<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.530> let's

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
temperature is at 58 to start and let's

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.040 
temperature is at 58 to start and let's
see<00:03:35.800> where<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.010> goes<00:03:36.360> here<00:03:37.360> we<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.780> 10

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
see where this goes here we have to 10

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:52.050 
see where this goes here we have to 10
to<00:03:38.470> 11<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:42.640> 12<00:03:43.000> at<00:03:43.270> six-forty<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:51.820> case

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to 11 to 12 at six-forty so in this case

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.290 
to 11 to 12 at six-forty so in this case
we<00:03:52.270> had<00:03:52.390> two<00:03:52.750> cups<00:03:52.960> of<00:03:53.110> water<00:03:53.350> starting<00:03:53.860> at<00:03:54.300> 58

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
we had two cups of water starting at 58

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.040 
we had two cups of water starting at 58
degrees<00:03:56.130> came<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.400> full<00:03:57.610> boil<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.150> 212<00:03:58.690> in

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
degrees came to a full boil of 212 in

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.900 
degrees came to a full boil of 212 in
six<00:04:00.010> minutes<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.550> 40<00:04:00.850> seconds<00:04:01.560> minus<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:03.610> 30

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
six minutes and 40 seconds minus the 30

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.650 
six minutes and 40 seconds minus the 30
seconds<00:04:04.740> makes<00:04:05.740> that<00:04:06.010> six<00:04:06.730> minutes<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.360> 10

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
seconds makes that six minutes and 10

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.240 
seconds makes that six minutes and 10
seconds<00:04:08.760> cool<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.210> other<00:04:10.900> tests<00:04:11.320> with<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.690 

Boy<00:04:15.250> Scout<00:04:15.580> pot<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:17.080> was<00:04:17.650> six<00:04:17.950> minutes<00:04:18.250> 51

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
Boy Scout pot it was six minutes 51

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.740 
Boy Scout pot it was six minutes 51
seconds<00:04:19.150> minus<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.720> 30<00:04:19.960> seconds<00:04:20.440> or<00:04:20.700> 621<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
seconds minus the 30 seconds or 621 so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.870 
seconds minus the 30 seconds or 621 so
it's<00:04:22.960> about<00:04:23.080> 10<00:04:23.860> seconds<00:04:24.370> give<00:04:24.550> or<00:04:24.580> take

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
it's about 10 seconds give or take

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.030 
it's about 10 seconds give or take
faster<00:04:25.680> cool<00:04:28.200> let<00:04:29.200> me<00:04:29.260> take<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.590> off<00:04:29.800> here

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
faster cool let me take this off here

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.890 
faster cool let me take this off here
and<00:04:30.580> like<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:30.730> said<00:04:30.880> it's<00:04:31.120> got<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.270> handles<00:04:31.750> now

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and like I said it's got a handles now

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.030 
and like I said it's got a handles now
it's<00:04:32.050> been<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.470> fire<00:04:32.710> all<00:04:32.920> this<00:04:33.100> time<00:04:35.040> the

handle is not hot to touch that's a plus

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.960 
handle is not hot to touch that's a plus
the<00:04:41.320> other<00:04:41.530> one

pot<00:05:18.080> weighs<00:05:19.240> 115<00:05:20.240> point<00:05:20.570> 9<00:05:20.840> grams<00:05:21.170> or<00:05:21.470> 4.1

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
pot weighs 115 point 9 grams or 4.1

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.880 
pot weighs 115 point 9 grams or 4.1
ounces<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.900> comes<00:05:24.140> out<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:26.320> 73<00:05:27.320> grams<00:05:27.500> or

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
ounces so that comes out to 73 grams or

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.270 
ounces so that comes out to 73 grams or
2.5<00:05:28.700> ounces<00:05:29.240> heavier<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.830> think<00:05:31.070> that's

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
2.5 ounces heavier and I think that's

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.870 
2.5 ounces heavier and I think that's
probably<00:05:31.520> because<00:05:31.970> of<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.360> handle<00:05:32.750> like<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
probably because of the handle like I

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.950 
probably because of the handle like I
said<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.180> other<00:05:35.210> plus<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.910> handle<00:05:38.360> forms

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
said the other plus is the handle forms

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.730 
said the other plus is the handle forms
a<00:05:39.110> clamp<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:40.580> use<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.060> rubber<00:05:41.360> seal<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:42.470> make

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
a clamp to use that rubber seal to make

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.060 
a clamp to use that rubber seal to make
this<00:05:42.920> I'm<00:05:43.130> sure<00:05:43.370> as<00:05:43.520> watertight<00:05:44.800> now<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.890> just

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
this I'm sure as watertight now you just

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.700 
this I'm sure as watertight now you just
might<00:05:46.280> want<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.640> take<00:05:46.820> some<00:05:47.260> other<00:05:48.260> kind<00:05:48.470> of<00:05:48.590> a

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
might want to take some other kind of a

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.440 
might want to take some other kind of a
band<00:05:48.980> to<00:05:49.220> put<00:05:49.430> around<00:05:49.610> this<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:50.090> make<00:05:50.270> sure

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
band to put around this to make sure

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.570 
band to put around this to make sure
that<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.720> does<00:05:50.900> stay<00:05:51.169> down<00:05:51.410> but<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.160> think<00:05:52.250> this

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
that it does stay down but I think this

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.930 
that it does stay down but I think this
will<00:05:52.730> be<00:05:52.790> a<00:05:52.910> handy<00:05:53.900> little<00:05:53.930> pot<00:05:54.760> for<00:05:55.760> those

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
will be a handy little pot for those

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.780 
will be a handy little pot for those
that<00:05:56.120> like<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.570> Billy<00:05:56.870> pots<00:05:58.990> okay<00:05:59.990> i<00:06:00.790> think

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
that like the Billy pots okay i think

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.610 
that like the Billy pots okay i think
i'm<00:06:02.030> going<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.240> put<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.419> my<00:06:03.080> idea<00:06:03.440> together

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
i'm going to put that my idea together

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.890 
i'm going to put that my idea together
here<00:06:04.130> and<00:06:04.190> i'll<00:06:04.280> make<00:06:04.400> another<00:06:04.550> video<00:06:04.940> in<00:06:05.300> a
