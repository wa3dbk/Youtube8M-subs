on Saturday um I think probably one of
my<00:01:31.380> favorite<00:01:31.829> workouts<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.310> he'll<00:01:32.520> work<00:01:32.840> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
my favorite workouts is he'll work just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.359 
my favorite workouts is he'll work just
being<00:01:34.140> able<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> kill<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
being able to go and kill it on the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.700 
being able to go and kill it on the
hills<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.320> hard<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
hills just you know go as hard as you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.120 
hills just you know go as hard as you
can<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.780> think<00:01:39.780> it'll<00:01:40.170> benefit<00:01:40.920> just

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
can and I think it'll benefit just

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.490 
can and I think it'll benefit just
because<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.479> second<00:01:43.049> Hill<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
because you know that second Hill on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
because you know that second Hill on
Balboa<00:01:43.890> park's<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:44.670> tough<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.240> hopefully

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
Balboa park's pretty tough so hopefully

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.789 
Balboa park's pretty tough so hopefully
I<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:47.119> do<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.299> damage<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> know

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
I can do some damage on it well I know

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649
