that<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.620> probably<00:00:04.980> should<00:00:05.279> have<00:00:05.310> done<00:00:05.490> way

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
that I probably should have done way

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.290 
that I probably should have done way
longer<00:00:06.870> ago<00:00:07.140> but<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.980> know<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.160> figured<00:00:08.700> better

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
longer ago but you know I figured better

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
longer ago but you know I figured better
later<00:00:09.660> than<00:00:09.929> ever<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.710> still<00:00:11.070> do<00:00:11.340> get<00:00:11.610> this

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
later than ever and I still do get this

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
later than ever and I still do get this
question<00:00:12.090> quite<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.660> bit<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.769> top<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
question quite a bit and on top of that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.160 
question quite a bit and on top of that
you<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> new<00:00:15.000> season<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:15.630> coming

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you know a new season is actually coming

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.980 
you know a new season is actually coming
in<00:00:16.590> case<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.949> guys<00:00:17.070> didn't<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.600> season<00:00:18.600> 15

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
in case you guys didn't know season 15

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
in case you guys didn't know season 15
is<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> way<00:00:19.619> before<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.310> next<00:00:20.910> expansion

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
is on the way before the next expansion

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
is on the way before the next expansion
before<00:00:21.689> warlords<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.500> Draenor<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.580> know<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
before warlords of Draenor so you know I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.029 
before warlords of Draenor so you know I
figured<00:00:24.240> well<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.470> time<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.920> this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
figured well if the right time for this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
figured well if the right time for this
video<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.580> best<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.300> figured<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
video is actually best I figured this is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
video is actually best I figured this is
going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> second<00:00:28.949> best<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:29.369> where<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to be the second best time where a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
going to be the second best time where a
new<00:00:30.480> season<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.199> start<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.859> people

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
new season is about to start so people

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
new season is about to start so people
are<00:00:32.489> probably<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are probably going to get in

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.319 
are probably going to get in
you<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.530> PvP<00:00:35.040> starting<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.149> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you know PvP starting over and all that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.450 
you know PvP starting over and all that
stuff<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.989> guess<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.980> pretty<00:00:38.280> good

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
stuff so I guess this is a pretty good

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.180 
stuff so I guess this is a pretty good
time<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.879> answer<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> question<00:00:39.570> which<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.710> as

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
time to answer this question which is as

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
time to answer this question which is as
a<00:00:41.250> warrior<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> course<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.870> should<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.200> use

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a warrior of course what should I use

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
a warrior of course what should I use
the<00:00:43.829> most<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.120> slam<00:00:45.480> or

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the most you know should I use slam or

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
the most you know should I use slam or
overpower<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.399> ones<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.149> which

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
overpower which ones in which

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.160 
overpower which ones in which
circumstances<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.170> probably

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
circumstances and one that I probably

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
circumstances and one that I probably
get<00:00:52.469> even<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> even<00:00:54.270> use

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
get even more which is do you even use

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
get even more which is do you even use
heroic<00:00:55.289> strike<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.949> worth<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
heroic strike is it worth using so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
heroic strike is it worth using so
that's<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that's pretty much what we're going to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130 
that's pretty much what we're going to
answer<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.730> video<00:01:00.090> starting<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.930> with

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
answer on this video starting off with

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
answer on this video starting off with
the<00:01:01.289> simple<00:01:01.590> question<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> should<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.059> slam

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the simple question of should I use slam

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
the simple question of should I use slam
or<00:01:03.660> overpowered<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.710> often<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.640> short<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
or overpowered more often in short the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
or overpowered more often in short the
answer<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.740> should<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> use

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
answer is you actually should try to use

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
answer is you actually should try to use
overpower<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.510> often<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.409> obviously<00:01:10.950> I'm

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
overpower more often but obviously I'm

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.550 
overpower more often but obviously I'm
going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> explain<00:01:11.880> why<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> before<00:01:13.350> going

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
going to explain why and before going

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
going to explain why and before going
into<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> say<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
into that I just want to say that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
into that I just want to say that
there's<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.780> math<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
there's going to be math on the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
there's going to be math on the
description<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.299> numbers<00:01:18.780> if

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
description with all these numbers if

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
description with all these numbers if
you<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.520> deep<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you want to really go deep on to this

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
you want to really go deep on to this
question<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> check<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
question you can go check it out on the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
question you can go check it out on the
description<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> maths<00:01:24.869> from

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
description with all the maths from

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
description with all the maths from
testings<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> other<00:01:26.340> sources<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.060> didn't

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
testings on other sources I didn't

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
testings on other sources I didn't
really<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> video

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
really want to put that on the video

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
really want to put that on the video
itself<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> doesn't<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.329> turn<00:01:30.600> into

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
itself so this doesn't really turn into

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.039 
itself so this doesn't really turn into
a<00:01:30.900> number<00:01:31.409> storm<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> simply<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> math<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a number storm and simply a math you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.560 
a number storm and simply a math you
know<00:01:34.200> video<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.610> being<00:01:35.820> said<00:01:35.909> let's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
know video and all that being said let's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
know video and all that being said let's
go<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> basics<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.189> know

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
go to the basics which are you know

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.630 
go to the basics which are you know
slammer<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:39.090> power<00:01:39.329> well<00:01:39.950> unarguably<00:01:40.950> slam

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
slammer over power well unarguably slam

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.240

you can use it faster than slam not only
that<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:09.179> also<00:02:09.379> decreases<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.410> cooldown<00:02:11.400> on

the mortal strike that

the mortal strike that
means<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.580> rage<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.409> if<00:02:16.620> you're

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
means more rage so you know if you're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890 
means more rage so you know if you're
going<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.250> use<00:02:17.400> mortal<00:02:17.970> strike<00:02:18.239> more<00:02:18.450> often

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
going to use mortal strike more often

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.930 
going to use mortal strike more often
that<00:02:19.319> obviously<00:02:19.799> means<00:02:20.099> more<00:02:20.370> rage<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.849> if

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that obviously means more rage and if

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.479 
that obviously means more rage and if
you<00:02:21.060> were<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.599> using<00:02:21.810> slam<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.980> only<00:02:23.250> deaths

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
you were just using slam not only deaths

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.789 
you were just using slam not only deaths
with<00:02:24.000> having<00:02:24.450> mortal<00:02:24.780> strike<00:02:25.080> more<00:02:25.349> often

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
with having mortal strike more often

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.740 
with having mortal strike more often
there's<00:02:26.040> also<00:02:26.370> more<00:02:26.849> chance<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.629> will

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
there's also more chance that you will

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.680 
there's also more chance that you will
get<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.409> enrage<00:02:28.950> Brock's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
get the enrage Brock's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.050 
get the enrage Brock's
also<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:31.379> top<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.099> over<00:02:32.819> power

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
also in top of all that over power

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.479 
also in top of all that over power
cannot<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.540> dodged<00:02:33.959> cannot<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.829> parried<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
cannot be dodged cannot be parried and

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.250 
cannot be dodged cannot be parried and
cannot<00:02:36.299> be<00:02:36.569> missed

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
cannot be missed

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.009 
cannot be missed
so<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.180> comes<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.599> sustained

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
so you know when it comes to sustained

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.020 
so you know when it comes to sustained
damage<00:02:40.379> over<00:02:40.739> power<00:02:40.950> does<00:02:41.310> win<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.879> it's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
damage over power does win it and it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.300 
damage over power does win it and it's
pretty<00:02:42.329> much<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:44.010> using

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
pretty much what do you want to be using

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.699 
pretty much what do you want to be using
more<00:02:44.700> often<00:02:45.299> especially<00:02:45.720> when<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> comes<00:02:46.500> to

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
more often especially when it comes to

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.710 
more often especially when it comes to
the<00:02:47.370> beginning<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> encounters<00:02:48.480> where

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the beginning of the encounters where

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.300 
the beginning of the encounters where
you<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.140> want<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.470> get<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.859> sustained

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
you really want to get your sustained

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640 
you really want to get your sustained
damage<00:02:50.760> rolling<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.349> being<00:02:52.560> said

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
damage rolling up so that being said

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.670 
damage rolling up so that being said
when<00:02:53.370> should<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.849> use<00:02:54.060> slam<00:02:54.390> well<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.470> said

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
when should I use slam well like I said

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.759 
when should I use slam well like I said
before<00:02:55.799> slam<00:02:56.609> arguably<00:02:57.480> hits<00:02:57.870> way<00:02:58.379> harder

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
before slam arguably hits way harder

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.160 
before slam arguably hits way harder
than<00:02:58.799> overpower<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.569> sectionally

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
than overpower so it's a sectionally

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
than overpower so it's a sectionally
good<00:03:01.409> when<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.799> need<00:03:02.099> that<00:03:02.370> instantaneous

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
good when you need that instantaneous

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.330 
good when you need that instantaneous
damage<00:03:03.599> it's<00:03:04.079> good<00:03:04.379> for<00:03:04.650> when<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.980> want<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
damage it's good for when you want to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.399 
damage it's good for when you want to
finish<00:03:05.700> off<00:03:05.879> opponents<00:03:06.480> where<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.049> need<00:03:07.230> is

finish off opponents where you need is

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
can do want to be using slam when it

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.420 
can do want to be using slam when it

from increased Christians wall slam does
not<00:03:24.810> obviously<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.709> cooldowns<00:03:26.130> increase

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
not obviously your cooldowns increase

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.390 
not obviously your cooldowns increase
the<00:03:27.150> chance<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.569> creating<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.500> slam<00:03:28.829> does<00:03:29.190> get

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the chance of creating so slam does get

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.270 
the chance of creating so slam does get
more<00:03:29.609> value<00:03:29.819> off<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.450> debt<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.470> bear<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.069> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
more value off of debt so bear that in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280 
more value off of debt so bear that in

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
starved a lot that's just because

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.670 
starved a lot that's just because
naturally<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.519> harder<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:04.109> naturally

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
should use it or something like that but

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.689 
should use it or something like that but

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
know you're on the global cooldown but

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.580 
know you're on the global cooldown but
you<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:33.570> want<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.780> kill<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:33.990> totem<00:05:34.320> so<00:05:34.530> you

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
you really want to kill the totem so you

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.410 
you really want to kill the totem so you
know<00:05:34.830> you're<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.100> heroics<00:05:35.670> right<00:05:35.910> totem

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.580 
know you're just heroics right totem
it's<00:05:36.810> pretty<00:05:37.050> much<00:05:37.230> one<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.740> only<00:05:38.040> usage<00:05:38.850> I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
it's pretty much one of the only usage I

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.710 
it's pretty much one of the only usage I
get<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:41.010> do<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.760> right<00:05:41.940> strike<00:05:42.240> pretty

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
get to do with the right strike pretty

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.500 
get to do with the right strike pretty
much<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.990> kill<00:05:43.170> totems<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.680> even<00:05:44.550> then<00:05:44.910> most

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
much to kill totems and even then most

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.960 
much to kill totems and even then most
of<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.870> times<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.620> really<00:05:47.130> say<00:05:47.310> most<00:05:47.670> most

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
of the times and I really say most most

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.730 
of the times and I really say most most
of<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.150> times<00:05:48.360> I'd<00:05:48.750> rather<00:05:49.050> wait<00:05:49.320> for<00:05:49.350> the

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
of the times I'd rather wait for the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.710 
of the times I'd rather wait for the
global<00:05:50.070> cooldown<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:51.150> know<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.510> do<00:05:51.600> it

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
global cooldown and you know just do it

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.780 
global cooldown and you know just do it
over<00:05:51.840> power<00:05:52.170> on<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.530> totem<00:05:52.890> or<00:05:52.980> something<00:05:53.430> you

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
over power on the totem or something you

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.830 
over power on the totem or something you
know<00:05:53.910> 30<00:05:54.390> rage<00:05:54.690> it's<00:05:54.990> just<00:05:56.000> way<00:05:57.000> enough<00:05:57.300> you

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
know 30 rage it's just way enough you

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.510 
know 30 rage it's just way enough you
can<00:05:58.020> say<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:58.470> you<00:05:58.620> know<00:05:58.680> Eric's<00:05:59.100> strike<00:05:59.340> can

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
can say that you know Eric's strike can

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.670 
can say that you know Eric's strike can
also<00:05:59.670> be<00:05:59.940> used<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.330> really<00:06:00.840> finish<00:06:01.110> off<00:06:01.410> you

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
also be used to really finish off you

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.920 
also be used to really finish off you
know<00:06:01.830> your<00:06:02.280> opponent's<00:06:02.940> let's<00:06:03.390> say<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.720> he

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
know your opponent's let's say that he

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.440 
know your opponent's let's say that he
is<00:06:03.990> very<00:06:04.230> very<00:06:04.380> low<00:06:04.770> health<00:06:05.070> and<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:06.330> know

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
is very very low health and you know

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.690 
is very very low health and you know
just<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:06.960> be<00:06:07.080> sure<00:06:07.110> you<00:06:07.470> throw<00:06:08.100> out<00:06:08.250> an<00:06:08.430> arroyo

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
just to be sure you throw out an arroyo

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.300 
just to be sure you throw out an arroyo
strike<00:06:09.120> on<00:06:09.330> top<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:09.930> another<00:06:10.170> ability<00:06:10.470> because

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
strike on top of another ability because

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.430 
strike on top of another ability because
it<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.760> on<00:06:12.000> global<00:06:12.360> kula<00:06:12.570> off<00:06:12.810> to<00:06:13.140> global

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
it is on global kula off to global

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.410 
it is on global kula off to global
cooldown<00:06:13.650> but<00:06:14.220> even<00:06:14.670> then<00:06:14.880> I<00:06:15.060> really<00:06:15.390> don't

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
cooldown but even then I really don't

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.950 
cooldown but even then I really don't
like<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.500> use<00:06:16.530> it<00:06:16.890> and<00:06:17.100> barely<00:06:17.730> ever<00:06:17.940> never<00:06:18.540> do

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
like to use it and barely ever never do

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.470 
like to use it and barely ever never do
no<00:06:19.740> that's<00:06:20.010> because<00:06:20.250> well<00:06:20.730> it's<00:06:21.030> just<00:06:21.270> too

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
no that's because well it's just too

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.950 
no that's because well it's just too
expensive<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.860> rather<00:06:23.130> just<00:06:23.430> wait<00:06:24.420> for<00:06:24.780> the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
expensive and I rather just wait for the

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.080 
expensive and I rather just wait for the
next<00:06:25.410> global<00:06:25.890> cooldown<00:06:26.070> so<00:06:26.280> I<00:06:26.580> can<00:06:26.880> definitely

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
next global cooldown so I can definitely

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.730 
next global cooldown so I can definitely
finish<00:06:27.480> off<00:06:27.690> with<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.020> slam<00:06:28.260> instead<00:06:28.620> of

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
finish off with the slam instead of

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.100 
finish off with the slam instead of
using<00:06:29.370> your<00:06:29.550> eye<00:06:29.760> strike<00:06:30.090> which<00:06:30.300> probably

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
using your eye strike which probably

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.160 
using your eye strike which probably
might<00:06:31.470> not<00:06:31.710> kill<00:06:32.010> it<00:06:32.160> and<00:06:32.340> then<00:06:32.660> next<00:06:33.660> global

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
might not kill it and then next global

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.520 
might not kill it and then next global
cooldown

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
cooldown

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.620 
cooldown
I<00:06:34.650> have<00:06:34.919> no<00:06:35.130> rage<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.760> actually<00:06:36.120> finish<00:06:36.390> it<00:06:36.419> off

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
I have no rage to actually finish it off

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.260 
I have no rage to actually finish it off
so<00:06:37.020> yeah<00:06:37.320> that's<00:06:37.770> pretty<00:06:37.919> much<00:06:38.190> erect<00:06:39.000> strike

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
so yeah that's pretty much erect strike

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.980 
so yeah that's pretty much erect strike
in<00:06:39.450> a<00:06:39.570> notch

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990
