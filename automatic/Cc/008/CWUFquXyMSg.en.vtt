their acrylic handle knives but what

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.229 
their acrylic handle knives but what
basically<00:03:02.250> let's<00:03:02.430> get<00:03:02.640> down<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> point

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
basically let's get down to the point

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.960 
basically let's get down to the point
what<00:03:03.480> happens<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:03.989> these<00:03:04.109> knives<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.970> if

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
what happens with these knives is if

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.039 
what happens with these knives is if
they're<00:03:06.180> treated<00:03:06.450> properly<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.959> don't

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
they're treated properly there you don't

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.690 
they're treated properly there you don't
see<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.290> lot<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.500> change<00:03:10.799> at<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:11.040> they'll<00:03:11.280> go

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
see a lot of change at all they'll go

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.210 
see a lot of change at all they'll go
for<00:03:11.910> 20-30<00:03:12.780> years<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:13.769> maybe<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
for 20-30 years but then maybe in a

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.330 
for 20-30 years but then maybe in a
period<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.879> week<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.410> may<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.620> what's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
period of a week you may see what's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.819 
period of a week you may see what's
called<00:03:17.549> gassing<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.239> where<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.470> handle

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
called gassing out where the handle

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.860 
called gassing out where the handle
material<00:03:19.919> starts<00:03:20.639> bubbling<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.540> actually

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
material starts bubbling and actually

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140 
material starts bubbling and actually
gas<00:03:22.139> will<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.829> released<00:03:23.310> from<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.940> material

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
gas will is released from this material

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.170 
gas will is released from this material
and<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.299> does<00:03:27.569> plays<00:03:28.560> havoc<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.190> steel<00:03:29.880> and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and and it does plays havoc on steel and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
and and it does plays havoc on steel and
it<00:03:30.599> will<00:03:30.750> tarnish<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.410> will<00:03:31.560> rust<00:03:31.859> your<00:03:32.130> steel

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
it will tarnish it will rust your steel

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.240 
it will tarnish it will rust your steel
something<00:03:33.329> serious<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.139> not<00:03:34.650> only<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.069> steel

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
something serious and not only the steel

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.460 
something serious and not only the steel

of the blade that it's the hell material

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.830 
of the blade that it's the hell material
is<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.340> knives<00:03:38.579> surrounding<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.599> or

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
in the same collection so they're

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.409 
in the same collection so they're
actually<00:03:42.930> somewhat<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.889> time<00:03:44.160> bomb<00:03:44.459> waiting

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
kind of a sign that this might be

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
kind of a sign that this might be
happening<00:03:58.139> you'll<00:03:58.680> see<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:59.010> where<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.819> hamlet

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
happening you'll see it where the hamlet

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.580 
happening you'll see it where the hamlet
Tyrael<00:04:00.450> next<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> bolster<00:04:01.169> will<00:04:01.319> actually

Tyrael next to the bolster will actually

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.460 
Tyrael next to the bolster will actually
start<00:04:01.769> shrinking<00:04:02.099> up<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:03.930> always<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
start shrinking up it's not always the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.159 
start shrinking up it's not always the
case<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:08.150> sometimes<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.780> older

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
case but and sometimes it's the older

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.559 
case but and sometimes it's the older
celluloid<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.949> are<00:04:11.190> more<00:04:11.639> susceptible<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.329> it

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
celluloid you are more susceptible to it

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.439 
celluloid you are more susceptible to it
but<00:04:12.720> I've<00:04:12.840> had<00:04:13.019> some<00:04:13.260> knives<00:04:14.030> made<00:04:15.030> by<00:04:15.209> case

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
but I've had some knives made by case

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.140 
but I've had some knives made by case
cutlery<00:04:15.870> actually<00:04:16.530> made<00:04:17.310> by<00:04:17.459> Queen<00:04:17.760> cutlery

but<00:04:18.389> were<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.660> case<00:04:18.840> classics<00:04:19.849> some

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
but were the case classics some

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.080 
but were the case classics some
beautiful<00:04:21.329> candy<00:04:21.780> candy<00:04:22.650> stripe<00:04:23.090> celluloid

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
beautiful candy candy stripe celluloid

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.080 
beautiful candy candy stripe celluloid
and<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:26.010> could<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.640> could

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and I could I could

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.420 
and I could I could
see<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.480> was<00:04:27.600> starting<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.220> release<00:04:29.220> some

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
see that it was starting to release some

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.710 
see that it was starting to release some
guess<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.699> was<00:04:29.790> nothing<00:04:30.090> horrible<00:04:30.270> IV<00:04:30.480> if<00:04:30.630> you

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
guess it was nothing horrible IV if you

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.000 
guess it was nothing horrible IV if you
go<00:04:30.840> on<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.230> Google<00:04:31.949> you'll<00:04:32.130> see<00:04:32.340> some<00:04:32.610> really
