about them cool so we just launched
three<00:00:21.189> printers<00:00:21.489> but<00:00:21.730> actually<00:00:22.090> it's

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
three printers but actually it's

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.280 
three printers but actually it's
interesting<00:00:22.390> it's<00:00:22.630> really<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.900> MakerBot<00:00:23.259> 3d

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290

printing platform they all have the same
electronics<00:00:25.450> inside<00:00:25.750> they're<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.649> same

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
electronics inside they're the same

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.979 
electronics inside they're the same
software<00:00:27.220> behind<00:00:27.610> them<00:00:27.790> each<00:00:28.419> of<00:00:28.689> them<00:00:28.810> has<00:00:28.960> a

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
software behind them each of them has a

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.720 
software behind them each of them has a
smart<00:00:29.380> extruder<00:00:29.590> which<00:00:29.829> can<00:00:30.250> message<00:00:30.460> you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
smart extruder which can message you

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.670 
smart extruder which can message you
when<00:00:30.939> you<00:00:31.090> need<00:00:31.239> to<00:00:31.329> add<00:00:31.450> more<00:00:31.630> filament<00:00:32.140> each

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
when you need to add more filament each

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.229 
when you need to add more filament each
of<00:00:32.890> them<00:00:32.980> have<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.220> camera<00:00:33.520> on<00:00:33.760> them<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.149> that

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
of them have a camera on them so that

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.990 
of them have a camera on them so that
you<00:00:34.480> can<00:00:34.690> monitor<00:00:35.380> your<00:00:35.530> PIN<00:00:35.739> progress<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.550> it

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
you can monitor your PIN progress and it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.939 
you can monitor your PIN progress and it
also<00:00:37.210> like<00:00:37.570> make<00:00:38.019> it<00:00:38.140> easy<00:00:38.289> to<00:00:38.500> share<00:00:38.530> your

also like make it easy to share your

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.950 
also like make it easy to share your

latest creation on social networks this

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.029 
latest creation on social networks this
will<00:00:41.109> be<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.260> little<00:00:41.379> bit<00:00:41.500> more<00:00:41.710> about<00:00:41.859> the

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
will be a little bit more about the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.160 
will be a little bit more about the
camera<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:42.609> monitor<00:00:42.699> your<00:00:43.000> parents<00:00:43.570> how<00:00:43.899> does

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
camera and monitor your parents how does

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.700 
camera and monitor your parents how does
that<00:00:44.289> work<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.420> all<00:00:46.839> of<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.199> 3d<00:00:47.440> printers

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
that work so the all of the 3d printers

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.810 
that work so the all of the 3d printers
are<00:00:47.829> all<00:00:47.890> network<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.460> they<00:00:48.579> all<00:00:48.670> have

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
are all network so they all have

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.119 
are all network so they all have
wireless<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.600> our<00:00:49.780> network<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:50.890> can

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
wireless and our network so you can

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.700 
wireless and our network so you can
connect<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.579> them<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:53.109> whole<00:00:53.230> idea<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.589> to

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
connect to them and the whole idea is to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.560 
connect to them and the whole idea is to
make<00:00:53.769> it<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.190> you're<00:00:54.879> always<00:00:55.059> connected

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
make it so you you're always connected

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.529 
make it so you you're always connected
to<00:00:55.929> your<00:00:56.050> MakerBot<00:00:56.350> 3d<00:00:56.499> printer<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.539> it's

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
to your MakerBot 3d printer and it's

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.119 
to your MakerBot 3d printer and it's
that<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.899> pull<00:00:59.079> up<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.499> owe<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.679> get<00:01:00.010> you

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
that you pull up it you owe you get you

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.950 
that you pull up it you owe you get you
download<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.550> maker<00:01:00.699> about<00:01:00.909> application<00:01:01.659> for

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.090 
your phone and then you just open it up
and<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.360> can<00:01:04.390> see<00:01:05.290> what<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.590> see<00:01:05.950> the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
and you can see what you see the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.440 
and you can see what you see the
progress<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.550> where<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:06.909> right<00:01:07.090> now<00:01:07.150> no

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
a little bit about each of these models

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.149 
a little bit about each of these models
what<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.909> differences<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.390> sure<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.979> many

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
what the differences are sure so in many

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.130 
what the differences are sure so in many
ways<00:01:18.280> they're<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.060> same<00:01:19.299> machine<00:01:19.750> just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
ways they're the same machine just

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.020 
ways they're the same machine just
different<00:01:20.469> sizes<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.520> are<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.670> few<00:01:21.820> features

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
right now I do and you know the sci-fi

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.569 
right now I do and you know the sci-fi
prop<00:02:55.459> makers<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.239> prop<00:02:56.450> makers<00:02:57.130> they're<00:02:58.130> like

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
prop makers the prop makers they're like

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.520 
prop makers the prop makers they're like
over<00:02:59.209> them

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
over them

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.680

so get a big response from them yeah and
you<00:03:01.900> know<00:03:02.020> it's<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.590> one<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:02.920> those<00:03:03.010> things

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
you know it's it's one of those things

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.130 
you know it's it's one of those things
where<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.940> know<00:03:03.970> we<00:03:04.090> originally<00:03:04.540> started<00:03:04.630> and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
where you know we originally started and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.540 
where you know we originally started and
we<00:03:05.200> made<00:03:05.410> 3d<00:03:05.770> printers<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.190> were<00:03:06.280> kids

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
we made 3d printers that were kids

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.940 
we made 3d printers that were kids
primarily<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> hobbyist<00:03:08.080> then<00:03:08.709> last

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
primarily for the hobbyist then last

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
primarily for the hobbyist then last
year<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.280> were<00:03:09.370> focused<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:09.940> prosumer<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
year we were focused on the prosumer and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.900 
year we were focused on the prosumer and
now<00:03:11.290> we're<00:03:11.800> just<00:03:12.069> not<00:03:12.190> messing<00:03:12.400> around<00:03:12.550> we're

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
now we're just not messing around we're

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.970 
now we're just not messing around we're
making<00:03:13.180> 3d<00:03:13.360> printers<00:03:13.690> for<00:03:13.840> everyone<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
making 3d printers for everyone and the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.199 
making 3d printers for everyone and the
whole<00:03:15.130> idea<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.550> unlock<00:03:15.700> people's

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
whole idea is to unlock people's
