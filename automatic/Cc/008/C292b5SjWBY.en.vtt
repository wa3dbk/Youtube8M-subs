he<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.570> kind<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.690> absorb<00:02:32.260> his<00:02:32.410> own<00:02:32.530> feedback

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
he can kind of absorb his own feedback

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.740 
he can kind of absorb his own feedback
I'm<00:02:33.220> sure<00:02:33.400> he's<00:02:33.550> happy<00:02:33.790> listening<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.390> people

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
I'm sure he's happy listening to people

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.229 
I'm sure he's happy listening to people
who<00:02:34.900> were<00:02:34.930> riding<00:02:35.530> his<00:02:35.620> boards<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.239> he's

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
who were riding his boards and he's

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.420 
who were riding his boards and he's
absorbing<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> feedback<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:38.560> them<00:02:38.830> but<00:02:39.160> I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
absorbing the feedback from them but I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.850 
absorbing the feedback from them but I
think<00:02:40.060> what's<00:02:40.330> really<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.380> you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
think what's really going on is that you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.330 
think what's really going on is that you
know<00:02:41.980> dave<00:02:42.340> has<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.640> vision<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:44.340> these

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
know dave has a vision about these

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.729 
know dave has a vision about these
boards<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:46.959> he's<00:02:47.290> shaking

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
boards and you know I think he's shaking

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
complicated deck David actually sent me

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.950 
complicated deck David actually sent me
an<00:03:14.280> email<00:03:14.370> while<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.690> think<00:03:15.720> he

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
an email while back and I think he

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.530 
an email while back and I think he
actually<00:03:15.990> sent<00:03:16.500> me<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.650> photo<00:03:17.390> one<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
actually sent me a photo one of the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.090 
actually sent me a photo one of the
first<00:03:18.810> ones<00:03:19.050> had<00:03:19.230> done<00:03:19.440> he<00:03:19.650> said<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> was

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
first ones had done he said it was

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.130 
first ones had done he said it was
experimenting<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:20.910> concave<00:03:21.390> decks<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.020> it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
experimenting with concave decks and it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.050 
experimenting with concave decks and it
was<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:23.010> sort<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.280> hard<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.580> see<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.910> properly

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
was but sort of hard to see it properly

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.640 
was but sort of hard to see it properly
in<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.360> photo<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.960> was<00:03:25.110> hard<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.410> actually

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
in the photo it was hard to actually

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.060 
in the photo it was hard to actually
visualize<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:26.910> when<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.960> when<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.830> saw

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
visualize it but when I on when I saw

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.950 
visualize it but when I on when I saw
the<00:03:29.130> first<00:03:29.460> demo<00:03:29.760> models<00:03:30.240> I<00:03:30.390> was<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:30.690> really

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
the first demo models I was like really

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.750 
the first demo models I was like really
excited<00:03:31.560> about<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.920> because<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:32.400> only<00:03:32.430> does

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
excited about it because not only does

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.670 
excited about it because not only does
it<00:03:32.820> look<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.660> cool<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.140> bored<00:03:34.440> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
it look like really cool and bored and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.550 
it look like really cool and bored and
sort<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.460> look<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:35.880> racy<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.990> arm<00:03:37.170> you

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
sort of look really racy the arm you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
sort of look really racy the arm you
know<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.800> design<00:03:38.100> theory<00:03:38.460> behind<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.970> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
know the design theory behind it is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.180 
know the design theory behind it is
great<00:03:39.360> because<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.870> actually<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.070> it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
great because it actually you know it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.640 
great because it actually you know it
feels<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.170> deck<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
feels like you down in the deck of the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.160 
feels like you down in the deck of the
board<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.790> feels<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.510> board<00:03:45.780> is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
board and it feels like the board is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.650 
board and it feels like the board is
actually<00:03:46.740> thinner<00:03:47.220> than<00:03:47.940> what<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.390> because

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
actually thinner than what it is because

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.450 
actually thinner than what it is because
the<00:03:48.930> B<00:03:49.080> section<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> rail<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.040> thicker<00:03:50.310> and

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
the B section of the rail is thicker and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.060 
the B section of the rail is thicker and
this<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.880> sort<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.150> concave<00:03:51.570> down<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.860> feels

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
this is sort of concave down so it feels

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
this is sort of concave down so it feels
like<00:03:53.310> you're<00:03:53.460> kind<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.820> like<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.270> know<00:03:54.300> right

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
like you're kind of like you know right

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.450 
like you're kind of like you know right
down<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> board<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:55.980> you've<00:03:56.100> got<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> lot

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
down in the board and you've got a lot

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.430 
down in the board and you've got a lot
more<00:03:56.490> feeling<00:03:57.150> from<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:58.020> kind<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.290> like

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
more feeling from it it's kind of like

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.500 
more feeling from it it's kind of like
on<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.710> goddess<00:03:59.610> theory<00:03:59.880> when<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> normal

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
on a goddess theory when a normal

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.530 
on a goddess theory when a normal
surfboard<00:04:01.020> but<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.520> they<00:04:02.520> age<00:04:02.850> they<00:04:03.360> actually

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
surfboard but as they age they actually

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.260 
surfboard but as they age they actually
go<00:04:04.200> better<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:05.220> what<00:04:05.400> happens<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.940> when

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
go better because what happens is when

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.610 
go better because what happens is when
you<00:04:06.390> get<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> brand<00:04:06.810> new<00:04:06.960> board<00:04:07.200> there's<00:04:07.470> no

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
you get a brand new board there's no

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.380 
you get a brand new board there's no
footprints<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.460> and<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> normal

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
surfboard with glassing as your writer

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.100

for<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> while<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.060> starts<00:04:12.390> you're<00:04:12.480> really<00:04:12.780> dent

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
for a while it starts you're really dent

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.200 
for a while it starts you're really dent
up<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.590> deck<00:04:13.830> starts<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.370> become<00:04:14.520> concave

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
up and the deck starts to become concave

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.780 
up and the deck starts to become concave
and<00:04:15.990> when<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.290> becomes<00:04:16.560> clunker<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.340> phils<00:04:17.580> is

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
and when it becomes clunker the phils is

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.880 
and when it becomes clunker the phils is

the board feels really sensitive and it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:50.740 
the board feels really sensitive and it
feels<00:04:41.790> as<00:04:41.940> though<00:04:42.090> it's<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:42.870> been<00:04:43.170> worn<00:04:43.500> in

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.380 

I<00:04:50.900> got<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.010> excited<00:04:52.040> about<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.820> new<00:04:52.970> range<00:04:53.210> of

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
I got so excited about the new range of

I got so excited about the new range of

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
subject as the 93 and the 96 that I

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.720 
subject as the 93 and the 96 that I
actually<00:04:56.960> gave<00:04:57.290> date<00:04:57.620> I'm<00:04:57.860> gonna<00:04:58.010> call<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.550> see

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
actually gave date I'm gonna call to see

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.620 
actually gave date I'm gonna call to see
if<00:04:58.760> he<00:04:59.000> could<00:04:59.150> make<00:04:59.360> me<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.570> custom<00:05:00.110> eps<00:05:01.270> 94<00:05:02.270> sort

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
time I got flying off the board so I've

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.650 
time I got flying off the board so I've
got<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:42.860> theory<00:05:43.160> that<00:05:43.430> in<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.090> conditions

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
got this theory that in the conditions

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.380 
got this theory that in the conditions
that<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.930> actually<00:05:45.110> use<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.770> board<00:05:46.040> in<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:47.000> if

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
that I actually use the board in that if

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.480 
that I actually use the board in that if
you<00:05:47.630> could<00:05:47.900> get<00:05:48.230> one<00:05:48.440> that<00:05:48.650> was<00:05:48.800> super<00:05:49.280> super

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
you could get one that was super super

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.570 
you could get one that was super super
light<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.810> would<00:05:51.350> be<00:05:51.530> really<00:05:51.980> good<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
light that would be really good in the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.760 
light that would be really good in the
small<00:05:52.940> sort<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.420> sloppy<00:05:53.720> surface<00:05:54.230> i<00:05:54.320> righted

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
small sort of sloppy surface i righted

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.830 
small sort of sloppy surface i righted
and<00:05:54.890> up<00:05:55.010> with<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.310> lightness<00:05:55.790> would<00:05:56.150> add<00:05:56.630> to

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
and up with the lightness would add to

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.290 
and up with the lightness would add to
the<00:05:57.290> responsiveness<00:05:57.950> that<00:05:58.160> Dave<00:05:58.610> is<00:05:58.640> actually

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
the responsiveness that Dave is actually

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.960 
the responsiveness that Dave is actually
built<00:05:59.570> into<00:05:59.900> these<00:06:00.050> subjective<00:06:00.770> shapes<00:06:01.040> so

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
built into these subjective shapes so

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.810 
built into these subjective shapes so
I'm<00:06:02.270> pretty<00:06:02.450> excited<00:06:02.570> to<00:06:03.140> try<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:04.070> really

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
I'm pretty excited to try it I really

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.300 
I'm pretty excited to try it I really
think<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.150> it's<00:06:05.390> going<00:06:05.540> to<00:06:05.630> feel<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:05.960> a

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
think that it's going to feel like a

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.380 
think that it's going to feel like a
high-performance<00:06:07.310> surfboard<00:06:07.520> because<00:06:08.180> in

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
high-performance surfboard because in

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.810 
high-performance surfboard because in
normal<00:06:09.200> surfboard<00:06:09.680> production<00:06:10.190> most<00:06:10.580> of<00:06:10.730> the

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
normal surfboard production most of the

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.640 
normal surfboard production most of the
boards<00:06:11.120> when<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.360> walk<00:06:11.540> into<00:06:11.720> a<00:06:11.840> shop<00:06:12.080> are<00:06:12.530> all

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
boards when you walk into a shop are all

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.490 
boards when you walk into a shop are all
blast<00:06:12.980> lots<00:06:13.880> the<00:06:14.240> glass<00:06:14.450> reasonably<00:06:15.020> strongly

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
blast lots the glass reasonably strongly

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.990 
blast lots the glass reasonably strongly
so<00:06:15.710> there's<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.920> certain<00:06:16.160> amount<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.550> weight<00:06:16.790> in

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
so there's a certain amount of weight in

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.690 
so there's a certain amount of weight in
them<00:06:17.210> which<00:06:17.840> deadens<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.380> performance<00:06:19.040> if

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
them which deadens the performance if

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.310 
them which deadens the performance if
you<00:06:19.910> get<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.150> high-performance<00:06:21.110> surfboard

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
you get a high-performance surfboard

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.610 
you get a high-performance surfboard
blasting<00:06:22.250> 4-ounce<00:06:22.730> without

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
blasting 4-ounce without

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.100 
blasting 4-ounce without
perhaps<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.520> board<00:06:24.790> think<00:06:25.030> lighter<00:06:25.330> this

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
perhaps the board think lighter this

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.140 
perhaps the board think lighter this
feels<00:06:26.380> faster<00:06:26.949> and<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:27.160> feels<00:06:27.370> more<00:06:27.580> lively

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
feels faster and it feels more lively

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.540 
feels faster and it feels more lively
and<00:06:28.180> easier<00:06:28.600> to<00:06:28.750> turn<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.740> I'm<00:06:30.040> kind<00:06:30.280> of<00:06:30.340> like

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
and easier to turn so I'm kind of like

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.310 
and easier to turn so I'm kind of like
super<00:06:31.000> excited<00:06:31.449> about<00:06:31.600> this<00:06:31.750> one<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.139> dave

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
super excited about this one that dave

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.310 
super excited about this one that dave
is<00:06:32.560> doing<00:06:32.590> calming<00:06:33.160> now<00:06:33.340> because<00:06:33.790> I<00:06:34.540> spoke<00:06:35.050> to

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
darkening and as light as possible so i

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.610 
darkening and as light as possible so i
think<00:06:39.790> it's<00:06:40.150> going<00:06:40.330> to<00:06:40.389> be<00:06:40.600> i<00:06:40.960> know<00:06:41.199> it's<00:06:41.500> going

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
think it's going to be i know it's going

think it's going to be i know it's going
to<00:06:41.680> go<00:06:41.889> good<00:06:42.130> because<00:06:42.490> it's<00:06:42.669> a<00:06:42.760> subject<00:06:43.240> ER<00:06:43.389> but

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
to go good because it's a subject ER but

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.719 
to go good because it's a subject ER but
i<00:06:44.169> think<00:06:44.440> it's<00:06:44.560> going<00:06:44.680> to<00:06:44.740> go<00:06:44.830> even<00:06:45.520> better

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
i think it's going to go even better

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.100 
i think it's going to go even better
again<00:06:46.180> and<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:46.419> boards<00:06:46.720> that<00:06:46.810> i've<00:06:46.930> been

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
again and the boards that i've been

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.290 
again and the boards that i've been
writing<00:06:47.520> because<00:06:48.520> of<00:06:48.639> the<00:06:48.699> weight<00:06:48.910> i<00:06:48.940> think

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
writing because of the weight i think

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.510 
writing because of the weight i think
it's<00:06:49.419> going<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:49.600> be<00:06:49.690> great<00:06:49.840> in<00:06:50.139> the<00:06:50.320> small<00:06:51.250> surf
