00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.719
 hi friends 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.129
 here I am in this bet today that is going 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.130
 to be masses of pork fried to glory 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.960
 they have clarified to me that to the creole well I 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.789
 I understand by the Greek brigades if it is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.730
 that it was not with oil but with the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.060
 same pig fat 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 well here I have some pork fat 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.550
 greaves that were made 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.660
 you see the little bubbles 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.870
 that make up the fat to be good already have 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.870
 opposite 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.840
 wow I put it in a fire that more or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.720
 least I think it's medium plus or minus 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.900
 I think it's medium then now 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.140
 I'm going to show the meat 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.770
 the meat of course 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.050
 come in bigger pieces but I the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.030
 I was dividing 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.100
 he was dividing it in that for Carlos 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.830
 it's very big pre finitas 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.939
 because if you leave some clubs with 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 very large during cooking 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.159
 cook then to cook for 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.960
 inside you will be very burned by 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.640
 out then let's put already the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.780
 wash the divide the wash the drain and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.110
 laws maybe now I'm going to put them in 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.110
 the fat 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.110
 practically cold 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.860
 and visit nothing else really that has 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.860
 some delicious 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.539
 and give it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.990
 let's fry our masses 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.990
 as follows 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.750
 more or less if the fire rushes me 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.750
 I'm going to lower it 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.190
 I have created special conditions for 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 this video 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.310
 because he did not manage to put on the table 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.020
 the kitchen with stature 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.560
 well then you see 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.080
 that is not like that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.080
 this is water 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.890
 because cuba 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.230
 water that covers 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.330
 come without frying water that covers 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.549
 we match well 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.760
 and we're going to leave we will leave 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.820
 cook in that medium fire then 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 I'm going to cover it halfway and I'm going to 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.930
 observe and I recommend that you 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:32.170
 Do the same when you put the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.750
 masses with water will not overflow 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.239
 and well let's keep watching 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.360
 because the point is to cook with the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.730
 water, reduce the water and stay in the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 fat then that fry in the fat 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.420
 good gentlemen 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.420
 let's see how it's already frying 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.269
 I said I had to pour more water 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.360
 because when you clean it with a fork 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.430
 there are still some hard ones you are already 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.430
 let's give it priority and put them 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.050
 then now it comes 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.080
 the main tonic 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.900
 see you 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.410
 2 cloves garlic crushed 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.930
 that now I put them 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.440
 I put her so she can take that 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.440
 flavor 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.240
 tasty that gives people 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.040
 we see 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.090
 now that gives matronic to a 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.090
 Rich rich exquisite 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.260
 that is, if you are low on the lake and 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.800
 when it is in this final process that 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.800
 it's already frying 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.120
 so 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.449
 so that the garlic does not burn and bitter 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.930
 look, come and look like this for me 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.100
 enough 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.100
 I do not like it anymore 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:40.690
 good friends, I'm going to finish them 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:42.780
 see the color which have already from 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.969
 there they start 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.789
 dry out in total whether you like it 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.080
 do it so continue and I give for 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.080
 finished this process
