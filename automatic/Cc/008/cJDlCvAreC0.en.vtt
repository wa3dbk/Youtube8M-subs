three<00:02:33.269> cooked<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.620> texture<00:02:34.980> itself<00:02:35.549> I

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
three cooked so the texture itself I

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.240 
three cooked so the texture itself I
also<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.989> bit<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:38.069> it's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250

yeah because when it's not to cook you
could<00:02:42.480> still<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.290> vitamins<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.069> think

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
could still all the vitamins I think

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.270 
could still all the vitamins I think
this<00:02:45.299> one<00:02:45.540> was<00:02:45.720> better<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.470> more<00:02:46.950> taste

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
this one was better because more taste

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.699 
this one was better because more taste
and<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.849> maybe<00:02:48.120> good<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.079> beans<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and it's maybe good of the beans and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.500 
and it's maybe good of the beans and
there<00:02:49.859> is<00:02:49.950> more<00:02:50.159> different<00:02:50.609> days<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:50.879> maybe

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
there is more different days and maybe

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
there is more different days and maybe
it's<00:02:51.659> more<00:02:51.870> sophisticated<00:02:52.019> than<00:02:53.010> this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
it's more sophisticated than this

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
it's more sophisticated than this
because<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.739> think<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.310> soya<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.480> vinegar

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
because I think the soya and the vinegar

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.979 
because I think the soya and the vinegar
are<00:02:58.170> too<00:02:58.530> strong<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.060> the<00:03:00.060> leaf<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
are too strong for the leaf and the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
are too strong for the leaf and the
steam<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.500> Hong<00:03:02.430> Kong<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.540> maybe<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.980> might<00:03:05.189> be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
steam of Hong Kong so maybe it might be

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
steam of Hong Kong so maybe it might be
a<00:03:05.459> bit<00:03:05.730> plank<00:03:06.030> less<00:03:06.480> strong<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.709> enjoy<00:03:08.010> more

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
a bit plank less strong to enjoy more

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.479 
a bit plank less strong to enjoy more
and<00:03:08.730> maybe<00:03:09.030> less<00:03:09.329> cook<00:03:09.599> but<00:03:10.349> this<00:03:10.920> dish<00:03:11.220> was

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489
