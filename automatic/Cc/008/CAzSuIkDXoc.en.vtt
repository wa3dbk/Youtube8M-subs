00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
with a cleaning cloth which I love

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.219 
with a cleaning cloth which I love
because<00:01:01.739> glasses<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.149> dirty<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.989> very

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
because glasses do get dirty very very

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.520 
because glasses do get dirty very very
easily<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.979> found<00:01:05.790> their<00:01:06.119> website<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.930> easy<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
easily I found their website so easy to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
easily I found their website so easy to
navigate<00:01:07.650> around<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.119> slightly

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
navigate around and I was slightly

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170 
navigate around and I was slightly
skeptical<00:01:10.340> about<00:01:11.340> whether<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:12.030> would

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
skeptical about whether they would

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.539 
skeptical about whether they would
actually<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.200> prescription<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:14.159> and

actually get my prescription right and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
actually get my prescription right and
whether<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.350> able<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
whether I would actually be able to see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
whether I would actually be able to see
out<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.119> soon<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:18.659> them<00:01:18.780> on

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
