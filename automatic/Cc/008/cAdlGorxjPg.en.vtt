00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 the notion of pve so who pve customers 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 I see we will not not be 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.070
 today we are just going 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
 explain a little bit of news 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 about the customer is pretty good 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 things like that here is champion my 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.740
 story so in the next list then 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.600
 nothing has changed except for this little 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.720
 button to add a friend now on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.150
 can add through facebook you do not 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 too much how was it going for a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.679
 pasco tomb I believe I can try 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 to think not to piss me off that but 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.890
 good to add through facebook will be 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 why not I was like that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.340
 added a friend must put the nickname 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.070
 test separation ok here it's not there 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.770
 ok so that's the way it all 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.079
 to always make groups for 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.120
 to make groups 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.460
 yeah so hey that's not it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 interesting is especially so here is 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.989
 so then the little interface of the profile 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.760
 has been redone 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.350
 we see that now we have a top 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 champions a top champions and the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 banks and glacis dominion and g 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 on this side we were able to title arrow of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 blow then into a small island 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.990
 drop-down one can click like his 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170
 branch blow that setting up and the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 better better shot done 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.570
 good after that is obvious because 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.740
 of course I'm leather the sphere 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.299
 the beta 1 I played four axes for 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.380
 show a little how 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.369
 do besides atrox that's going to be a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.960
 little do you go the ox 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.150
 how do you how do you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 show what so master i score 1 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.530
 ok so basically I once mounted my 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.500
 champion I have a score of 1 1 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 we can tanger 4 auxerre l1 so he 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.960
 is at 800 was so I won a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.939
 vision x-plane game i did 1 1 ten to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.250
 twenty four have good tutorial well played I 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.759
 had the drama more so not scratching them 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.299
 abcd i believe in big bones this is the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 better it means great or something 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.170
 of the kind ah bah that means it's 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.759
 well down well end is not so good 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 but that's good it's about 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.740
 well helped it's a bit bad so better 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.340
 grade c is that for that you do a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.680
 good game was suddenly I'm 24 so 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.150
 very nice game so top champions on 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.910
 will therefore have three champion rate three 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.290
 wholesale mails with a badge a match that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.450
 evolves there are several thirds there must there 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.580
 to have five thirds one sees besides the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.069
 standing here now three different grades 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.569
 boots his best grades based 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.520
 the ranks we have we will have 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.810
 rewards for a champion I believe 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.099
 that after the game we will have the little ball at 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.480
 above the head I'm too much I do not 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.640
 too stupid it was flush with 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.530
 small rewards anyway there was 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.569
 of the top eight champions in progress in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.050
 so here's progress up to 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.650
 1800 to spend the beautiful 2 will see them 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.150
 so it's freighter fighters so the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.540
 league champions if they were put to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.709
 day we see the little rank that I have 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.440
 played that barter so that's normal that 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.780
 I only have this patch next patch 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.830
 you will have nothing at all because that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.980
 will be considered if you do not 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.310
 never had a champion at wholesale 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.110
 we will want to replay if not at the level of 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.069
 the end of the party the late part to his 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.170
 hosts he was also a little bit 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.819
 improved country level wins and all that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.290
 we throw in has been improved so we are 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.970
 this is the party history that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.549
 I had presented one more time 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.110
 that she still has not been put into play 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.250
 on the live here is he said wak two 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.650
 parties for those who had not seen my 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.640
 last video on I do not know too much 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.470
 if it is improved I do not think so 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.440
 ok when we can move the mav there I 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 think it's a bug at home almost 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.819
 not terrible on the pair like that see 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.680
 not recover it li rafik coughed him all 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:46.220
 level wheels a mastery allart has been 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.859
 modified so to the big maj of the pad 5.6 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.940
 by the big novelty it's going to be 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.959
 champion tourist masses that the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.239
 champion metrics my buy button 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.849
 a friend here's changes had to 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.650
 war for those who love jovillard 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.569
 veillard had rather very well europe 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.670
 he has already been a people on the 1.5 patch 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.010
 but it will be very very brief a very 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.000
 very well beef at the level of the run I 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.319
 then and then I do not know what but I 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.150
 believe that the cloud will do with a 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.789
 little bit better run I took the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.859
 least change also in any case 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.910
 it's going to be a lot better a lot of 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.139
 movies are out so we're going to watch 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.860
 it goes to not images but basically 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.250
 there is a skin for nasus to tell him 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.599
 soraka enami and mu even had a small 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.740
 man shaped two wells what what 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.160
 I do not know if I do not think so 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.820
 now it's a new one it's a 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.970
 little new leap has not unlocked 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.970
 his 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.590
 I think good we toured was 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.360
 give him a tour of the little novelties 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.150
 ah yes also the map that will not it is 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.970
 he'll fight just be 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.070
 removed from the beta mode people tell me he 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.490
 will switch to normal mode 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.290
 mode mode ended for now are 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.190
 still in beta but stops 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.190
 definitely removed had so much in 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.060
 terminal phase of terminale repeat of the 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.430
 blow to the map is still a lot 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.200
 most beautiful the company if I am at a 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.210
