on<00:01:50.700> even<00:01:51.700> MKV<00:01:52.270> which<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.570> was<00:01:52.659> kind<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.840> shocked

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
on even MKV which I was kind of shocked

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.139 
on even MKV which I was kind of shocked
that<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:53.950> actually<00:01:54.070> worked<00:01:54.399> I'm<00:01:54.789> only<00:01:54.880> issue

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
that it actually worked I'm only issue

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.960 
that it actually worked I'm only issue
with<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.479> MKV<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.679> doesn't<00:01:57.189> remove

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
with the MKV is that it doesn't remove

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.120 
with the MKV is that it doesn't remove
subtitles<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:58.929> if<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.380> subtitles

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
over 720p I found it to be laggy arm

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.949 
over 720p I found it to be laggy arm
even<00:02:30.220> playing<00:02:30.700> 1080p<00:02:31.330> videos<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.870> are

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
even playing 1080p videos that are

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.470 
even playing 1080p videos that are

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
voice isn't only sync correctly I don't

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.220 
voice isn't only sync correctly I don't
really<00:02:37.360> know<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.750> issue<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:37.989> with<00:02:38.200> that

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
really know what the issue is with that

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.690 
really know what the issue is with that
but<00:02:38.739> um<00:02:39.569> yeah<00:02:40.569> just<00:02:41.049> stick<00:02:41.290> below<00:02:41.530> 720p<00:02:42.250> this

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
but um yeah just stick below 720p this

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.830 
but um yeah just stick below 720p this
is<00:02:42.880> 720p<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> works<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.320> fine<00:02:45.630> also<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
is 720p and it works just fine also the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.069 
is 720p and it works just fine also the
buttons<00:02:47.230> are<00:02:47.470> like<00:02:47.620> super<00:02:48.100> small<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
buttons are like super small this is

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.960 
buttons are like super small this is
mainly<00:02:50.290> because<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.100> direct<00:02:51.579> port<00:02:51.850> of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
mainly because it is a direct port of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.259 
mainly because it is a direct port of
the<00:02:52.150> windows<00:02:52.510> app<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:54.519> app<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.940> Windows

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
the windows app and the app on Windows

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.710 
the windows app and the app on Windows
is<00:02:55.420> normally<00:02:55.750> being<00:02:55.870> clicked<00:02:56.230> by<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.859> mouse<00:02:57.280> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
is normally being clicked by a mouse and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.300 
is normally being clicked by a mouse and
so<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.019> really<00:02:59.140> translate<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.829> well<00:03:00.040> when

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
so this is really translate to well when

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.300 
so this is really translate to well when
switching<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.000> touchscreen<00:03:01.420> device<00:03:02.310> but

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
switching it to a touchscreen device but

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.860 
switching it to a touchscreen device but
I<00:03:03.340> heard<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.180> skin<00:03:04.510> out<00:03:04.690> there

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
I heard that there is a skin out there

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.949 
I heard that there is a skin out there
that<00:03:05.079> arm<00:03:05.850> converts<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.239> whole<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.720> are

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that arm converts this whole you are

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.949 
that arm converts this whole you are
into<00:03:08.260> more<00:03:08.500> touch<00:03:09.430> friendly<00:03:09.730> or<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.720> get<00:03:10.870> what
