00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
constitute a whole deck profile just to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.490 
constitute a whole deck profile just to
show<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.460> cards<00:00:20.820> change<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.500> obviously

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
show you one cards change so obviously

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
show you one cards change so obviously
it<00:00:22.650> took<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> whole<00:00:23.039> band<00:00:23.340> list<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.730> me<00:00:23.820> to

it took a whole band list for me to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
it took a whole band list for me to
actually<00:00:24.449> change<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.609> underway

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
actually change it so let's get underway

I start with the staples here the main
tuners<00:00:29.340> themselves<00:00:32.480> 3<00:00:33.480> junk<00:00:33.719> Synchron

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
tuners themselves 3 junk Synchron

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
tuners themselves 3 junk Synchron
obviously<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.219> star<00:00:35.670> hitter<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
obviously he is the star hitter of the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
obviously he is the star hitter of the
deck<00:00:36.840> he's<00:00:37.260> bass<00:00:37.739> player<00:00:39.469> then<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.890> run<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
deck he's bass player then I run to
