00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
down stroke is a rest stroke so I'm

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.760 
down stroke is a rest stroke so I'm
going<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.630> gives<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.869> nice<00:01:36.020> punchy<00:01:36.530> kind

when<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.739> my<00:02:33.770> G<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.489> couple<00:02:35.180> things<00:02:35.330> I'll

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
when I get to my G a couple things I'll

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.449 
when I get to my G a couple things I'll
often<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.140> little<00:02:36.410> hammer<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.860> into<00:02:37.220> G

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
often do that little hammer on into G

often do that little hammer on into G
figure

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.450 

and<00:02:43.030> then<00:02:43.960> I'll<00:02:44.080> throw<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.470> bass<00:02:44.680> run<00:02:44.980> ending

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and then I'll throw on a bass run ending

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.770 
and then I'll throw on a bass run ending
on<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:46.090> know<00:02:46.210> just<00:02:46.570> a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
on a you know just a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.000 
on a you know just a
it<00:02:49.260> sounds<00:02:49.560> like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.370 

that's<00:02:56.510> when<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.990> sea<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
that's when I get to the sea that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.340 
that's when I get to the sea that
follows<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:59.690> instead<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.750> hitting<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.080> basin

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
follows that instead of hitting a basin

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.240 
follows that instead of hitting a basin
I'll<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.040> power<00:03:02.280> strum<00:03:02.640> that's<00:03:04.250> then

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
I'll do just a power strum that's then

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740 
I'll do just a power strum that's then
I'll<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> same<00:03:05.760> thing<00:03:05.820> i<00:03:06.030> Massey<00:03:06.330> seventh

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I'll do the same thing i Massey seventh

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.809 
I'll do the same thing i Massey seventh
chord<00:03:06.990> that's

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.039 

way<00:03:15.510> I'll<00:03:15.959> do<00:03:16.230> my<00:03:16.379> cool<00:03:16.680> G<00:03:16.890> seventh<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
way I'll do my cool G seventh with the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.790 
way I'll do my cool G seventh with the
ring

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.920 

so<00:03:25.430> very<00:03:25.670> slowly<00:03:25.820> here's<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.390> whole<00:03:26.510> package

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
so very slowly here's the whole package

00:03:26.930 --> 00:04:04.059 
so very slowly here's the whole package
of<00:03:27.130> different<00:03:28.130> textures<00:03:28.550> on<00:03:28.670> this

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.129
