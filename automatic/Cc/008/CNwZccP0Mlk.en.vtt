00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
selection I am going to be picking the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.800 
selection I am going to be picking the
mailbox<00:03:06.350> role<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.400> client<00:03:07.850> access<00:03:08.240> role

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
mailbox role and the client access role

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.840 
mailbox role and the client access role
because<00:03:09.050> again<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:10.010> testing

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
because again this is a testing

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.240 
because again this is a testing
environment<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.540> want<00:03:11.840> both<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> these<00:03:12.890> things

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
environment I want both of these things

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.900 
environment I want both of these things
to<00:03:13.490> be<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.060> same<00:03:14.270> box<00:03:15.010> okay<00:03:16.010> we're<00:03:16.820> gonna

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
to be on the same box okay we're gonna

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.070 
to be on the same box okay we're gonna
hit<00:03:17.120> next<00:03:17.800> but<00:03:18.800> again<00:03:19.010> let<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:19.280> go<00:03:19.370> back<00:03:19.550> and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
hit next but again let me go back and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.720 
hit next but again let me go back and
best<00:03:21.080> practice<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.739> most<00:03:22.190> likely<00:03:22.519> you're<00:03:22.700> not

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
best practice is most likely you're not

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.400 
best practice is most likely you're not
gonna<00:03:23.090> have<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.450> mailbox<00:03:23.840> row<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.320> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
gonna have the mailbox row and the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.710 
gonna have the mailbox row and the
client<00:03:24.769> access<00:03:24.890> row<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.459> same<00:03:25.489> box<00:03:25.880> so

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
client access row on the same box so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.990 
client access row on the same box so
don't<00:03:27.500> think<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.980> production<00:03:28.340> move

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
don't think this is a production move

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.390 
don't think this is a production move
this<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:29.989> more<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.380> testing<00:03:30.800> laughs<00:03:30.980> move

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
this is more of a testing laughs move

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.940 
this is more of a testing laughs move
but<00:03:32.269> if<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.480> guys<00:03:32.660> are<00:03:33.140> doing<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.890> a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
but if you guys are doing this in a

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.949 
but if you guys are doing this in a
production<00:03:34.130> you're<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.239> be<00:03:35.360> separating

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
production you're going to be separating

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.870 
production you're going to be separating
these<00:03:36.230> two<00:03:36.290> roles<00:03:36.800> in<00:03:37.010> two<00:03:37.220> different<00:03:37.519> server

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
these two roles in two different server

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.009 
these two roles in two different server
boxes<00:03:38.330> hit<00:03:39.260> next<00:03:40.360> best<00:03:41.360> practice<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:41.989> believe

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
boxes hit next best practice I believe

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.400 
boxes hit next best practice I believe
in<00:03:42.380> my<00:03:42.530> eyes<00:03:42.769> is<00:03:43.160> move<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.690> exchange<00:03:45.200> to

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
in my eyes is move the exchange to

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.960 
in my eyes is move the exchange to
something<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.010> another<00:03:46.250> partition<00:03:46.640> don't

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
something to another partition don't

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.420 
something to another partition don't
leave<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.600> C<00:03:47.750> Drive<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.280> I'm<00:03:49.280> just

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
leave it on the C Drive so I'm just

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.479 
leave it on the C Drive so I'm just
gonna<00:03:49.519> leave<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.850> as<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.150> hit<00:03:50.510> next<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.019> then

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
gonna leave it as is hit next and then

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.040 
gonna leave it as is hit next and then
da<00:03:52.489> on<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.760> exchange<00:03:53.150> organization<00:03:53.900> is

saw DHCP install the the mailbox role
install<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:08.020> could<00:05:08.139> do<00:05:08.229> all<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.680> one<00:05:08.710> box

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
install you could do all that in one box

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.070 
install you could do all that in one box
because<00:05:09.520> again<00:05:09.759> is<00:05:09.880> for<00:05:10.210> testing<00:05:10.509> only<00:05:10.990> you

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
because again is for testing only you

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.930 
because again is for testing only you
want<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.349> make<00:05:11.500> sure<00:05:11.740> everything<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.729> working

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940

want to make sure everything is working
properly<00:05:13.449> in<00:05:13.870> your<00:05:13.900> environment<00:05:14.530> before<00:05:14.880> you

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
properly in your environment before you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.460 
properly in your environment before you
start<00:05:16.120> pushing<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.599> stuff<00:05:16.810> out<00:05:16.960> in<00:05:17.229> mass

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
start pushing this stuff out in mass

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.149 
start pushing this stuff out in mass
production<00:05:18.099> so<00:05:18.280> I'm<00:05:18.880> gonna<00:05:19.030> hit<00:05:19.210> install<00:05:19.630> and

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
production so I'm gonna hit install and

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.029 
production so I'm gonna hit install and
this<00:05:21.159> installation<00:05:22.120> only<00:05:22.599> takes<00:05:22.930> between<00:05:23.080> 45

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
this installation only takes between 45

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.529 
this installation only takes between 45
to<00:05:24.400> an<00:05:24.430> hour<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.720> pretty<00:05:26.110> huge<00:05:27.360> so<00:05:28.360> if<00:05:28.449> you

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
to an hour so it's pretty huge so if you

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.149 
to an hour so it's pretty huge so if you
guys<00:05:28.690> are<00:05:29.050> planning<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.620> do<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.099> a

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
guys are planning to do this in a

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.770 
guys are planning to do this in a
production<00:05:30.340> environment<00:05:30.699> this<00:05:31.360> is<00:05:31.509> most

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
production environment this is most

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.370 
production environment this is most
likely<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:32.320> Friday<00:05:32.979> afternoon<00:05:33.780> kind<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.870> job<00:05:35.050> or
