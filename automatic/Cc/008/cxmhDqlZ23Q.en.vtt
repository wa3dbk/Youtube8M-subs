00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 trainer adrie koster second round of but bayern leverkusen it was not the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.119
 first home against the plans have succeeded an art 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:12.289
 that was natural 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.579
 for us all 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.130
 base match watch out what is an opponent of a decent level 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.599
 game that is lieke and then you know that you have a strong team 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.470
 expect 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 but I think we gave a good game 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.369
 so also the client but also little to play as the canal there 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 the man quickly tried to put pressure and we made it difficult for the opponent 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 they had a hard time but I thought the extent the game progressed we arrived 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.060
 better in our own game 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 the latter being those that have dust hail 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.500
 2 0 a justified result was extinguished portraits from the report of the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.589
 keeper earlier that's me 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.050
 to study 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.060
 christ the room for an employer 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.560
 a detective under control 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.290
 groningen a simple today that is at the core if i'm good in the second half 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.520
 opponent plays 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 And it's nice to have the preparations 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.790
 so that we were in top club sinke at the time of the best with it 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.810
 so well full 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.010
 it is also nice for the supporters the penalty was not good left funds 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.110
 worry less if I put another I am 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.830
 the distrust 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.530
 how said kick off very good how bad it is going to do dramatic 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 everyone keeps many new guys on the field 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.860
 satisfied with what you think about it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.480
 the supermarkets are the ones you have trained with 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.260
 pump grow 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.160
 back here after it all needs to be sharper on both sides that seems to me 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.850
 clear but that is a matter of time that you have to give it to us 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.900
 but 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 the intention is a clear signal that you are doing well on the field and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 i think i were seeing the nice things 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 not only see nice things but also maintain a mentality on it 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.230
 last eu country to 22 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.690
 It also testifies to mental achievement that you must also be lucky with 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.900
 have of course 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.950
 we also have other side to force that too 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.259
 That also declined, and at Delft again our pilot was more 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.159
 space was some fatigue in the team 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.659
 n va defends showy africa unsigned more away and came back under 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.059
 pressure because they also print some faster recipes what aggressive game of the 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.259
 I found the first half 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.969
 yes and then she can still go back in the game, now let them on 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.349
 enforce the album how to grow up right away to make a winning hit 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 furthermore it became known that top man achievement 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.279
 in the first game but had been done 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:39.049
 that has a prorail spokeswoman if you reported that as I have me 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.529
 conquer the Spanish number two in the world 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:47.799
 the kemperbergerweg the room they win so there you think the rules beckert 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.439
 anholt book the public 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.889
 safin where does this go the contest starts with the project contest there 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.890
 were four times off for other weather related 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.060
 however, if you are a file that can withstand the picture, the chance of doing so is somewhat 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.429
 also became cheaper in this world 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.089
 but I do not know whether or not the first the best that is the first big test 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.619
 then you have to make a declaration 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:17.239
 That is the core tie that was well able to show that Norwegians and then not 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.619
 only the not only the supporters but also and six points 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.170
 all this to see more than a hundred mesh side percent of his body 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.759
 the new season means corporate profits so why something like that 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.259
 come out fantastic again, so we will certainly go three tens more 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.069
 not differentiation 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.989
 the salary as the lightning came to 65 65 and who do this through getting started with it 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.019
 family's future good luck
