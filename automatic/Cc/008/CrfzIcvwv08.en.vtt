00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
science behind the hood how is that your

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.620 
science behind the hood how is that your
cat<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:35.020> able<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.440> purr<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.610> many<00:00:36.880> reasons<00:00:37.150> why

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
cats purr we're going to talk about the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.640 
cats purr we're going to talk about the
interesting<00:00:40.000> vocal<00:00:40.690> frequency<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.470> your

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
interesting vocal frequency that your

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
interesting vocal frequency that your
cats<00:00:41.890> purr<00:00:42.250> makes<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.850> how<00:00:43.270> it<00:00:43.570> affects<00:00:44.080> us

so<00:00:53.020> good<00:00:53.230> for<00:00:53.440> us

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
so good for us

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.910 
so good for us
so<00:00:54.640> what<00:00:54.790> is<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.060> science<00:00:55.540> behind<00:00:55.900> a<00:00:56.110> purr<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
so what is the science behind a purr the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.830 
so what is the science behind a purr the
way<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.220> works<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.670> your<00:00:57.820> cat's<00:00:58.030> brain<00:00:58.390> will

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
way it works is your cat's brain will

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.830 
way it works is your cat's brain will
send<00:00:59.110> signals<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.860> his<00:01:00.160> larynx<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.940> then<00:01:01.690> that

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
send signals to his larynx and then that

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.139 
send signals to his larynx and then that
causes<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.380> larynx<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:03.100> vibrate<00:01:03.610> and

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
causes the larynx to vibrate and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.100 
causes the larynx to vibrate and
anywhere<00:01:04.449> between<00:01:04.740> 50<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.979> 150<00:01:07.110> vibrations

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
anywhere between 50 to 150 vibrations

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.320 
anywhere between 50 to 150 vibrations
per<00:01:08.380> minute<00:01:08.410> so<00:01:09.160> then<00:01:09.310> any<00:01:09.580> time<00:01:09.880> your<00:01:10.149> cat

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
per minute so then any time your cat

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.690 
per minute so then any time your cat
inhales<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:11.110> exhales<00:01:11.500> they're<00:01:12.340> gonna<00:01:12.460> hear

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
inhales and exhales they're gonna hear

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.840 
inhales and exhales they're gonna hear
the<00:01:12.820> sound<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.420> perv<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.830> all<00:01:15.009> cats<00:01:15.369> can

here right now

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.820 
here right now
she's<00:01:58.119> pretty<00:01:58.479> content<00:01:58.900> hanging<00:01:59.409> out<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.710> the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
she's pretty content hanging out on the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.640 
she's pretty content hanging out on the
couch<00:02:00.540> getting<00:02:01.540> petted<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.290> right<00:02:02.470> way

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650

looked at a number of the cats purrs the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.780 
looked at a number of the cats purrs the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
low-end that the frequency ramp went

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.050 
low-end that the frequency ramp went
from<00:02:23.000> somewhere<00:02:23.299> between<00:02:23.450> 200<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.819> 550<00:02:25.819> Hertz

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.119 
from somewhere between 200 to 550 Hertz
which<00:02:26.629> is<00:02:26.750> very<00:02:26.930> similar<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.650> crimes<00:02:27.980> that

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
which is very similar to the crimes that

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.309 
which is very similar to the crimes that
human<00:02:28.549> baby<00:02:28.909> would<00:02:29.209> make<00:02:29.359> somewhere<00:02:30.140> between

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
a 300 to 500 Hertz range so in terms of

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.069 
a 300 to 500 Hertz range so in terms of
seeing<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.400> similarity<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.629> thought<00:02:35.870> is

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
seeing that similarity the thought is

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.660 
seeing that similarity the thought is
that<00:02:36.109> there's<00:02:36.500> something<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.040> purr<00:02:37.400> has

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
that there's something a purr has

that there's something a purr has
developed<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:39.049> triggers<00:02:39.439> us<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:39.890> people<00:02:40.129> to

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
developed that triggers us as people to

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.210 
developed that triggers us as people to
respond<00:02:41.329> when<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:41.750> hear<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.170> crying<00:02:42.590> baby<00:02:42.739> or

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
respond when we hear that crying baby or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.089 
respond when we hear that crying baby or
instantly<00:02:44.090> trigger<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.569> respond<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.260> it's

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
instantly trigger to respond so it's

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.949 
instantly trigger to respond so it's
quite<00:02:46.280> possible<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.879> we<00:02:47.060> hear<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.569> perv

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.030 
question is a whole host of benefits
from<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.849> human<00:04:06.150> animal<00:04:06.569> bond<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.110> burning

from the human animal bond and burning

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.860 
from the human animal bond and burning
is<00:04:08.160> just<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.640> those<00:04:08.760> ways<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.090> we

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
is just one of those ways that we

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.839 
is just one of those ways that we
directly<00:04:10.290> bonk<00:04:10.650> their<00:04:10.950> cats<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.549> then<00:04:11.670> by

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
directly bonk their cats and then by

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.460 
directly bonk their cats and then by
doing<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.299> we<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.690> those<00:04:12.840> therapeutic
