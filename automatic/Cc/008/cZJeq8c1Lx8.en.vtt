00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
essentially has all carbon fiber on the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
essentially has all carbon fiber on the
edges<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> top<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.780> could<00:00:37.140> check<00:00:37.590> out

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
edges and on the top you could check out

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400 
edges and on the top you could check out
them<00:00:37.920> we've<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.520> got<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> nice<00:00:39.140> will<00:00:40.140> weave

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
them we've it's got a nice will weave

them we've it's got a nice will weave
carbon<00:00:40.860> fiber<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.550> stands<00:00:42.059> out

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
carbon fiber that really stands out

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
carbon fiber that really stands out
especially<00:00:42.800> when<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.250> light<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
especially when you get some light on it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.630 
especially when you get some light on it
and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.329> besides<00:00:46.789> our<00:00:48.140> six-oh<00:00:49.140> six-one

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
and then besides our six-oh six-one

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
and then besides our six-oh six-one
heat-treated<00:00:50.640> aluminum<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
heat-treated aluminum and they have I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
heat-treated aluminum and they have I
guess<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.670> laser<00:00:53.969> etched<00:00:54.300> auto

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
guess that's a little laser etched auto

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
guess that's a little laser etched auto
design<00:00:55.039> Auto<00:00:56.039> art<00:00:56.309> design<00:00:56.670> logo<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:58.980> does

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
design Auto art design logo so how does

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
design Auto art design logo so how does
it<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.520> work<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.750> simple<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:02.100> you
