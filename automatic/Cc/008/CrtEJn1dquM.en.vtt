00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
have here which is the blackout bed bug

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.200 
have here which is the blackout bed bug
detector<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.090> an

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
detector and what this is is it's an

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.520 
detector and what this is is it's an
interception<00:00:12.660> device<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> bedbug

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
interception device or a bedbug

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.650 
interception device or a bedbug
interception<00:00:14.250> device<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.360> put<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
interception device and you can put it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.019 
interception device and you can put it
under<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> legs<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.650> beds<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.279> couches<00:00:17.430> like

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
under the legs of beds and couches like

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.260 
under the legs of beds and couches like
so<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.890> it'll<00:00:19.890> help<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> catch<00:00:20.580> bedbugs<00:00:21.090> if

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so and it'll help you catch bedbugs if

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
so and it'll help you catch bedbugs if
they<00:00:21.420> naturally<00:00:22.020> travel<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.680> an

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
they naturally travel around an

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
they naturally travel around an
environment<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.240> let's<00:00:24.420> say<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.630> bring<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
environment and so let's say you bring a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810 
environment and so let's say you bring a
bedbug<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> suitcase<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> trip

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
bedbug in on the suitcase of a trip

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.519 
bedbug in on the suitcase of a trip
where<00:00:27.060> you're<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> whole<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.930> infested<00:00:28.439> with

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
where you're a whole is infested with

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
where you're a whole is infested with
bedbugs<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.189> hiding<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.670> clutter<00:00:30.029> as

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
bedbugs that are hiding in clutter as

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
bedbugs that are hiding in clutter as
they<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> bed<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.800> feed<00:00:32.009> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
they come to the bed to feed on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
they come to the bed to feed on
unfortunately<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> person<00:00:33.149> sleeping<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
unfortunately the person sleeping in

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.360 
unfortunately the person sleeping in
that<00:00:33.840> bed<00:00:33.960> they're<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> walk<00:00:35.190> up

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that bed they're gonna have to walk up

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
that bed they're gonna have to walk up

can help you treat an infestation you
know<00:00:44.579> where<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> put<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.360> place<00:00:45.570> after

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
know where you put them in place after

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
know where you put them in place after
your<00:00:46.200> initial<00:00:46.530> bed<00:00:46.890> bug<00:00:47.100> service<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> they're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
your initial bed bug service and they're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
your initial bed bug service and they're
catching<00:00:48.210> bugs<00:00:48.420> between<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:49.050> initial<00:00:49.469> bed

catching bugs between your initial bed
book<00:00:49.770> service<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.430> follow-up<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
book service and your follow-up and you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
book service and your follow-up and you
empty<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
empty them out you know on that that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
empty them out you know on that that
follow-up<00:00:54.329> visit<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
follow-up visit and so there's a lot of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
follow-up visit and so there's a lot of
different<00:00:56.340> ways<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.059> these

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
different ways that you can use these

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
different ways that you can use these
devices<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> video<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.670> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
devices and there's a video out there in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.580 
devices and there's a video out there in
bed<00:00:59.940> bug<00:01:00.120> TV<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.719> called<00:01:00.960> interception

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
bed bug TV that's called interception

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
bed bug TV that's called interception
devices<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.190> goes<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.940> how<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.570> use

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
devices that goes into how you can use

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
devices that goes into how you can use
these<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> research<00:01:05.040> behind<00:01:05.339> them<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
these and the research behind them and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
these and the research behind them and
how<00:01:06.270> effective<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
how effective they are and so I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
how effective they are and so I
recommend<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> watch<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
recommend that you watch that if you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
recommend that you watch that if you
want<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.020> background<00:01:10.439> information<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
want all the background information I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.670 
want all the background information I
just<00:01:11.340> wanted<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> provide<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.390> basic

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
just wanted to provide some basic

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
just wanted to provide some basic
information<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> concept<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
information on the concept of the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
information on the concept of the
devices<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.740> said<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
devices and so as I said this is the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
devices and so as I said this is the
blackout<00:01:17.820> bed<00:01:18.030> bug<00:01:18.210> detector<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
blackout bed bug detector now I want to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
blackout bed bug detector now I want to
say<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> device

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
say now that you know this is a device

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.749 
say now that you know this is a device
that<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.570> designed<00:01:21.990> myself

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
that I designed myself

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.280 
that I designed myself
and<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.030> obviously<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.689> therefore<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> have

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and that obviously them therefore I have

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
and that obviously them therefore I have
a<00:01:25.320> vested<00:01:25.680> interest<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> success<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
a vested interest in the success of this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
a vested interest in the success of this
device<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.200> you'll<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.979> out

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
device but what you'll see if you go out

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560 
device but what you'll see if you go out
there<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> research<00:01:30.360> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
there and do a little bit of research on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
there and do a little bit of research on

bed bug central on the Internet in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
bed bug central on the Internet in
general<00:01:32.130> you'll<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.479> I've<00:01:33.630> been<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
general you'll see that I've been on the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
general you'll see that I've been on the
interception<00:01:35.100> device<00:01:35.490> bandwagon<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.450> many

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
interception device bandwagon for many

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
interception device bandwagon for many
years<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.549> something<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.000> I've

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
years now this is something that I've

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.969 
years now this is something that I've
always<00:01:39.270> believed<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> we've<00:01:40.140> always<00:01:40.380> used<00:01:40.770> as

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
always believed in we've always used as

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
always believed in we've always used as
part<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> our<00:01:41.369> services<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.479> saw<00:01:42.720> some

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
part of our services and I saw some

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
part of our services and I saw some
shortcomings<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> devices

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
shortcomings and some of the devices

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
shortcomings and some of the devices
that<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.960> wanted<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that were out there and I wanted to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
that were out there and I wanted to
design<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> device<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> know

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
design a device that can you know

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
design a device that can you know
possibly<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.799> care<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.250> of

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
possibly you know take care of some of

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:50.830 
possibly you know take care of some of
the<00:01:50.460> short

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the short

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.120 
the short
means<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.200> we're<00:01:51.350> out<00:01:51.409> there<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:51.829> I'll<00:01:51.950> talk

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
means that we're out there so I'll talk

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.550 
means that we're out there so I'll talk
a<00:01:52.159> little<00:01:52.280> bit<00:01:52.549> about<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> basically

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
a little bit about that so basically

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.929 
a little bit about that so basically
what<00:01:54.860> we<00:01:54.950> wanted<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.280> do<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:55.520> we<00:01:55.640> wanted<00:01:55.880> to

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
what we wanted to do is we wanted to

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.999 
what we wanted to do is we wanted to
create<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.240> device<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.200> didn't<00:01:57.710> break

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
create a device that that didn't break

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.859 
create a device that that didn't break
or<00:01:58.280> crack<00:01:58.520> as<00:01:58.909> easily<00:01:59.210> some<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.750> other

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
or crack as easily some of the other

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.389 
or crack as easily some of the other
devices<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.470> there<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:00.890> we're<00:02:01.039> using<00:02:01.220> a

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
devices out there and so we're using a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.210 
devices out there and so we're using a
much<00:02:01.549> stronger<00:02:01.939> plastic<00:02:03.220> there's

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
much stronger plastic there's

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.980 
much stronger plastic there's
information<00:02:04.520> out<00:02:04.939> there<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.149> bedbugs<00:02:05.810> are

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
information out there that bedbugs are

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.899 
information out there that bedbugs are
actually<00:02:06.409> attracted<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.399> color<00:02:07.549> black

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
actually attracted to the color black

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.639 
actually attracted to the color black
and<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.450> that's<00:02:08.599> one<00:02:08.840> reason<00:02:08.869> why<00:02:09.440> they're

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and so that's one reason why they're

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.559 
and so that's one reason why they're
black<00:02:09.860> what<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.310> have<00:02:10.489> found<00:02:10.729> after<00:02:11.420> we

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
black what we have found after we

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.390 
black what we have found after we
started<00:02:11.959> working<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.319> them<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:12.769> they

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
started working with them is that they

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.820 
started working with them is that they
tend<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.819> blend<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.690> bag<00:02:14.900> bed<00:02:15.349> much

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
tend to blend in with the bag bed much

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.620 
tend to blend in with the bag bed much
much<00:02:16.069> better<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.000> they're<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> little<00:02:17.420> bit

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
much better and so they're a little bit

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.199 
much better and so they're a little bit
more<00:02:17.830> aesthetically<00:02:18.830> pleasing<00:02:18.980> shall<00:02:19.849> we<00:02:20.000> say

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
more aesthetically pleasing shall we say

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.820 
more aesthetically pleasing shall we say
or<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.660> just<00:02:20.720> tend<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.650> visible

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
or they just tend to not be as visible

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.080 
or they just tend to not be as visible
some<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.489> other<00:02:22.610> ones<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.060> out

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
some of the other ones that are out

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.680 
some of the other ones that are out
there<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.950> device<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.700> particular<00:02:26.239> does<00:02:26.450> not

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
there this device in particular does not

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
there this device in particular does not
use<00:02:27.049> or<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.069> required<00:02:28.549> to<00:02:29.120> use

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
use or it is not required to use

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.930 
use or it is not required to use
lubricants<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.709> actual<00:02:31.100> track<00:02:31.519> welds

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
lubricants in the actual track welds

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.009 
lubricants in the actual track welds
there<00:02:32.090> are<00:02:32.180> other<00:02:32.330> devices<00:02:32.450> out<00:02:32.810> there<00:02:32.989> that

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
there are other devices out there that

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.270 
there are other devices out there that
use<00:02:33.200> talcum<00:02:33.680> powder<00:02:33.709> or<00:02:34.250> oils<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.959> well

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
use talcum powder or oils in this well

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.620 
use talcum powder or oils in this well
the<00:02:37.280> way<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.849> designed<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.480> not

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
the way that this is designed that's not

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.460 
the way that this is designed that's not
necessary

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
necessary

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.710 
necessary
now<00:02:39.590> what<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.310> means<00:02:40.910> though<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
now what that means though is that you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.140 
now what that means though is that you
should<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.230> cleaning<00:02:42.650> these<00:02:42.920> wells<00:02:43.310> out<00:02:43.610> very

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
should be cleaning these wells out very

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.240 
should be cleaning these wells out very
very<00:02:44.239> frequently<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.500> can't<00:02:45.890> tell<00:02:46.099> you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
very frequently now I can't tell you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.610 
very frequently now I can't tell you
exactly<00:02:46.400> what<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.030> frequency<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:48.049> cuz<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
exactly what that frequency is cuz as I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.229 
exactly what that frequency is cuz as I
said<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.069> just<00:02:49.400> been<00:02:49.519> introduced<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
said these have just been introduced and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.670 
said these have just been introduced and
we<00:02:50.330> don't<00:02:50.540> have<00:02:50.690> all<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.930> information<00:02:51.230> yet

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
we don't have all the information yet

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.220 
we don't have all the information yet
but<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.430> would<00:02:52.640> say<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:52.970> every<00:02:53.360> two<00:02:53.599> weeks<00:02:53.930> to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
but I would say that every two weeks to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.900 
but I would say that every two weeks to
three<00:02:54.500> weeks<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:55.310> should<00:02:55.459> be<00:02:55.519> taking<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
three weeks you should be taking a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.720 
three weeks you should be taking a
microfiber<00:02:56.570> anti<00:02:57.049> scratch<00:02:57.260> cloth<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.010> wiping

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
microfiber anti scratch cloth and wiping

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
microfiber anti scratch cloth and wiping
the<00:02:58.760> wells<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.359> to<00:02:59.810> get<00:02:59.930> all<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.230> dust<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
the wells out to get all the dust and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.370 
the wells out to get all the dust and
debris<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.700> builds<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:02.180> inside<00:03:02.359> there<00:03:02.840> out

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
debris that builds up inside there out

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.080 
debris that builds up inside there out
so<00:03:03.799> that<00:03:03.950> way<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> bugs<00:03:04.400> can't<00:03:04.700> use<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.030> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so that way the bugs can't use that to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.300 
so that way the bugs can't use that to
get<00:03:05.359> out<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.780> device<00:03:06.079> some<00:03:07.069> of<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> other

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
get out of the device some of the other

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.920 
get out of the device some of the other
devices<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.760> use<00:03:08.000> lubricants<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.810> know

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
devices that use lubricants you know

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.440 
devices that use lubricants you know
those<00:03:09.500> also<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.250> dusty<00:03:10.670> over<00:03:10.760> time<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.359> need

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
those also get dusty over time and need

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.030 
those also get dusty over time and need
to<00:03:11.540> be<00:03:11.660> clean<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.859> that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
to be clean and because of that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.590 
to be clean and because of that
lubricant<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.000> clean<00:03:14.269> out<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
lubricant you have to clean out the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.930 
lubricant you have to clean out the
lubricant<00:03:15.109> dry<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:15.890> out<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.370> then<00:03:16.489> reapply

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
lubricant dry it out and then reapply

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.430 
lubricant dry it out and then reapply
the<00:03:17.090> lubricant<00:03:17.750> every<00:03:17.959> time<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.290> do<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
the lubricant every time you do that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080 
the lubricant every time you do that
just<00:03:18.829> wiping<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.370> out<00:03:19.489> every<00:03:19.730> couple<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:20.030> weeks

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
just wiping it out every couple of weeks

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.240 
just wiping it out every couple of weeks
I<00:03:20.299> personally<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:21.380> isn't<00:03:21.769> much<00:03:21.920> easier

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
I personally I think isn't much easier

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.190 
I personally I think isn't much easier
way<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.579> about<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.840> was<00:03:24.049> one

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
way to go about this and so that was one

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920 
way to go about this and so that was one
of<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.350> other<00:03:24.530> design<00:03:24.889> features<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:26.450> that's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
of the other design features and that's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.599 
of the other design features and that's
basically<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.739> couple<00:03:28.100> things<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
basically the couple things that I

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.190 
basically the couple things that I
wanted<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.030> address<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.600> was<00:03:29.870> developing

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
wanted to address when I was developing

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.509 
wanted to address when I was developing
you<00:03:30.680> know<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:30.980> actually<00:03:31.040> thinking<00:03:31.459> about

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
you know and actually thinking about

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.640 
you know and actually thinking about
creating<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.239> device<00:03:32.600> addressing<00:03:33.560> the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
creating this device addressing the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.080 
creating this device addressing the
cracking<00:03:34.130> addressing<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.910> need<00:03:35.060> for

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
cracking addressing the need for

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.770 
cracking addressing the need for
lubricants<00:03:36.760> changing<00:03:37.760> colors<00:03:38.120> over<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.540> black

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
lubricants changing colors over to black

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.539 
lubricants changing colors over to black
because<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.769> some<00:03:39.859> of<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.010> information<00:03:40.130> you

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
because of some of the information you

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.640 
because of some of the information you
had<00:03:40.730> out<00:03:40.910> there<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.049> black<00:03:42.440> out

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
had out there and that is the black out

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.520 
had out there and that is the black out
bed<00:03:42.889> bug<00:03:43.069> detectors<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.900> as<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.109> said<00:03:45.319> under

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
bed bug detectors and so as I said under

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.650 
bed bug detectors and so as I said under
the<00:03:45.739> lights<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.069> beds<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.400> couches<00:03:46.579> but<00:03:47.510> it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
the lights of beds and couches but it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.360 
the lights of beds and couches but it
will<00:03:47.780> trap<00:03:48.079> bugs<00:03:48.350> as<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:48.620> travel<00:03:49.069> to

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
will trap bugs as they travel to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400 
will trap bugs as they travel to
from<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.970> better<00:03:50.239> or<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.900> investment

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
from that better or the investment

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.199 
from that better or the investment
environment<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.370> also<00:03:52.519> put<00:03:52.849> them<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.090> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
environment you can also put them on the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.630 
environment you can also put them on the
floor<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.810> researchers<00:03:54.709> shown<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.280> other

floor and researchers shown that other

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.190 
floor and researchers shown that other
interception<00:03:56.420> devices<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.959> are<00:03:57.050> out<00:03:57.080> there

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
interception devices that are out there

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.400 
interception devices that are out there
will<00:03:57.760> typically<00:03:58.760> detect<00:03:59.239> 70<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.930> 80<00:04:00.140> percent

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
will typically detect 70 to 80 percent

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.559 
will typically detect 70 to 80 percent
of<00:04:00.769> bedbug<00:04:01.190> infestations<00:04:02.000> over<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.330> course

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
of bedbug infestations over the course

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.479 
of bedbug infestations over the course
of<00:04:02.750> about<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.019> week<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:03.620> these<00:04:03.769> can<00:04:04.040> be<00:04:04.220> very

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
of about a week and so these can be very

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.699 
of about a week and so these can be very
very<00:04:04.790> interception<00:04:05.360> devices<00:04:05.390> as<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> whole<00:04:06.080> can
