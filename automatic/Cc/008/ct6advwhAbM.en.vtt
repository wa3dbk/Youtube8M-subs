side<00:00:28.770> pivot<00:00:28.950> rebirths<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.360> that<00:00:30.600> need<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
side pivot rebirths to do that need to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.780

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.020 
and front side to 70s I'm pretty sure
what<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
doesn't feel quite like at 360 or go up

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.920

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
try not to be into the pivot for too

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
try not to be into the pivot for too
long<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.759> still<00:01:35.969> have<00:01:36.060> momentum<00:01:36.539> because

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
long so you still have momentum because

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
long so you still have momentum because

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's the momentum of getting into the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.850 
it's the momentum of getting into the
pivot<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.750> keep<00:01:39.899> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.740> do

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
pivot that you use to keep going to do

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
shoulders 70 in that's that let's get

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.949 
shoulders 70 in that's that let's get
out<00:01:58.679> there<00:01:58.890> try<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.599> tumble<00:02:00.599> around<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.899> little

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
out there try it tumble around a little
