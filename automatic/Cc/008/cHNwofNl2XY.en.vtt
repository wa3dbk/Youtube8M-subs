00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.840 

and<00:00:49.650> in<00:00:49.950> high<00:00:50.130> school<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.400> did<00:00:50.580> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.790> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and in high school I did a lot of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.360 
and in high school I did a lot of
exploration<00:00:51.180> i<00:00:51.660> I've<00:00:52.260> always<00:00:52.470> loved<00:00:52.800> math<00:00:53.040> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
exploration i I've always loved math and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
exploration i I've always loved math and
science<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.540> toyed<00:00:54.810> with<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> idea

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
science so I really toyed with the idea

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
science so I really toyed with the idea
of<00:00:55.470> engineering<00:00:56.160> because<00:00:56.580> that<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.060> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of engineering because that just you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.210 
of engineering because that just you
like<00:00:57.690> math<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.080> science<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.470> go<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
like math and science you go with

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.610 
like math and science you go with
engineering<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> explored<00:01:01.290> art

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
engineering but the more I explored art

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
engineering but the more I explored art
and<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.220> of<00:01:02.340> creative<00:01:02.850> thinking<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.300> that's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and sort of creative thinking and that's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.700 
and sort of creative thinking and that's
not<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.780> say<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> engineering<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> not

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
not to say that engineering is not

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
not to say that engineering is not
creative<00:01:05.160> thinking<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.910> explored

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
creative thinking but I explored

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.150 
creative thinking but I explored
aesthetic<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.680> high<00:01:07.860> school

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
aesthetic a little bit in high school

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.250 
aesthetic a little bit in high school
and<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> started<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.480> balance<00:01:09.690> that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and I started to see the balance that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
and I started to see the balance that
architecture<00:01:10.950> provided<00:01:11.400> between<00:01:11.700> math

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
architecture provided between math

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280 
architecture provided between math
science<00:01:12.860> art<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.250> people<00:01:14.850> wow<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.510> school<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
science art and people wow the school of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.120 
science art and people wow the school of
architecture<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:18.170> remarkable<00:01:19.170> oasis<00:01:19.830> at

department of visualization for example
that<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> strong<00:01:29.850> connection<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> film

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that has a strong connection to the film

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.350 
that has a strong connection to the film

have a series of research centers and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.680 
have a series of research centers and
the<00:01:52.110> sort<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.729> seamless<00:01:53.729> connection<00:01:54.509> of

research and teaching and service is

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.969 
research and teaching and service is
felt<00:01:57.929> at<00:01:58.080> all<00:01:58.200> levels<00:01:58.590> throughout<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
felt at all levels throughout the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.790 
felt at all levels throughout the
college<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> as<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.869> say<00:02:01.050> we<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.319> connections

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
college and as I say we have connections

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.980 
college and as I say we have connections
through<00:02:02.069> most<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.270> departments<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
through most of the departments and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.809 
through most of the departments and
colleges<00:02:04.530> throughout<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.220> university

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
colleges throughout the university

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.309 
colleges throughout the university
that's<00:02:06.300> really<00:02:06.630> important<00:02:07.050> when<00:02:07.200> you're

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
that's really important when you're

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.109 
that's really important when you're
thinking<00:02:07.380> laterally<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> vertically<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
thinking laterally and vertically and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
thinking laterally and vertically and
that's<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.450> those<00:02:09.600> centers<00:02:09.960> have<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> offer

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's what those centers have to offer

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
that's what those centers have to offer
within<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.920> college<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.550> believe<00:02:11.880> that's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
within the college and I believe that's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.290 
within the college and I believe that's
probably<00:02:12.170> very<00:02:13.170> unique<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.060> four

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
probably very unique and we have four

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.570 
probably very unique and we have four
departments<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.990> five<00:02:16.260> centers<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.980> one

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
departments and five centers in one
