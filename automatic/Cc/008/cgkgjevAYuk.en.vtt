 and all versions of resident evil 4 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 both have one or more viruses inside 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.070
 of his body since jill valentine was 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 affected by the t virus in raccoon city 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.780
 which although he was treated with the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.690
 t antigen remained in his body for 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.390
 activated after addition to huesca 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.020
 the inoculum the Eurobonds virus but she 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.460
 he could control it because of the t cells 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.009
 wound was inoculated with the same virus 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.830
 that contains wesker in his body he 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.960
 supposes that it is the virus that which 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.420
 found dying with injected a 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.550
 sample of her blood with which she 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.400
 he could recover 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 each one has proven to be excellent in 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.300
 the handling of weapons and in combat 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.760
 body to body although the main 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.310
 jill ability is opening 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.310
 locks and the life is stealth 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 besides that each one is recognized by 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.190
 a specific color in the case of 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.760
 yale is the blue or celestial and eneida is the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.640
 red or scarlet jill's relationship with 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.620
 Gray is a little more professional as a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.989
 despite giving samples of something more than 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.750
 companionship have never tried to give 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.060
 another step thing that the lyon and of ideas and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.610
 that despite not having much contact 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.310
 they already had a meeting a little more 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.030
 intimate and specifically the kiss that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.890
 They gave in fresh and bulldog 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.930
 both have carried out very 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 important of the entire universe resident 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.640
 and ball in the case of giles 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.010
 would have defeated nemesis and have 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.880
 contributed to the street where the also 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.959
 of being a founding member of the abc ha a 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.300
 just to mention some 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.640
 in the case of life they would have 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.489
 defeated jack krauser and akal to 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.220
 Radames and contribute to the fall of neo 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.140
 man the addition that jill valentine 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.690
 he is the only character that has 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.820
 starring a lone video game in 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.820
 this case just and bolt nemesis 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.530
 the kiss he had with Lyon in his new 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.209
 level 2 has been the only one in the entire saga 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.270
 in every delivery that jill appears 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.490
 valentine also appears chris redfield 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.700
 except reset and vol 3 nemesis and resident 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.130
 evil 6 both in that level 2 and in 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.709
 resident evil 4 and go to intervene in the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.959
 final combat leaving us a rocket launcher 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.420
 to end the enemy and in that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.380
 level 6 does the same thing by leaving 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.690
 rocket launcher to finish we get 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.300
 jill by its appearance resembles a lot 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.760
 to nina williams character in the saga of 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.880
 tech games and also of great beauty and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.290
 master in combat with or without weapons 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.680
 It also has a little resemblance to 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.060
 lara croft star of tomb raider 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.330
 besides that it looks a lot like 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.560
 Fiona Belli from holding ground in fact 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.690
 this game was also made by field 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.850
 in resident and vol, mention is made of 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.370
 name of life through a letter of 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.110
 her boyfriend Jon who tells him to escape the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.480
 mansion for the dangers that inhabited 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.370
 in it also his name is the 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.950
 computer password in the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 laboratories erc law as I was the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.270
 computer technician in said 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.550
 laboratories the above lets you understand 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.849
 that the character was thought from the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.189
 first game 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.439
 jill valentine has not only just come out 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.360
 and bolt it too to come out in others 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.990
 games between them are marc bijl conta 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.839
 cap with 2 project exxon and markota capcom 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.179
 3 in marvel against cap with 2 she 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.429
 he uses his old suit stars and this one 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:01.259
 appears as a playable character 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:03.119
 definitive in marvel with this cab with 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.949
 three this one appears with the suit of 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.119
 mental control that induced him albert 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.289
 wesker appears as a character in lc 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:13.589
 he also appears to be the main enemy 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.830
 nemesis in the beta of rc level 2 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:19.649
 called network level 1.5 and go 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.419
 would appear but not as an agent but 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:22.990
 as a scientist where the name 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.180
 nice word 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.280
 in the stephanie nemesis book where 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.650
 the dog reveals that nicole there are lips 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.180
 since he says he had seen a woman nearby 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.070
 the building of the police station of Raccoon 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.620
 it was a girl with features 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.260
 Asians dressed in a red suit 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.620
 tight sleeveless and that wielded a 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.910
 gun as if he knew how to use it 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.860
 nikolÃ¡y was looking for it almost 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.190
 four hours but did not see again 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.500
 that mysterious woman 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.480
 it is not known why he was not included in 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.580
 lateral more than just level 6 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.400
 but according to capcom his member status 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.160
 active of the you want 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.440
 in that level 3 nemesis when this kills 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.940
 a brad lidge did not save him having the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.400
 opportunity to shoot him with the gun 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.699
 to nemesis in the head 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.040
 and in project x they have the same suit 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.800
 of the game resident evil revelations al 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.139
 just like chris hill has appeared in 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.080
 all odd games including the 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.539
 in equal revelations in resin and ball 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.300
 director's cut barry gives him an agile nickname 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.980
 when he feels like it he is the queen 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.110
 of the picks 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.780
 both great characters of the cen and ball 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.400
 remember that this type of videos do not 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.950
 I do to try to generate controversy 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.510
 but to know more about each 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.190
 character 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.530
 if you want to recommend someone else 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.570
 character for another video of this type or 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.000
 recommend a theme can do it in my 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.430
 Facebook page which will leave you the 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.620
 link in the description says goodbye 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.620
