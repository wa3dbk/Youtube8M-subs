00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
six and then you just try making like a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.230 
six and then you just try making like a
little<00:02:02.640> space<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:05.060> it'll<00:02:06.060> look<00:02:06.180> like

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
little space here so it'll look like

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.979 
little space here so it'll look like
this<00:02:06.600> also<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.350> stick<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.280> glue<00:02:08.989> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this also you could stick to glue the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.949 
this also you could stick to glue the
the<00:02:10.890> wall

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
the wall

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.569 
the wall
so<00:02:12.409> this<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> what<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:12.829> did<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.099> made<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.519> a

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
so this is what I did I made like a

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.240 
so this is what I did I made like a
little<00:02:13.730> space<00:02:15.189> so<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:18.049> cool<00:02:18.290> these<00:02:18.950> three

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
little space so you cool these three

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.789 
little space so you cool these three
first<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.939> sides<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.609> make<00:02:22.849> the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
first the sides and then you make the

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.199 
first the sides and then you make the
top<00:02:24.799> part<00:02:24.829> which<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.700> said<00:02:25.849> there's

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
top part which is like I said there's

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.679 
top part which is like I said there's
eight<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.750> then<00:02:27.379> you<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.480> same

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
eight and then you you you do the same

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.839 
eight and then you you you do the same
thing<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.109> as<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.859> did<00:02:30.889> here<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.549> you<00:02:31.639> put

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
thing here as I did here but you put

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.589 
thing here as I did here but you put
eight<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.900> then<00:02:33.709> what<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:34.879> you<00:02:35.030> put<00:02:35.060> glue

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
eight and then what you do you put glue

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.270 
eight and then what you do you put glue

you could do like a little a wall here

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.149 
you could do like a little a wall here
too<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.099> you<00:02:46.250> want<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.609> mean<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.970> don't<00:02:47.180> use<00:02:47.540> three

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159

too if you want I mean I don't use three
babies<00:02:49.159> more<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.959> yeah<00:02:51.260> that's<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.040> make

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
babies more but yeah that's how I make

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.589 
babies more but yeah that's how I make
my<00:02:52.459> little<00:02:52.609> house<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.329> could<00:02:53.510> I

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
my little house and then you could I

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.300 
my little house and then you could I
haven't<00:02:53.930> tried<00:02:54.109> it<00:02:54.169> with<00:02:54.500> these<00:02:55.659> small<00:02:56.659> sticks

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
haven't tried it with these small sticks

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.319 
haven't tried it with these small sticks
it's<00:02:58.310> gonna<00:02:58.430> be<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.639> little<00:02:58.819> bit<00:02:58.969> harder

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
it's gonna be a little bit harder

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.209 
it's gonna be a little bit harder
because<00:02:59.419> I<00:02:59.959> mean<00:03:00.560> they're<00:03:00.680> smaller<00:03:01.069> and

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
because I mean they're smaller and

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.330 
because I mean they're smaller and
didn't<00:03:01.700> need<00:03:01.909> a<00:03:01.939> lot<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.329> them<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.709> for<00:03:04.129> me<00:03:04.280> it

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
didn't need a lot of them so for me it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.699 
didn't need a lot of them so for me it
was<00:03:04.459> easier<00:03:04.840> with<00:03:06.400> jumbo<00:03:07.400> craft<00:03:07.790> sticks<00:03:08.709> with

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
was easier with jumbo craft sticks with

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.470 
was easier with jumbo craft sticks with
these<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:10.579> what<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.879> could<00:03:11.030> do<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.299> too

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
these and then what you could do it too

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.890 
these and then what you could do it too
so<00:03:12.409> that<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.919> can<00:03:13.099> make<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> little<00:03:13.700> letter<00:03:13.969> so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
so that you can make a little letter so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.770 
so that you can make a little letter so
what<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.049> did<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.290> did<00:03:15.439> the<00:03:16.010> same<00:03:16.190> thing<00:03:16.430> as<00:03:16.780> what
