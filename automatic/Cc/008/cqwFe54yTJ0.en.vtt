00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
 is 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.610
 then just call up one by flashlight 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.480
 white shirt but we do not have a prism to 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.489
 your front 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 we want this dispersion of light in the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.590
 that the white set all the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.750
 funny sky color serves to filter 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 uff passage and just lets 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.670
 light whose redemption frequency is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 corresponding to the color of the paper that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.470
 banana and yellow its color should be 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 fact that this object absorbs all the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.940
 chromatic band in light 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 I found the realization of almost 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.610
 corresponding to the love I want to reflect 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.610
 of this happens with all objects 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.020
 so on the banana is not and turns on 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.659
 yellow version 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.119
 What would be your color to realize this? 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.390
 put your southern foil to blue fan 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.790
 fumtur and banana enter causing 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 it was only subject to aviation 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 blue 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.100
 how can you check the banana 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 appear to be black as it does not 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 has no selection 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.290
 however if I'm the fan it's yellow 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.790
 the only evaluation that passes will be 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.720
 also yellow 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.370
 hence only the yellow has been detained and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 bananas continues to be of 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.970
 own color 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.410
 so I want the chromatic theory of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.630
 pigments or by see that junction 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 of the three primary colors is always 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.890
 in black ocean but yellow people in 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.940
 first or blue red and green rpg on 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.880
 Monday 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.430
 are two combinations in the radiation climate is 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.430
 reflected are all resolved 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.620
 in short this morning by the marina because 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.520
 only of all radiation and cheetahs 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.520
 aversion to maya 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.480
 the secrets that a hose ends in 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.329
 yes 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.650
 in response despite the light assumption all 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.780
 the white corsa 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.780
 the joining of all the pigments will be 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.780
 black
