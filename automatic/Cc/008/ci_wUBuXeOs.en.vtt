00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.630
 part of this video about deployment disappeared 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.700
 it is also a psn free program in excel to me as self-employed people like the 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.659
 can keep track of costs 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.959
 with this so soon we see how it is the erc 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.609
 this type of number of tabs you down the hague 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.429
 they go through again 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.470
 overview 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.440
 an overview 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.540
 dates 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.250
 you can turn that into an abandoned one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.620
 the cost category among others 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 per plate cost that cost prepared this claim you make here in there 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 you are in your closet 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.160
 I am going to enter it is a shining path at cost tiger hidden dragon 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.560
 I choose here 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.920
 the category 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.190
 I had no choice myself 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.670
 for its editors 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 The latest data from China Tuesday 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 and the amount 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.470
 I looked at including or excluding VAT very amount 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.760
 I can choose from VAT percentage this increase is 6 percent one side you can 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.270
 choose 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 floats over banks 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 chance the perpetrators 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.690
 you see that and exclusive VAT 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.790
 In addition to having read well, of course, it is 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.229
 anyone can see the exclusive VAT afternoon and here in the d2 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.839
 costs are not a bit like flying every year for discussion 4 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.699
 nothing is possible with a push of a button everything on pigeon man let them live 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.800
 with this button you can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.919
 configure 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.090
 the paraguayan the better brenda make the voter compressed 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.660
 and not only see the rules 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.180
 that have been entered so that you can print easily if you want to enter far 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.180
 put your learning on a full 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.009
 Go live that quarter view 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.009
 then to see what happened to this and the side 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.569
 in that quarter you can do it yourself 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.389
 see that quarter in line I ask myself 2 and that's good at all 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.819
 empty 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.729
 because my quarter 2 have not yet entered 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.369
 I say no really 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 and information comes back 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.059
 who is illegal 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.079
 is 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.039
 Human 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.869
 r had fallen 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:21.939
 give look 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.739
 that it put nothing on cas camps 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.739
 points 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.120
 this time 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.269
 because that 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.079
 the characters appears 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.079
 the editors everything is out of cash per bank 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.959
 and d day the day 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 and everything broken down by categories 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.269
 here they are counted 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.879
 pay more for the costs 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.029
 This tragedy is needed to 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.279
 the VAT return 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.279
 to do at the end of the quarter 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 that year is actually the same 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.109
 only that gives an overview of the three years 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.779
 he just told me the basic functions 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.299
 the program 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.740
 I choose this myself for a certain category not for one hundred 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.360
 percent deductible 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.969
 the two of you 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.569
 you can indeed put things in it 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.599
 You can say that I give up again 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.939
 he can also set you or the category 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.930
 and 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.830
 one hundred percent always agree 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.830
 if you change these percentages a lot, then ask for a book value 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 I look to tell more about it 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.660
 but sp'er suggested business space that you are here but that is 50 percent 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.610
 deductible 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.939
 for some reason 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.439
 I changed from 50 percent 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.529
 and now then we prove that the magazine quarter changes some holes 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.110
 percentages are shown 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.110
 jesus is no more than one percent with 50 percent 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.020
 this is unchanged 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.740
 but the 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.870
 total column has come here 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.620
 you just have to add everything up in the normal way 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.230
 but here is only added by lot but distributed 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.900
 jesper van der wheels of business premises 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.069
 that only 50 percent per year 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.629
 the total costs are also low in this case 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.669
 what does he think this video is about 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.169
 for something between p i have the program free to download from the website
