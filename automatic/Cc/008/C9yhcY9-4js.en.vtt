hi<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.840> when<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.709> most<00:00:01.920> interesting

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hi this is when of the most interesting

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.640 
hi this is when of the most interesting
video<00:00:02.850> in<00:00:03.030> Pascal's<00:00:03.540> triangle<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:04.380> we<00:00:04.620> are

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
video in Pascal's triangle here we are

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.190 
video in Pascal's triangle here we are
going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.069> find<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.730> pattern<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.720> Pascal's

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
going to find a pattern in this Pascal's

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.230 
going to find a pattern in this Pascal's
triangle<00:00:07.440> by<00:00:07.950> coloring<00:00:08.340> all<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.760> hexagons

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
triangle by coloring all the hexagons

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
triangle by coloring all the hexagons
containing<00:00:09.750> odd<00:00:09.929> numbers<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.679> triangle

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
containing odd numbers in this triangle

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.390 
containing odd numbers in this triangle
so<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.030> called<00:00:12.330> sierpinski<00:00:13.400> triangle

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
so this is called sierpinski triangle

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.849 
so this is called sierpinski triangle
pattern<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:15.000> fractals<00:00:15.780> fractals<00:00:16.740> are

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
pattern or fractals fractals are

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
pattern or fractals fractals are
actually<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.670> pattern<00:00:18.270> repeating<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.900> itself

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
actually a pattern repeating in itself

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.679 
actually a pattern repeating in itself
so<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> triangle<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.210> cover<00:00:21.449> all

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so this is a triangle and if I cover all

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
so this is a triangle and if I cover all
the<00:00:21.900> hexagons<00:00:22.380> containing<00:00:22.920> odd<00:00:23.100> numbers<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the hexagons containing odd numbers you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
the hexagons containing odd numbers you
are<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> find<00:00:24.960> tiny<00:00:25.650> tiny<00:00:26.039> triangles<00:00:26.699> in

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
are going to find tiny tiny triangles in

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
are going to find tiny tiny triangles in
this<00:00:27.480> Pascal's<00:00:28.170> triangle<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.099> let<00:00:29.310> me<00:00:29.460> color

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
this Pascal's triangle so let me color

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910 
this Pascal's triangle so let me color
all<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> odd<00:00:30.210> numbers<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> see

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
all the odd numbers and as you can see

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
all the odd numbers and as you can see
till<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.329> noted<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.170> Pascal's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
till here I have noted down the Pascal's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
till here I have noted down the Pascal's
triangle<00:00:34.860> properly<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> after<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
triangle properly and after that I have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
triangle properly and after that I have
just<00:00:36.989> written<00:00:37.260> whether<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> number<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.190> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
just written whether the number will be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.150 
just written whether the number will be
even<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:39.059> odd<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.860> only

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
even or odd because here we are only

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.369 
even or odd because here we are only
interested<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> whether<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> number<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> even

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
interested in whether the number is even

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
interested in whether the number is even
or<00:00:43.680> odd<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:45.020> filled<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> triangle

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
or odd so I have filled the triangle

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.860 
or odd so I have filled the triangle
with<00:00:46.710> O<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.950> E<00:00:47.430> where<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.000> stands<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.690> odd

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
with O and E where all stands for odd

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
with O and E where all stands for odd
number<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> E<00:00:49.590> stands<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.280> even<00:00:50.700> number<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
number and E stands for even number and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.540 
number and E stands for even number and
what<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> am<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.350> next<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.100> am<00:00:53.219> going

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
what I am going to do next is I am going

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
what I am going to do next is I am going
to<00:00:53.670> color<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.510> odd<00:00:54.660> numbers<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:55.440> dark

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
to color all the odd numbers with dark

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.349 
to color all the odd numbers with dark
gray<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> color<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.940> these<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> odd

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
gray so if I color it these are the odd

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.170 
gray so if I color it these are the odd
number<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> odd<00:01:01.350> number<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:02.579> then

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
number one is the odd number right then

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329 
number one is the odd number right then
we<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.359> three<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> odd<00:01:04.949> number

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
we have three which is the odd number

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
we have three which is the odd number
then<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.950> we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
then we have one one over here then we

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.130 
then we have one one over here then we
have<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.400> five<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> odd<00:01:10.049> number<00:01:10.409> right

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
have one five is the odd number right

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.910 
have one five is the odd number right
see<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> am<00:01:13.409> curling<00:01:13.680> only<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> odd<00:01:14.670> numbers<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
see I am curling only the odd numbers in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.140 
see I am curling only the odd numbers in
this<00:01:16.920> pattern<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
this pattern and if you see in this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.120 
this pattern and if you see in this
particular<00:01:21.360> row<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.890> numbers

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
particular row we have all the numbers

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
particular row we have all the numbers
are<00:01:26.130> odd<00:01:26.369> numbers<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> tiny

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
are odd numbers so we have got a tiny

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
are odd numbers so we have got a tiny
triangle<00:01:28.680> over<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.070> yes<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> an<00:01:30.119> inverted

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
triangle over here yes it is an inverted

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.770 
triangle over here yes it is an inverted
triangle<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.130> continue<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.540> are

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
triangle and if I continue this we are

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
triangle and if I continue this we are
going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:35.280> interesting<00:01:35.430> pattern

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
going to get a very interesting pattern

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
going to get a very interesting pattern
which<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.630> full<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> triangles<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
which will be full of triangles so in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
which will be full of triangles so in
this<00:01:38.400> row<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:39.060> only<00:01:39.420> these<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.320> odd

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this row we have only these two odd

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.300 
this row we have only these two odd
numbers<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.520> row<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.180> these

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
numbers then in this row we have these

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
numbers then in this row we have these
four<00:01:44.310> odd<00:01:44.520> numbers<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.570> 45<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
four odd numbers then we have 45 this is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.700 
four odd numbers then we have 45 this is
an<00:01:46.890> odd<00:01:47.009> number<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.079> colored<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
an odd number so I have colored all the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
an odd number so I have colored all the
odd<00:01:49.890> numbers<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.509> can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
odd numbers and now if you see you can

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.499 
odd numbers and now if you see you can
find<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.409> big<00:01:52.950> triangle<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.759> actually

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
find that this big triangle is actually

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770 
find that this big triangle is actually
made<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.159> small<00:01:56.159> small<00:01:56.780> inverted

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
made up of small small inverted

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590 
made up of small small inverted
triangles<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.460> them<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.820> equilateral

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
