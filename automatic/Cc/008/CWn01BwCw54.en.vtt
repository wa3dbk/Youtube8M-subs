00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
what I'm gonna do with these a little

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.510 
what I'm gonna do with these a little
later<00:01:05.780> but<00:01:06.820> right<00:01:07.820> now<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.030> need<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:09.430> get<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
later but right now I need to get the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.280 
later but right now I need to get the
mink<00:01:10.670> oil<00:01:10.790> liquify

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:37.280 

maybe<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:18.950> shift

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:53.830 

not<00:01:38.290> sure<00:01:38.500> if<00:01:38.590> it's<00:01:38.710> gonna<00:01:38.800> stay<00:01:39.100> lit

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840 

probably<00:01:54.840> help<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.260> was<00:01:55.440> not<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.430> exposed

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
probably help if I was not so exposed

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.280 
probably help if I was not so exposed
here<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.560> think<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.860> work<00:01:58.950> though<00:02:00.290> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
here I think that's gonna work though so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
here I think that's gonna work though so
we'll<00:02:01.350> let<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.650> go<00:02:01.890> until<00:02:02.330> till<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.390> gets

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
we'll let this go until till it gets

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.080 
we'll let this go until till it gets
liquefied<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> I'll<00:02:04.260> check<00:02:04.440> back<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:06.470> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
liquefied and I'll check back in and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.770 
liquefied and I'll check back in and
hindsight<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> probably<00:02:09.210> should<00:02:09.570> have<00:02:09.600> taken

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
hindsight I probably should have taken

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.100 
hindsight I probably should have taken
some<00:02:09.990> out<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> little<00:02:12.990> bit

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
some out you can see like a little bit

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.620 
some out you can see like a little bit
of<00:02:13.790> spillage<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.820> melted

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
of spillage but I think that's melted

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
of spillage but I think that's melted
enough<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.320> our<00:02:19.650> purposes<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.430> who's<00:02:21.060> gonna

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
enough for our purposes so who's gonna

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.920 
enough for our purposes so who's gonna
put<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.630> here<00:02:22.670> look<00:02:23.750> hopefully<00:02:24.750> without

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
put it out here look hopefully without

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.690 
put it out here look hopefully without
burning<00:02:25.110> myself<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:29.160> leave<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:29.640> a

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.429 

I'll<00:03:42.090> make<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> feel<00:03:42.510> here<00:03:42.749> and<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.079> we'll<00:03:43.200> try

I'll make a feel here and then we'll try

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:52.149 
I'll make a feel here and then we'll try
it<00:03:43.469> out<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.599> end<00:03:48.780> result<00:03:49.370> it's

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159

kind<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.189> slight<00:03:54.170> it's<00:03:55.170> like<00:03:55.379> greasy<00:03:55.859> feeling

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
kind of slight it's like greasy feeling

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:04.160 
kind of slight it's like greasy feeling
to<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:58.969> but<00:03:59.969> not<00:04:00.689> too<00:04:00.900> bad<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.019> they

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170
