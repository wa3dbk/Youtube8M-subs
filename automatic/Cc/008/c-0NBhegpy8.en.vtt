00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
brand-new ship and I would put her up

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.800 
brand-new ship and I would put her up
against<00:00:20.250> any<00:00:20.460> ship<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> fleet<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.480> terms

against any ship in the fleet in terms
of<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.259> from<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.980> ship<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.759> was<00:00:23.939> maybe<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
of going from a ship that was maybe a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.179 
of going from a ship that was maybe a
little<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:24.900> mature<00:00:25.110> in<00:00:25.410> her<00:00:25.529> age<00:00:25.740> to

little bit more mature in her age to
absolutely<00:00:26.730> looking<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> brand-new<00:00:27.630> ship

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
absolutely looking like a brand-new ship

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.500 
absolutely looking like a brand-new ship
it<00:00:28.770> was<00:00:28.860> an<00:00:28.980> opportunity<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.759> us<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> change

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it was an opportunity for us to change

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
it was an opportunity for us to change
the<00:00:30.689> look<00:00:30.869> -<00:00:31.019> change<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.350> field<00:00:31.680> got<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> much

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the look - change the field got a much

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.549 
the look - change the field got a much
fresher<00:00:32.550> contemporary<00:00:33.390> look<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.470> I<00:00:34.530> think

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
fresher contemporary look and I think

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
fresher contemporary look and I think
we've<00:00:34.830> done<00:00:34.949> that<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.190> successfully<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
we've done that very successfully and it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
we've done that very successfully and it
seems<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.900> be<00:00:37.019> a<00:00:37.050> big<00:00:37.530> hit<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.400> same<00:00:38.460> time

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
seems to be a big hit at the same time

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
seems to be a big hit at the same time
within<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.449> stateroom<00:00:40.290> part<00:00:40.620> changing<00:00:41.610> the

tidying up the furniture and adding the

tidying up the furniture and adding the
flat-screen<00:00:47.309> TV<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.450> also<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.960> line<00:00:49.200> with

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
flat-screen TV is is also in line with

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229
