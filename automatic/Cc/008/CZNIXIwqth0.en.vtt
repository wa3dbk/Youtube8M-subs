00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 in the morning we are in a new video 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 and the installation of the earthquakes 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.959
 install 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.000
 and maximum install are the installers of 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.449
 the mod that good that as its name what 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.070
 indica are very very easy to install 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.920
 they simply settle with a kind 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.859
 of the launcher in which we are going to make 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.439
 a click on the button called install 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 and it will install us automatically 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.930
 without any complication of opening 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.030
 guys these mod or is this launcher 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.890
 they come already by default with the forge the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
 which is going to be too 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.630
 it's automatically worth it so nothing is going 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 to download for example any mode 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.550
 of this video will serve as an example 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.710
 for any installation so nothing 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 let's download for example any 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.550
 come on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.100
 and let's make any mod 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.050
 let's get down to let them down here 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 to always download the version that you put 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.440
 excel we give you a click worth where you put 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 double 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.540
 exe always this very important version 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.220
 in the exe version the cip is manual is 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.900
 much more difficult is not that it's much 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.210
 more but it's more complicated we're going to 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.680
 download the one that you put points and once 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.900
 downloaded if we will have one 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.300
 kind of let's see what is open 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.430
 minecraft is going to download us 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.119
 kind of installer which we are going to 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.119
 double click 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.179
 let's see if this is already open 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.679
 let's double click as you see us 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.930
 We leave in default forging and we give in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.680
 install mod 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.200
 well here it tells us that it is not open 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.570
 that we close it as you see is a pretty 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.160
 is a very complete launcher that 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 indicates all the faults that may have 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.540
 all once closed we give you sight 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.979

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.110

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.640

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.200
 will start to download 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.119
 I did not download it and it's going to start 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 install it as elche with the super 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.979

 we can give it to an install mod and it 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.920
 will uninstall automatically today I'm going 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 start leave all settings 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
