00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.280 
do want to get agility or hunter and I
actually<00:02:00.580> thought<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.390> uh<00:02:01.450> there<00:02:02.260> I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
actually thought of this uh there I

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.750 
actually thought of this uh there I
didn't<00:02:02.740> think<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:03.160> but<00:02:03.400> there's<00:02:03.670> this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
didn't think of this but there's this

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.090 
didn't think of this but there's this
method<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.450> doing<00:02:04.840> hunter<00:02:05.290> which<00:02:05.470> also<00:02:05.680> trains

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
method of doing hunter which also trains

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.430 
method of doing hunter which also trains
your<00:02:06.250> jelly<00:02:06.520> at<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.760> same<00:02:07.090> time<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.750> thought

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
your jelly at the same time I thought

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.320 
your jelly at the same time I thought
that<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.770> pretty<00:02:08.979> cool<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> might<00:02:10.119> try<00:02:10.239> that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
that was pretty cool so I might try that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.050 
that was pretty cool so I might try that
out<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.320> method<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.800> doing<00:02:12.370> barehanded

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
out and the method is doing barehanded

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.710 
out and the method is doing barehanded
