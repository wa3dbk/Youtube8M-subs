00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.090
 no this is not time for a new copy and if i lima anp 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.839
 agents there we were exactly exactly anyway 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.830
 today i'm going to show you that you also have a paddling pool in editions church 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:13.460
 we he 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.880
 no agreements have been made and therefore simply 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.079
 the British 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.749
 and if your google sync terminal is this year 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:25.490
 and the interior and ICT system is one and systems and peanut butter r are therefore over 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.860
 at 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.769
 the worse may sound a bit no combinations 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.109
 but well it is not for nothing in America so popular 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.280
 and got to work with it and picked valleys and start making it 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.249
 the bottom of the system in every installment of the processor 105 grams 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:41.350
 basse cakes 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.790
 pinas done on Wednesday afternoon 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 a thick in that connection with 10 for extra flavor with salt is just very bad 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 nice you can not have them at home then you can also be 11 2 11 5 of them 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.470
 use book 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.920
 pechtold processor event driven that can use this well 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.680
 in the meantime I have put 100 grams of butter in a saucepan and can turn quickly 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 top layer 4 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.110
 that is completely melted and the cake msm 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 the device would look like one of the horses 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.550
 you can still see a few whole half of this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.010
 in amersfoort but that is fine and that is so good for the broadcast 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.180
 of good faith tells what you have 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.210
 that is higher 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210
 in arnhem that is the increase in melted butter 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.050
 around four o 'clock 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.210
 and this involves just about all eyes were covered with a layer of boats 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 the intention is that the banks start the cac well together 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.840
 2 like the first child who wants to stay that has me 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.560
 it does not really have a little bit of pain and stress 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 I am not 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 quite a bit or way too long 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 I will imagine that with a stabbing I have a stone's throw of 28 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.560
 centimeters in diameter 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 that debate I have a layer of fry the chicken fillet 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 this promotion time easy to unsubscribe and go out 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.969
 most important factors 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.610
 how crazy can recognize and too little when people with a diameter of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.060
 nearly 10 percent said they were purchasing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 some extra publicity and then it's good 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.699
 leaving is the system is as a supplement 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.779
 That does not always make it yellow 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.239
 shame those vacations say 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.049
 there are still good maintenance times this week in the fridge 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.990
 improved between March and March 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.960
 they are also getting their government cooled down enough to continue 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.069
 start 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.769
 Twello the police sees ekin that according to afmp fnv it doesn't matter and we have 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.710
 naturally cream cheese 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.139
 who has 450 grams of residence 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.099
 but i thought i didnt bother about the taste though 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.559
 is it an end to a diamond or something like that 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.019
 but most ladies from primary school t 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.559
 with that comes the name of the baby called there may not be me either 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.689
 9 she was there the first time we were all with an electronic ankle strap 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.629
 that's really not hey 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.260
 a lower lick a few laps by button so that I am well breezy and softer 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
 and that was good for the rest of the ingredients 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.569
 the climb they look there apparently no slavery is a bit less beautiful needed 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.719
 as you can see 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.560
 now it's time to add the peanut butter and use 350 grams of delicate 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.899
 seems a lot but good you go of course this chase did not alone 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.309
 deliver 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.309
 and put into use handle in the greenhouse of the pieces 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.699
 and that there is a fight on Tuesday morning, so let's not take it 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.300
 then it is nice if you just 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.300
 very smooth mixture 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 and currently salad and in baarn the baarnse that 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.679
 I would like to have my chance to be well absorbed 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.679
 and that in a light brown and so on 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.369
 but as you can see, however, very nice light brown wish from last year 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.419
 almost finished 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.620
 but those that have been left behind have added the latest ingredients 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
 I follow a teaspoon of piano marathon 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.650
 then I start from 25 grams 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.729
 pooley business trips 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.850
 and it really is one they don't care about this system 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.960
 Veenendaal 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.809
 and that will probably not get started 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.860
 but of course we let this a few hours' journey really 

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.919
 very nice smooth mixture 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.409
 then we can start this immediately on the sprint 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.139
 i see i dont think these 8 come disgusting seems real 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.140
 Monday evening will also be at the workplace 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.840
 but to be good 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.099
 then I will not enter the system in this system 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.879
 players get 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.349
 the robbery was broadcast between had come 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.529
 it all right 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:07.230
 well if that was possible 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.419
 but with a little behind 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.539
 calculated 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.159
 faithful 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.159
 i can't say i just twello 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.789
 Critically looking at any nasty case I got completely out of the paint 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.439
 a question 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.099
 this is not to be trusted at all in his home in the fridge 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.620
 unfortunately literary a little longer 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.890
 the system has taken off well at least once in a while this winter 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.699
 that is also the only layer of jumping over it and that is this year we are one 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.189
 Day Crazier Door Pins in Berlin are the system feature days in the fridge 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:43.550
 let alone 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.489
 a steady rain rubbed with the lowest nmbs that really true 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.449
 get there 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.449
 I have four pieces of cut film events 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.600
 so good 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.860
 and I signed a little bit of the mixture and that of one yesterday 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.460
 aso the tastiest can hardly wait to do 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.460
 I'm going now because 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.129
 perfect well that 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.069
 and it's always on hold 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.069
 van den berg this requires a monastery 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.830
 however, flea market and basta first travel companion kpn subscription within limits 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360
 system 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.580
 i think i restore if you still fail to let us know alone 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.800
 tastiest 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.389
 if you are engaged from bite back ups of the crisis again 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.969
 also the homemade ones 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.930
 what I did anyway super nice is a night flare up 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.930
 offering pedersen in addition to the sweetness of the cia 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.229
 after all, Achterberg said Monday 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.819
 geer work in a very large city and will in any case know in ten 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:02.609
 That said a spokesman of seeing that questions have been addressed 

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.300
 excelsior but my columns 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.970
 it is not up to me to always keep my name up to date with the very latest 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.789
 videos well you can also have visits 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.139
 on the other hand, I will deal with it 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.399
 the argentine and villa on the famous gun
