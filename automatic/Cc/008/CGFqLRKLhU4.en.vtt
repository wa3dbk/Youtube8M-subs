do first attack the same string same

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.880 
do first attack the same string same
note<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.570> instead<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> sliding<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:46.770> going

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
note but instead of sliding we're going

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.130 
note but instead of sliding we're going
to<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.070> ahead<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.460> press<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.360> our

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
want to bend up but the basics are keep

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.240 
want to bend up but the basics are keep
this<00:02:12.110> finger<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.739> finger<00:02:13.040> close

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
this finger and this finger close

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.810 
this finger and this finger close
together<00:02:13.430> for<00:02:13.850> support<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:18.130> our<00:02:19.130> last

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
together for support and then our last

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.539 
together for support and then our last
technique<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.450> when<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:20.630> called<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> vibrato

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
technique is when we called the vibrato

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.410 
technique is when we called the vibrato
vibrato<00:02:22.549> is<00:02:22.700> another<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.360> those

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
vibrato is another one of those

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
vibrato is another one of those
techniques<00:02:23.810> takes<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.320> while<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.709> get<00:02:24.860> down<00:02:25.100> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
techniques takes a while to get down and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
techniques takes a while to get down and
finesse<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:26.000> once<00:02:26.180> you've<00:02:26.329> got<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.540> you've

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
finesse but once you've got it you've
