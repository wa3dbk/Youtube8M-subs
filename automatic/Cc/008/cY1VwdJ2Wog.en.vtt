00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
middle so it kind of does have like a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.040 
middle so it kind of does have like a
transition<00:03:31.470> until<00:03:31.709> like<00:03:31.859> dark<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.489> light<00:03:32.700> and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
transition until like dark to light and
