00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 good guys how good are you here 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 we are in the bounce bounces if it bounces 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 bounces guys after practically 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 One year many asked me because I wanted 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 to go back to the channel so we're going to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.639
 play a game and we 'll see what 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 such but this moment is a way that already 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.320
 you know that it is bad enough 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 with the crossbow is still ballistic and this 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.289
 mode is basically that because I do not know 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.760
 how the milk was finished killing that and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.279
 this politician 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.060
 we go 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.060
 OK OK 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.690
 as a kid I do not understand it because 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.430
 people do that I understand that you stay 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.320
 no bullets and you throw that to me but god and if 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.519
 you have bullets but good for that is for 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.650
 that's why also the points in 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.090
 reality 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.520
 well take I also go to blade 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.210
 ah 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.210
 eye 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.009
 actually stabbing does not matter because 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.059
 basically I have points instead of 10 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.619
 is trying to get the 10 out there 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.909
 points you put a knife and says 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.659
 good 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.659
 and back 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.810
 I do not have anything else I 'm sorry but I do not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.330
 I have bullets without ammunition without curse 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.380
 as of 81 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.380
 OK OK 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.390
 this is where the people are what they usually 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 to always be playing, what if 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 you want to arrive you have seen in several 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 occasions because basically they kill me 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.250
 in the end 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.250
 year 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:52.500
 and today I ended up in a grave that comes 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.980
 we will recharge your help in a bloody one 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.760
 damn spike 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.710
 where I was in here is worth not because 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.400
 they do not give me for those who have to throw 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.630
 more and I have to pick them up and this is 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.830
 I think you have to throw them away I have to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.900
 pick them up if I'm not wrong 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.700
 If not, they do not give me the plan to kill the 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.860
 hunger could give you some scavenger 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.130
 previous would not be wrong in this mode of 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130
 carrion 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.230
 let's see 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.930
