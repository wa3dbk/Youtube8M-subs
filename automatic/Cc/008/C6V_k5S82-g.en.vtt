00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.029
 Welcome to our 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.410
 press conference after the bundesliga 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.439
 play borussia dortmund against the sc 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.570
 Paderborn I welcome both trainers and 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.240
 please andré breitreiter around his 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.529
 Comment on the game, yes, first of all 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.019
 Congratulations to Jürgen and his 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.849
 team to the ultimate absolute 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.879
 deserved victory even at height 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.199
 three to zero we think we really are 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.080
 got into the game very well 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.620
 in the first 30 35 minutes we have 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.239
 very compact defended the opponent 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.989
 Goals chances are very difficult 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.850
 earn 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.809
 the guys did exactly what they did 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.220
 we wanted to run ourselves strong 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.909
 powerful and also with needle-sticks 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.400
 forward 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.199
 if you are here in dortmund then what 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.330
 then you want to take with you 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.879
 certainly also a bit of luck and luck 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.879
 sometimes a real decision 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.860
 we have today if I have the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.880
 Season see if the seven clear 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 did not get eleven meters 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 It was a very clear eleven meters at Uwe 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.560
 hünemeier the pictures seen yes then 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.590
 Maybe we'll give the lead 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.210
 and the game can be different 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.800
 after the break, we wanted in the reason 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.440
 Do it the same way as in the first 30 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.290
 35 minutes but rather by a 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.020
 inconsistency on the side we have in the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.840
 detail made mistakes and the single 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 admitted and yes after that was the was 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.100
 express the bvb unstoppable one 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.360
 team with high quality there it went 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.620
 a bit too fast for us too 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.780
 you have to say that clearly 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.490
 and therefore the result was later 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.930
 Finally, due to the many number 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.620
 the bullet shots also earned in the height 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.530
 thank you andré breitrain for andre 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.320
 Breitreiter needs so much time 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.100
 any comment on the game please me 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.270
 was not at the first half 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.479
 dissatisfied i have the boys in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.830
 Half-time exactly that's what 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.830
 usually the problem is that one 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.560
 if you do not respect paderborn 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.659
 then one is surprised that it is one 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.650
 hard for a while 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.840
 we did that well we did 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.759
 We have had degrees 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.830
 not the clearest in the world but us 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.959
 have not worked paderborn 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.549
 is then in Umschaltspiel always quite 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 dangerous standard situation anyway 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.209
 Or you can tell from the size 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.650
 but they have a lot of superiority 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.670
 well done that was important to us 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.470
 half past time with a good one 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 feel free to go out because we only have a few 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.920
 Things hardly had to change between them 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.060
 the chains only played half-time 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.250
 Chinese too little in the boat 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.720
 taken and not yet pressing 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.580
 really present enough and have 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.319
 Of course not fast enough publishers 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.800
 because the opponents very far that engages 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.120
 I'll be fine if we can do that 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.310
 allow that even in the narrow space 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.260
 second half we play then 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.300
 with the shift , the better 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 have done the right good timing 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.260
 that was done and that is how the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.150
 formation by moving and then it is 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.470
 normal that sometime the distances 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 no longer agree that mistakes happen 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.769
 that will be that 1 0 of course 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 we had needed before that 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.870
 A great opportunity by Micki the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.130
 if a research goal had been made 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.660
 probably not the ball either 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.850
 shoots directly but just takes along 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.560
 being completely free then he can 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.100
 with his yard in the long corner 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.890
 shoot 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.580
 so it was our turn the button went to the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.170
 Boys then work well 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.819
 free and then have football properly 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.610
 he played really well without it 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:28.569
 to let something be highly defended 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.569
 Well done and well deserved 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.370
 if you do not get them but we have 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.549
 I think even made one that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.900
 no offside was so accordingly 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.780
 then over 90 minutes were seen stop 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.010
 Earnings saw us super important 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.370
 super important fact 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.840
 six-point game and won 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.870
 accordingly, his andrä feels 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.100
 and sc paderborn all the best for the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.100
 next games and
