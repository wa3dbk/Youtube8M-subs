00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 no we do not care to Nancy their 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.580
 side the Cannes people want to exceed 15 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.660
 winless matches need to win 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 for both teams 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 theatrical twist in tree maybe the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 fastest goal in football history 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630
 8 seconds to score michele riot 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.439
 volley in full race the man dussuyer 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 a goal full of opportunism 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.180
 the cannois have not yet touched 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.180
 ball 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 no doubt the stadium weed caen 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.840
 will make the difference very quickly 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.090
 difficult to do faster 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.190
 from then on, caen's pressing is 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 standing the defense of the can cannes is 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.950
 taken in the throat 30th minute when double 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.020
 setting 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.540
 super the service of gaulle land for 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.989
 stéphane straw that cheat 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 new shreds it's the 11th goal of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 payet 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.170
 a minute later it still heats 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.280
 on the Cannes side but the ball ends 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 just above the crossbar 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.980
 and then just before half-time or 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.910
 francs for ace cannes it's hasanovic 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.320
 he pulls it and it goes over 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.940
 mountain and cane goals will not find 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 never the flaw in the defense 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.510
 Caen in first half 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 half time it will change cannes attack 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 relentlessly hasanovic there in extremis 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.690
 a Caen player will have to wait 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.440
 10 minutes to see robin hangers 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.729
 returned at half-time save the honor 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.979
 launched by fernandez two luxembourgish 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.040
 cross his shot montanier nothing 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.040
 make 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 I think we did a very good 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.729
 second half unfortunately did not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.000
 scored a goal and I understand you a 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.469
 third goal Caen litigious enough 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.149
 but i thought we approve rda 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.829
 half-time we are able to react and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.100
 I hope that soon we will come back 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.140
 sir the third goal caennais is 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
 yet limpid chain meeting in super 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.319
 form scored his second goal and surrendered 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 the clocks at the normal time in 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:08.310
 three canes a luis fernandez the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.959
 captain canoe after getting a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.459
 yellow card commits a foul on benoît 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.430
 caouette 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.049
 louis turns and strikes left 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.269
 expulsion yes for joel quiniou who goes out 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.260
 the red card 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.069
 essential football character 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 French where he leaves the field 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 yet at ten against eleven this canvas 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.260
 to make the show heats up in the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 mountain goals and defenders 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.120
 caennais are always well placed to 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.950
 to supplement their guardians lack of 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.400
 success Cannes will not come back 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.209
 to score 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.470
 the norm we find the smile very 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 offensive to a lot of action 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.840
 we've found ourselves a few times 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.330
 but we find appropriate who are going to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.390
 find good it lasts 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.390
 what
