the<00:00:20.789> moves<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.359> level<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:23.330> forward

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the moves in this level are forward

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.560 
the moves in this level are forward
stroking<00:00:24.980> basic<00:00:25.980> stop<00:00:26.449> swizzles

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
stroking basic stop swizzles

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.490 
stroking basic stop swizzles
and<00:00:27.689> backwards<00:00:28.439> skating<00:00:29.480> let's<00:00:30.480> begin<00:00:33.500> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and backwards skating let's begin this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
and backwards skating let's begin this
is<00:00:34.739> forward<00:00:35.010> stroking<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> begin<00:00:36.630> it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is forward stroking but to begin it's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.610 
is forward stroking but to begin it's
generally<00:00:37.739> easiest<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.620> marching

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
generally easiest to do this marching

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
generally easiest to do this marching
it's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> same<00:00:42.000> march<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:42.750> office

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it's the same march as you would office

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's the same march as you would office
much<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.710> imitating<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.489> soldier<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
much like imitating a soldier and it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.910 
much like imitating a soldier and it
should<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> comfortable<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.500> being<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
should get you comfortable with being on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.299 
should get you comfortable with being on
the<00:00:46.950> ice<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> standing<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.860> once<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.190> do

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the ice and standing up once you can do

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
the ice and standing up once you can do
this<00:00:50.489> you'll<00:00:50.879> progress<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.960> glide

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this you'll progress to more of a glide

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
this you'll progress to more of a glide
and<00:00:52.590> slide<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.910> march<00:00:54.180> but

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and slide in which you will march but

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.270 
and slide in which you will march but
instead<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.260> picking<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.070> feet

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
instead of just picking up your feet

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
instead of just picking up your feet
you'll<00:00:56.879> push<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:57.719> behind<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you'll push them a little behind as you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.189 
you'll push them a little behind as you
go<00:00:58.859> forward<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.570> once<00:01:00.570> you've<00:01:00.750> gained<00:01:01.050> an

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
go forward and once you've gained an

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
go forward and once you've gained an
amount<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.680> speed<00:01:01.949> you're<00:01:02.160> comfortable<00:01:02.670> with

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
amount of speed you're comfortable with

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
amount of speed you're comfortable with
you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.480> glide

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.450 

a<00:01:11.899> key<00:01:12.899> tip<00:01:13.109> you<00:01:13.289> can<00:01:13.439> use<00:01:13.619> while<00:01:13.859> skating<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

you<00:01:19.109> with<00:01:19.140> power<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.799> most<00:01:20.039> importantly<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you with power but most importantly it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
you with power but most importantly it
will<00:01:20.789> help<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.090> keep<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.450> balance<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:22.670> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
will help you keep your balance as you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
will help you keep your balance as you
progress<00:01:23.939> further<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.959> will<00:01:25.079> be<00:01:25.259> doing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
my right and push it out in front and to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.629 
my right and push it out in front and to
the<00:02:21.660> same<00:02:21.959> side<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.130> needs<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.549> be

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
the same side of you this needs to be

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.670 
the same side of you this needs to be
forceful<00:02:24.060> otherwise<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.989> won't<00:02:25.079> stop<00:02:25.470> you'll

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
forceful otherwise you won't stop you'll

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.670 
forceful otherwise you won't stop you'll
simply<00:02:25.889> slow<00:02:26.250> down<00:02:26.599> but<00:02:27.599> also<00:02:27.900> gradual<00:02:28.500> if

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
simply slow down but also gradual if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.379 
simply slow down but also gradual if
it's<00:02:28.980> extremely<00:02:29.519> sudden<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.000> may<00:02:30.180> knock

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
it's extremely sudden you may knock

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.869 
it's extremely sudden you may knock
yourself<00:02:30.810> over

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.369

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
stopping like all aspects of skating

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.349 
stopping like all aspects of skating
takes<00:02:39.650> practice<00:02:40.099> but<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.609> crucial<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.239> you

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
takes practice but it is crucial and you

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.050 
takes practice but it is crucial and you
will<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:41.659> it<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:43.519> struggle<00:02:44.030> with

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
will get it if you struggle with

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.240 
will get it if you struggle with
stopping<00:02:44.659> it<00:02:44.840> helps<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.379> hold<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> wall

and in out in out in now to the final
move<00:03:35.200> backwards<00:03:36.200> skating<00:03:38.409> it<00:03:39.459> might<00:03:40.459> seem

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
move backwards skating it might seem

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.759 
move backwards skating it might seem
tricky<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.389> like<00:03:41.810> all<00:03:41.989> figure<00:03:42.260> skating<00:03:42.530> moves

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
tricky but like all figure skating moves

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.490 
tricky but like all figure skating moves
it<00:03:43.129> gets<00:03:43.370> better<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:43.790> easier<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.299> practice

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
it gets better and easier with practice

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.990 
it gets better and easier with practice
the<00:03:45.500> easiest<00:03:45.859> way<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.159> begin<00:03:46.400> backwards

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the easiest way to begin backwards

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.449 
the easiest way to begin backwards
skating<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.750> through<00:03:48.019> backwards<00:03:48.470> whizzes<00:03:48.859> all

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
skating is through backwards whizzes all

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.020 
skating is through backwards whizzes all
you<00:03:49.729> do<00:03:49.879> are<00:03:50.000> fourpence<00:03:50.359> wizzle's<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.019> reverse

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
you do are fourpence wizzle's in reverse

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.699 
you do are fourpence wizzle's in reverse
so<00:03:53.030> start<00:03:53.389> standing<00:03:53.659> backwards<00:03:54.319> and<00:03:54.470> point

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
so start standing backwards and point

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.580 
so start standing backwards and point
your<00:03:54.829> toes<00:03:55.099> about<00:03:55.430> halfway<00:03:55.699> in<00:03:56.209> now<00:03:57.049> push<00:03:57.379> out

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
your toes about halfway in now push out

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.589 
your toes about halfway in now push out
and<00:03:57.769> once<00:03:58.129> your<00:03:58.340> feet<00:03:58.579> are<00:03:58.699> parallel<00:03:59.180> or<00:03:59.329> your

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
and once your feet are parallel or your

and once your feet are parallel or your
heels<00:03:59.810> are<00:04:00.019> pointing<00:04:00.440> towards<00:04:00.590> each<00:04:00.769> other

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
heels are pointing towards each other

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.509 
heels are pointing towards each other
you<00:04:01.430> push<00:04:01.729> in<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.150> repeat<00:04:03.139> I'll<00:04:04.129> say<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.459> again

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
you push in and repeat I'll say it again

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:13.110 
you push in and repeat I'll say it again
swizzles<00:04:05.359> are<00:04:05.510> just<00:04:05.720> out<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.430> in<00:04:07.430> out<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.900> in

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.670
