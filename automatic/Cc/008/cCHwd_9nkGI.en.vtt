00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hello guys and welcome back to let's

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.700 
hello guys and welcome back to let's
build<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.980> space<00:00:05.460> station<00:00:05.790> now<00:00:06.779> it<00:00:07.020> has<00:00:07.170> been<00:00:07.410> a

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
build a space station now it has been a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.589 
build a space station now it has been a
long<00:00:08.099> while<00:00:08.400> since<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.120> actually

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
long while since I have actually

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.020 
long while since I have actually
uploaded<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.380> these<00:00:10.530> videos<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.910> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
uploaded one of these videos and that is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
uploaded one of these videos and that is
because<00:00:12.330> I've<00:00:12.509> been<00:00:12.540> having<00:00:12.990> some<00:00:13.469> major

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
because I've been having some major

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.029 
because I've been having some major
problems<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.849> build<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.590> was<00:00:16.590> trying<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
problems with this build I was trying to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.269 
problems with this build I was trying to
design<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> system<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.359> had<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.869> spire<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
design a system that had a spire up to a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
design a system that had a spire up to a
higher<00:00:20.609> level<00:00:21.119> than<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.449> docking<00:00:21.810> station<00:00:21.840> from

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
higher level than a docking station from

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.540 
higher level than a docking station from
above<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:24.359> didn't<00:00:24.810> work<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.410> took<00:00:25.740> many

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
above and it didn't work I took many

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
above and it didn't work I took many
many<00:00:26.880> attempts<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.230> work<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.830> just

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
many attempts to make it work and I just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.179 
many attempts to make it work and I just
simply<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.970> get<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.590> wanted<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
simply can get it to do what I wanted it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.940 
simply can get it to do what I wanted it
never<00:00:32.579> quite<00:00:32.940> looked<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> imagined<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> in

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
never quite looked how I imagined it in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
never quite looked how I imagined it in
my<00:00:35.040> head<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.399> wasn't<00:00:35.790> happy<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
my head I just wasn't happy with it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
my head I just wasn't happy with it
so<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.350> ended<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.800> deleting<00:00:38.329> everything<00:00:39.329> I'd

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so I ended up deleting everything I'd

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
so I ended up deleting everything I'd
spent<00:00:39.960> trying<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> build<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.070> given<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.180> on

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
spent trying to build and given up on

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
spent trying to build and given up on
that<00:00:42.480> idea<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> shame<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that idea actually it was a shame but I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
that idea actually it was a shame but I
think<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.600> call<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.899> make

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
think it was the right call to make

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
think it was the right call to make
because<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.860> wouldn't<00:00:47.070> looked<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.579> leaving

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
because it wouldn't looked right leaving

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
because it wouldn't looked right leaving
it<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> way<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.890> least<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it the way that it was or at least I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.990 
it the way that it was or at least I
didn't<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
didn't think so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.470 
didn't think so
so<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.870> you're<00:00:52.050> watching<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.520> design<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so what you're watching is my design of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
so what you're watching is my design of
a<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.469> simple<00:00:56.039> idea<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> docking<00:00:57.270> station

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a more simple idea for a docking station

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.470 
a more simple idea for a docking station
that<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> same

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that is one that is just on the same

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
that is one that is just on the same
plane<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:00.930> we've<00:01:01.410> been<00:01:01.590> building<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
plane as we've been building for all of

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
plane as we've been building for all of
our<00:01:02.670> outer<00:01:02.940> disks<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
our outer disks so you can see I did it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
our outer disks so you can see I did it
as<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.180> arc<00:01:06.840> sort<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> shape<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:09.000> building

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
as an arc sort of shape and I'm building

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.420 
as an arc sort of shape and I'm building
up<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> sidewalls<00:01:10.680> following<00:01:11.159> quite<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
up now the sidewalls following quite a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
up now the sidewalls following quite a
similar<00:01:11.670> house<00:01:11.970> style<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.570> usual<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
similar house style was usual with the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
similar house style was usual with the
second<00:01:14.100> bottom<00:01:14.400> layer<00:01:14.610> being<00:01:15.000> made<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
second bottom layer being made of the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230 
second bottom layer being made of the
copper<00:01:15.960> blocks<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.740> adding<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.729> those<00:01:17.909> two

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
copper blocks and adding in those two

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
copper blocks and adding in those two
high<00:01:18.479> reinforced<00:01:19.200> glass<00:01:19.320> windows<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.759> like

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
high reinforced glass windows just like

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
high reinforced glass windows just like
we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> our<00:01:22.320> disks<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> rims<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
we have on all of our disks and rims and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
we have on all of our disks and rims and
everything<00:01:24.330> we've<00:01:24.479> built<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> far<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.770> we're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
everything we've built so far so we're

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
everything we've built so far so we're
sticking<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.790> much<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> theme<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
sticking very much with the theme that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.390 
sticking very much with the theme that
we've<00:01:27.930> developed<00:01:28.140> throughout<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.040> series

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
we've developed throughout this series

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.560 
we've developed throughout this series
and<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> actually<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and this is actually going to be the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109 
and this is actually going to be the
last<00:01:33.960> episode<00:01:34.310> where<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.430> building<00:01:35.670> there

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
last episode where I'm building there

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990 
last episode where I'm building there
will<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.689> sort<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> showing<00:01:38.130> off<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> final

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
will be a sort of showing off the final

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
will be a sort of showing off the final
product<00:01:39.420> video<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.530> with

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
product video a bit like we did with

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
product video a bit like we did with
Moonglow<00:01:41.909> village<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> remember<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
Moonglow village if you remember that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
Moonglow village if you remember that
but<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> looking<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> get

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
but then we will be looking and to get

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.920 
but then we will be looking and to get
in<00:01:46.320> some<00:01:46.649> new<00:01:46.920> project<00:01:47.520> underway<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.540> I'd<00:01:48.630> love

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in some new project underway so I'd love

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260

should be doing next because I'm gonna

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.280 
should be doing next because I'm gonna
start<00:01:53.850> thinking<00:01:54.149> about<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.840> probably<00:01:55.049> put

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
start thinking about it I probably put

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
start thinking about it I probably put
up<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> video<00:01:55.680> asking<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> vote<00:01:56.880> once<00:01:57.240> I've

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
up a video asking for a vote once I've

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
up a video asking for a vote once I've
got<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> few<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.020> ideas<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:59.340> let<00:01:59.460> me<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.700> if

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
got a few good ideas but let me know if

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.789 
got a few good ideas but let me know if
you've<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.119> any<00:02:00.240> ideas<00:02:00.270> already<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you've got any ideas already so that I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.170 
you've got any ideas already so that I
can<00:02:01.979> start<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.310> ever<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.759> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can start to ever think about that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230 
can start to ever think about that
so<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.350> designing<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.250> actual<00:02:05.670> docking

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
so now designing the actual docking

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
so now designing the actual docking
clamp<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> part<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.649> building<00:02:08.160> which

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
clamp that part of this building which

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150 
clamp that part of this building which
is<00:02:08.489> its<00:02:08.670> main<00:02:09.000> function<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.619> want<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
is its main function and I want this to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
is its main function and I want this to
be<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.610> large<00:02:12.330> cylinder

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be a large cylinder

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.520 
be a large cylinder
out<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> side<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.540> clamp<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
out of the side that would clamp on to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.640 
out of the side that would clamp on to
ships<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:17.160> they<00:02:17.220> were<00:02:17.489> flying<00:02:18.030> close<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.840> wanted

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
ships as they were flying close I wanted

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
ships as they were flying close I wanted
to<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.040> very<00:02:20.730> specifically<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.300> wanted<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to have very specifically I wanted a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.619 
to have very specifically I wanted a
circle<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.440> lamps<00:02:22.830> around<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.459> similar<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
circle of lamps around it similar to the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.470 
circle of lamps around it similar to the
entrance<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.980> inner<00:02:26.459> honor<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.300> have

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
entrance to the inner honor that we have

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.199 
entrance to the inner honor that we have
so<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.410> play<00:02:28.650> around<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.129> few<00:02:29.370> times<00:02:29.430> trying<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
so I play around a few times trying to

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390 
so I play around a few times trying to
get<00:02:30.330> something<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.870> looks<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.769> out

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
get something that looks right with out

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.330 
get something that looks right with out
making<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.970> too<00:02:33.300> large<00:02:33.599> or<00:02:33.870> too<00:02:33.930> small<00:02:34.340> now

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
making it too large or too small now

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.250 
making it too large or too small now
like<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.700> idea<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.030> using<00:02:36.209> reinforce<00:02:36.900> stone

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
like the idea of using reinforce stone

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.550 
like the idea of using reinforce stone
as<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> sort<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.250> air<00:02:38.459> lock<00:02:38.880> type<00:02:39.269> gate<00:02:39.750> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
as a sort of air lock type gate there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
as a sort of air lock type gate there
would<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.799> attached<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> ship<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.629> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
would be attached into the ship so I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.300 
would be attached into the ship so I
play<00:02:42.989> around<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.590> few<00:02:43.769> different<00:02:43.890> frames

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
play around for a few different frames

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.820 
play around for a few different frames
the<00:02:44.489> end<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.819> indenting<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.660> lamps<00:02:46.140> back<00:02:46.470> one

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the end of indenting the lamps back one

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370 
the end of indenting the lamps back one
into<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> same<00:02:47.519> lever<00:02:47.849> layer<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:48.989> dog

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
into the same lever layer as the dog

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.650 
into the same lever layer as the dog
batter<00:02:49.620> blocks<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.280> end<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.880> very<00:02:51.180> happy<00:02:51.540> with

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
batter blocks I end up very happy with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.059 
batter blocks I end up very happy with
how<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.870> Luke<00:02:52.230> someone<00:02:52.650> knows<00:02:52.799> from<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
how that Luke someone knows from the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.280 
how that Luke someone knows from the
splashing<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.670> little<00:02:53.910> bit<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> copper<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
splashing a little bit of copper just to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
splashing a little bit of copper just to
add<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.410> bit<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.860> color<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.549> I'm<00:02:56.760> quite

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
add that bit of color and I'm quite

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.809 
add that bit of color and I'm quite
happy<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.370> come<00:02:59.700> around

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
happy with that so then I come around

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.509 
happy with that so then I come around
and<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.510> finish<00:03:00.959> up<00:03:01.140> building<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.980> walls<00:03:02.190> all

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
and I finish up building the walls all

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.199 
and I finish up building the walls all
the<00:03:02.670> windows<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.180> should<00:03:03.360> say<00:03:03.599> here<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.910> I

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
the windows I should say here and then I

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.990 
the windows I should say here and then I
believe<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.630> go<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.590> try<00:03:07.880> interior

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
believe I go on to try interior

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.809 
believe I go on to try interior
oh<00:03:09.150> no<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.840> doing<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> edge<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.099> want<00:03:11.519> this

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
oh no I'm doing the edge now I want this

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.650 
oh no I'm doing the edge now I want this
to<00:03:12.060> be<00:03:12.209> kind<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.290> rounded<00:03:13.890> off<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> lot<00:03:14.430> less<00:03:15.150> not

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
to be kind of rounded off a lot less not

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.720 
to be kind of rounded off a lot less not
just<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> flat<00:03:16.260> plane<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.860> solve<00:03:17.069> an<00:03:17.220> indent

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
just a flat plane that solve an indent

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.479 
just a flat plane that solve an indent
out<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:19.139> do<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.590> quite<00:03:19.829> nicely<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.370> think

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
out and I do that quite nicely I think

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.030 
out and I do that quite nicely I think
mixing<00:03:21.389> up<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.630> layers<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.109> keeping<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
mixing up the layers and keeping a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.030 
mixing up the layers and keeping a
continuous<00:03:24.030> ring<00:03:24.389> of<00:03:24.569> copper<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.350> tin<00:03:25.799> around

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
continuous ring of copper and tin around

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.280 
continuous ring of copper and tin around
the<00:03:26.340> top<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.760> bottom<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.690> without<00:03:27.959> having<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
the top and bottom so without having to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.590 
the top and bottom so without having to
break<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.799> or<00:03:29.040> use<00:03:29.250> any<00:03:29.370> big<00:03:29.639> flat<00:03:29.970> surfaces

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
break that or use any big flat surfaces

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.110 
break that or use any big flat surfaces
I'm<00:03:30.900> very<00:03:31.410> happy<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.980> effect<00:03:32.340> there<00:03:32.819> ends

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
I'm very happy of the effect there ends

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.830 
I'm very happy of the effect there ends
up<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.069> come<00:03:35.310> around<00:03:35.549> here<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.389> just<00:03:36.569> add

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
up as so I come around here and just add

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.569 
up as so I come around here and just add
a<00:03:36.870> bit<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.109> strengthening<00:03:37.859> steel<00:03:38.250> just

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
a bit of strengthening steel just

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.129 
a bit of strengthening steel just
because<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.850> looked<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.359> little<00:03:39.600> bit<00:03:39.930> out<00:03:40.109> of

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
because it looked a little bit out of

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.410 
because it looked a little bit out of
place<00:03:40.470> having<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.519> big<00:03:41.760> circle<00:03:42.060> just

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
place having this big circle just

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.809 
place having this big circle just
abruptly<00:03:42.959> stopped<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.590> wanted<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.010> give<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.670> a

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
abruptly stopped I wanted to give that a

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.569 
abruptly stopped I wanted to give that a
bit<00:03:45.060> more<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.420> transition<00:03:46.220> coming<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.400> now

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
bit more of a transition coming in now

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.990 
bit more of a transition coming in now
and<00:03:47.609> adding<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.569> light<00:03:48.810> in<00:03:49.700> again<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
and adding in the light in again it's a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
and adding in the light in again it's a
shame<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:51.420> have<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.810> these<00:03:52.049> levers<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
shame we have to have these levers and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.789 
shame we have to have these levers and
wires<00:03:53.370> running<00:03:53.850> around<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:55.049> it's<00:03:55.440> definitely

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
wires running around but it's definitely

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.440 
wires running around but it's definitely
worth<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.579> for<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> outside

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
worth it I think for the outside

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
worth it I think for the outside
aesthetic<00:03:58.139> with<00:03:58.349> all<00:03:58.530> these<00:03:58.709> green<00:03:59.069> lamps

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
aesthetic with all these green lamps

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.849 
aesthetic with all these green lamps
especially<00:04:00.139> considering<00:04:01.139> this<00:04:01.500> being<00:04:01.769> a

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
especially considering this being a

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.280 
especially considering this being a
Space<00:04:02.130> Station<00:04:02.639> any<00:04:02.880> images<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.959> would<00:04:04.170> be

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
Space Station any images of it would be

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.410 
Space Station any images of it would be
taken<00:04:04.769> at<00:04:04.950> nighttime<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.790> give<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.060> effect<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
taken at nighttime to give the effect of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.800 
taken at nighttime to give the effect of
space<00:04:07.400> coming<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.790> laying<00:04:09.030> down<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.599> Tim

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
space coming in and laying down the Tim

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.690 
space coming in and laying down the Tim
blocks<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.470> floor<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:10.950> again<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.459> same

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
blocks the floor and again the same

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.250 
blocks the floor and again the same
house<00:04:12.000> style<00:04:12.329> we'll<00:04:12.540> be<00:04:12.630> using<00:04:12.840> throughout

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
house style we'll be using throughout

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.240 
house style we'll be using throughout
this<00:04:13.590> series<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:15.419> I<00:04:15.540> pull<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:17.070> area

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
this series and I pull out a little area

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.140 
this series and I pull out a little area
up<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.030> reinforced<00:04:18.900> clamp<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.400> looking

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
up to that reinforced clamp and looking

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.760 
up to that reinforced clamp and looking
around<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.750> think<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.140> doesn't<00:04:22.320> look<00:04:22.530> quite

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
around I think it doesn't look quite

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.529 
around I think it doesn't look quite
right<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.400> top<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.789> add<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.150> another

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
right on the top so I add in another

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.990 
right on the top so I add in another
strip<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.990> dark<00:04:25.289> matter

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
strip of dark matter

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.890 
strip of dark matter
and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:26.960> I'm<00:04:27.080> happy<00:04:27.440> with<00:04:27.920> how<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.280> looks<00:04:28.900> so

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
and then I'm happy with how it looks so

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.350 
and then I'm happy with how it looks so
after<00:04:30.230> fixing<00:04:30.530> up<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.950> wires<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:31.730> broke<00:04:31.970> I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
after fixing up the wires I just broke I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.660 
after fixing up the wires I just broke I
think<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.380> time<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.710> come<00:04:34.130> along<00:04:34.370> and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
think that it's time to come along and

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.620 
think that it's time to come along and
play<00:04:34.940> around<00:04:35.090> with<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.080> joining<00:04:36.920> of<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.940> to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
play around with the joining of this to

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.450 
play around with the joining of this to
the<00:04:39.050> main<00:04:39.230> disc<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.800> had<00:04:40.040> some<00:04:40.250> problems

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
the main disc and I had some problems

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.660 
the main disc and I had some problems
with<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.000> as<00:04:41.180> well<00:04:41.740> because<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.770> wanted<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.520> do

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
with this as well because I wanted to do

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.420 
with this as well because I wanted to do
some<00:04:44.000> fancy<00:04:44.330> things<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.080> yet<00:04:45.740> again<00:04:45.890> they<00:04:46.280> did

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
some fancy things and yet again they did

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.060 
some fancy things and yet again they did
not<00:04:46.580> work<00:04:46.790> I'm<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.240> most<00:04:47.510> successful<00:04:48.070> these

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
not work I'm the most successful these

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.640 
not work I'm the most successful these
last<00:04:49.430> couple<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.820> weeks<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:50.570> at<00:04:50.900> least<00:04:50.990> we<00:04:51.500> get

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
last couple of weeks but at least we get

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.140 
last couple of weeks but at least we get
out<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.890> that<00:04:52.040> habit<00:04:52.250> now<00:04:52.520> again<00:04:52.850> something

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
out of that habit now again something

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.420 
out of that habit now again something
good<00:04:53.510> done<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.530> ended<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:54.920> with<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.190> very

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
good done so I ended up with a very

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.090 
good done so I ended up with a very
simple<00:04:55.880> style<00:04:56.420> walkway<00:04:56.960> between<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.920> two

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
simple style walkway between the two

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.420 
simple style walkway between the two
buildings<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:59.530> actually<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:00.740> simple<00:05:01.250> I

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
buildings and actually so simple I

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.040 
buildings and actually so simple I
wasn't<00:05:01.730> quite<00:05:01.850> happy<00:05:02.180> with<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.450> so<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.600> added<00:05:02.810> in

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
wasn't quite happy with it so I added in

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.100 
wasn't quite happy with it so I added in
two<00:05:03.830> copper<00:05:04.310> rings<00:05:04.640> equi<00:05:05.150> distant<00:05:05.180> from<00:05:05.870> their

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
two copper rings equi distant from their

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.350 
two copper rings equi distant from their
respective<00:05:06.680> edges<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:07.940> thought<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.270> was

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
respective edges and I thought that was

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360 
respective edges and I thought that was
a<00:05:08.390> very<00:05:08.570> nice<00:05:08.750> effect<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.290> little<00:05:09.590> tiny<00:05:09.920> detail

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
a very nice effect a little tiny detail

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.120 
a very nice effect a little tiny detail
gave<00:05:10.730> it<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:10.970> bit<00:05:11.210> more<00:05:11.390> character<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.230> that's

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
gave it a bit more character and that's

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.220 
gave it a bit more character and that's
it<00:05:13.370> for<00:05:13.610> today<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:14.090> was<00:05:14.210> very<00:05:14.360> short<00:05:14.720> episode

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
it for today it was very short episode

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.780 
it for today it was very short episode
because<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.530> wanted<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.980> get<00:05:16.160> myself<00:05:16.340> out<00:05:16.730> of

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
because I wanted to get myself out of

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.420 
because I wanted to get myself out of
this<00:05:17.090> building<00:05:17.360> slum<00:05:17.810> by<00:05:17.990> being<00:05:18.260> in<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.770> get

think of the docking station and of the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.710 
think of the docking station and of the
