00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
but nevertheless it's a nice base it's a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.729 
but nevertheless it's a nice base it's a
lot<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.590> rubble<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:36.040> carnage<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:38.560> well

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739

sculpted<00:02:39.310> he<00:02:40.299> has

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.420 

a<00:02:43.120> lot<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.930> texture<00:02:46.650> let's<00:02:47.650> see<00:02:47.890> trying<00:02:48.340> to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
a lot of texture let's see trying to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.640 
a lot of texture let's see trying to
focus<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.880> we<00:02:52.000> go<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.959> lot<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.260> texture

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
focus there we go it's a lot of texture

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.839 
focus there we go it's a lot of texture
so<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.890> almost<00:02:54.010> looks<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.489> suit<00:02:54.700> is

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849
