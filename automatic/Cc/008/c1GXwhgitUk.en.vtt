00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060 

Oh

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.070 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.200 

lighting<00:00:04.070> can<00:00:04.220> be<00:00:04.250> a<00:00:04.340> tough<00:00:04.670> thing<00:00:04.700> to<00:00:04.940> wrap

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
lighting can be a tough thing to wrap

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.210 
lighting can be a tough thing to wrap
your<00:00:05.390> head<00:00:05.569> around<00:00:05.600> and<00:00:06.020> sometimes<00:00:06.680> one<00:00:07.190> of

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
your head around and sometimes one of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.610 
your head around and sometimes one of
the<00:00:07.370> best<00:00:07.670> ways<00:00:07.880> to<00:00:07.910> learn<00:00:08.210> is<00:00:08.780> to<00:00:09.230> see<00:00:09.469> how

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
the best ways to learn is to see how

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.199 
the best ways to learn is to see how
something's<00:00:10.040> done<00:00:10.340> and<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.820> look<00:00:10.969> at<00:00:11.090> the

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209 
something's done and to look at the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.539 
something's done and to look at the
results<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:12.320> for<00:00:12.530> this<00:00:12.619> tutorial<00:00:13.190> we<00:00:13.280> wanted

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
results so for this tutorial we wanted

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.369 
results so for this tutorial we wanted
to<00:00:13.670> light<00:00:14.090> a<00:00:14.119> scene<00:00:14.450> in<00:00:14.719> three<00:00:14.990> different<00:00:15.170> ways

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
to light a scene in three different ways

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.130 
to light a scene in three different ways
using<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:16.280> same<00:00:16.490> set<00:00:16.970> of<00:00:17.180> lights<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:17.660> then

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
using the same set of lights and then

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.070 
using the same set of lights and then
deconstruct<00:00:18.890> both<00:00:19.160> how<00:00:19.550> it<00:00:19.759> was<00:00:19.939> done<00:00:20.179> and<00:00:20.420> why

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
deconstruct both how it was done and why

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.410 
deconstruct both how it was done and why
it<00:00:21.140> was<00:00:21.439> done<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.339> we<00:00:22.460> came<00:00:22.670> up<00:00:22.730> with<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.060> scene

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
it was done so we came up with a scene

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.659 
it was done so we came up with a scene
something<00:00:24.109> very<00:00:24.470> simple<00:00:24.769> somebody<00:00:25.550> gets

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
something very simple somebody gets

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.339 
something very simple somebody gets
called<00:00:26.060> down<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.359> his<00:00:26.449> boss's<00:00:26.839> office<00:00:26.990> and

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
called down to his boss's office and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.230 
called down to his boss's office and
while<00:00:27.830> he's<00:00:27.980> waiting<00:00:28.339> outside<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.730> office

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
while he's waiting outside the office

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.089 
while he's waiting outside the office
he's<00:00:29.539> daydreaming<00:00:29.839> about<00:00:30.349> what<00:00:30.710> might<00:00:30.919> happen

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
he's daydreaming about what might happen

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.760 
he's daydreaming about what might happen
he<00:00:31.820> comes<00:00:32.029> up<00:00:32.150> with<00:00:32.180> three<00:00:32.570> possible

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
he comes up with three possible

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.050 
he comes up with three possible
scenarios<00:00:33.770> in<00:00:33.950> his<00:00:34.040> head<00:00:34.250> he<00:00:34.730> might<00:00:34.760> get

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
scenarios in his head he might get

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.770 
scenarios in his head he might get
promoted

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
promoted

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.690 
promoted
he<00:00:36.050> might<00:00:36.200> get<00:00:36.320> fired<00:00:36.620> or<00:00:36.920> maybe<00:00:37.370> she's<00:00:37.580> trying

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
he might get fired or maybe she's trying

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.850 
he might get fired or maybe she's trying
to<00:00:37.820> pick<00:00:38.030> him<00:00:38.150> up<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.080> take<00:00:39.320> each<00:00:39.560> one<00:00:39.710> of

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
to pick him up so we take each one of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.260 
to pick him up so we take each one of
those<00:00:39.980> scenarios<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.670> then<00:00:40.790> we<00:00:40.880> say<00:00:41.030> how

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
those scenarios and then we say how

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.610 
those scenarios and then we say how
would<00:00:41.330> we<00:00:41.510> want<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.720> lighting<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.200> look<00:00:42.410> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
would we want the lighting to look and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.040 
would we want the lighting to look and
how<00:00:42.980> are<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.340> to<00:00:43.490> achieve<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.960> we

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
how are we going to achieve that so we

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.750 
how are we going to achieve that so we
have<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.320> same<00:00:45.530> five<00:00:45.920> lights<00:00:46.220> for<00:00:46.460> every

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
have the same five lights for every

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.150 
have the same five lights for every
scene<00:00:47.000> we<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.600> three<00:00:47.870> Profoto<00:00:48.470> daylight

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
scene we have three Profoto daylight

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.810 
scene we have three Profoto daylight
airs<00:00:49.430> which<00:00:50.090> are<00:00:50.300> an<00:00:50.390> HMI<00:00:50.930> at<00:00:51.310> 5600<00:00:52.310> Kelvin<00:00:52.340> and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
airs which are an HMI at 5600 Kelvin and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.500 
airs which are an HMI at 5600 Kelvin and
we<00:00:53.480> have<00:00:53.660> two<00:00:54.170> Profoto<00:00:54.890> tungsten<00:00:55.580> airs<00:00:55.790> which

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
we have two Profoto tungsten airs which

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.840 
we have two Profoto tungsten airs which
are<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:56.690> thousand<00:00:57.320> watt<00:00:57.470> halogen<00:00:57.980> light<00:00:58.610> at

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
are a thousand watt halogen light at

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.960 
are a thousand watt halogen light at
about<00:00:59.330> 3200<00:01:00.320> Kelvin<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.340> challenge<00:01:01.790> with

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
about 3200 Kelvin so the challenge with

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.600 
about 3200 Kelvin so the challenge with
each<00:01:02.210> scene<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.990> where<00:01:03.710> we're<00:01:03.950> going<00:01:04.189> to<00:01:04.309> put

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
each scene is where we're going to put

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.550 
each scene is where we're going to put
the<00:01:04.759> lights<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.479> also<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.900> modifiers<00:01:06.439> that

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the lights but also the modifiers that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.830 
the lights but also the modifiers that
we're<00:01:06.770> gonna<00:01:06.890> put<00:01:07.190> on<00:01:07.460> them<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.120> in<00:01:08.480> front<00:01:08.750> of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
we're gonna put on them and in front of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.330 
we're gonna put on them and in front of
them<00:01:09.020> now<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:09.650> have<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> selection<00:01:10.100> of

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
them now we have a selection of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.160 
them now we have a selection of
different<00:01:10.490> modifiers<00:01:11.150> from<00:01:11.420> Profoto<00:01:11.930> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
different modifiers from Profoto and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.780 
different modifiers from Profoto and
that's<00:01:12.380> what's<00:01:12.590> gonna<00:01:12.710> make<00:01:12.800> this<00:01:13.070> really<00:01:13.430> fun

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
that's what's gonna make this really fun

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.210 
that's what's gonna make this really fun
so<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:14.360> can<00:01:14.450> use<00:01:14.600> these<00:01:14.750> same<00:01:14.960> five<00:01:15.230> lights<00:01:15.560> but

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
so we can use these same five lights but

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.370 
so we can use these same five lights but
move<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.580> modifiers<00:01:17.210> around<00:01:17.600> in<00:01:17.810> countless

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
move the modifiers around in countless

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.670 
move the modifiers around in countless
combinations<00:01:18.760> so<00:01:19.760> we<00:01:19.880> have<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> 2x3<00:01:20.480> softbox<00:01:21.260> we

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
combinations so we have a 2x3 softbox we

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.430 
combinations so we have a 2x3 softbox we
have<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.830> 4<00:01:22.250> by<00:01:22.490> 6<00:01:22.520> softbox<00:01:23.510> we<00:01:24.080> have<00:01:24.230> their

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
have a 4 by 6 softbox we have their

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.260 
have a 4 by 6 softbox we have their
magnum<00:01:24.950> reflector<00:01:25.159> which<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.909> great<00:01:26.090> for

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
magnum reflector which is great for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.480 
magnum reflector which is great for
directing<00:01:27.020> light<00:01:27.230> having<00:01:27.770> more<00:01:28.070> defined

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
directing light having more defined

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.490 
directing light having more defined
shadows<00:01:28.940> we<00:01:29.570> have<00:01:29.720> their<00:01:29.900> soft<00:01:30.140> white

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
shadows we have their soft white

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.710 
shadows we have their soft white
reflector<00:01:31.130> often<00:01:31.909> called<00:01:32.120> a<00:01:32.210> beauty<00:01:32.570> dish

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
reflector often called a beauty dish

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.660 
reflector often called a beauty dish
that<00:01:33.260> gives<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> much<00:01:33.740> softer<00:01:34.310> light<00:01:34.490> an

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
that gives you much softer light an

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.540 
that gives you much softer light an
alternative<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> softbox<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.950> great<00:01:37.310> in

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
alternative to a softbox and is great in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.180 
alternative to a softbox and is great in
close<00:01:37.940> with<00:01:38.510> our<00:01:38.659> characters<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.770> also<00:01:39.920> have

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
close with our characters we also have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.310 
close with our characters we also have
the<00:01:40.340> cine<00:01:40.640> reflector<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:41.900> allows<00:01:42.110> us<00:01:42.140> to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the cine reflector now this allows us to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.740 
the cine reflector now this allows us to
put<00:01:42.500> barn<00:01:42.800> doors<00:01:43.100> on<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.430> end<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.180> then<00:01:44.570> use

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
put barn doors on the end and then use

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080 
put barn doors on the end and then use
lenses<00:01:45.260> in<00:01:45.409> between<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.460> lenses<00:01:46.820> gonna

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
lenses in between and the lenses gonna

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.600 
lenses in between and the lenses gonna
allow<00:01:47.299> us<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.659> have<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.840> wider<00:01:48.260> or<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.650> more<00:01:49.190> spot

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
allow us to have a wider or a more spot

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.240 
allow us to have a wider or a more spot
light<00:01:50.000> output<00:01:50.420> what<00:01:51.290> is<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:51.530> cool<00:01:51.770> about<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
light output what is so cool about the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.399 
light output what is so cool about the
daylight<00:01:52.670> air<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.600> tungsten<00:01:53.840> air<00:01:54.229> is

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
daylight air and the tungsten air is

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.500 
daylight air and the tungsten air is
that<00:01:54.740> we<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.010> use<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.280> Profoto<00:01:55.670> air<00:01:55.970> remote

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
that we can use the Profoto air remote

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.570 
that we can use the Profoto air remote
to<00:01:56.780> control<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.650> them<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.040> turn<00:01:58.220> them<00:01:58.370> on

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
to control all of them to turn them on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.000 
to control all of them to turn them on
and<00:01:58.790> off<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.360> also<00:01:59.690> control<00:02:00.320> their<00:02:00.740> light

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
and off and also control their light

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.730 
and off and also control their light
output<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.119> imagine<00:02:02.540> having<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.869> light<00:02:03.080> 15<00:02:03.530> feet

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
output so imagine having a light 15 feet

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.950 
output so imagine having a light 15 feet
in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.890> air<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.369> wanting<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:04.970> change<00:02:05.299> how

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
in the air and wanting to change how

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.249 
in the air and wanting to change how
bright<00:02:06.440> or<00:02:06.619> dim<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.670> if<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.690> want<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.989> sit

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
bright or dim it is or if we want to sit

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.410 
bright or dim it is or if we want to sit
back<00:02:09.440> look<00:02:10.039> through<00:02:10.280> our<00:02:10.310> camera<00:02:10.909> and<00:02:11.090> then

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
back look through our camera and then

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.269 
back look through our camera and then
change<00:02:11.749> the<00:02:11.930> relative<00:02:12.439> intensities<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.159> our

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:13.279 
change the relative intensities of our

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.890 
change the relative intensities of our
different<00:02:13.639> light<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.120> dial<00:02:14.359> in<00:02:14.510> our<00:02:14.689> look

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
different light to dial in our look

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.940 
different light to dial in our look
exactly

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
exactly

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.800 
exactly
so<00:02:16.580> let's<00:02:16.760> first<00:02:17.060> take<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.390> look<00:02:17.569> at<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so let's first take a look at the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.510 
so let's first take a look at the
finished<00:02:18.170> film<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.950> then<00:02:19.069> we're<00:02:19.160> gonna<00:02:19.250> take

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
finished film and then we're gonna take

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.880 
finished film and then we're gonna take
it<00:02:19.640> apart<00:02:19.910> scene<00:02:20.330> by<00:02:20.480> scene<00:02:20.750> talk<00:02:21.380> about<00:02:21.620> how

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
it apart scene by scene talk about how

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.070 
it apart scene by scene talk about how

back<00:03:47.320> here<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:48.130> about<00:03:48.370> 15<00:03:48.730> feet<00:03:48.910> back<00:03:49.120> 12<00:03:50.110> to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
back here it's about 15 feet back 12 to

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.140 
back here it's about 15 feet back 12 to
13<00:03:50.710> feet<00:03:50.920> in<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.160> air<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.520> we're<00:03:51.970> only

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
13 feet in the air and we're only

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.610 
13 feet in the air and we're only
actually<00:03:52.480> having<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:52.870> about<00:03:52.960> 60%

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
actually having it at about 60%

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.500 
actually having it at about 60%
brightness<00:03:54.250> right<00:03:54.310> now<00:03:54.610> because<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.210> all<00:03:55.360> we

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
brightness right now because it's all we

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.420 
brightness right now because it's all we
need<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.750> get<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.320> nice<00:03:56.620> balance<00:03:57.070> between<00:03:57.130> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
need to get a nice balance between the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.400 
need to get a nice balance between the
key<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.420> natural<00:03:58.870> fill<00:03:59.050> we're<00:03:59.200> getting

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
key and the natural fill we're getting

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.810 
key and the natural fill we're getting
from<00:03:59.560> our<00:03:59.620> foam<00:03:59.860> core<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.340> just<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
from our foam core and just the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.760 
from our foam core and just the
reflective<00:04:01.270> ceiling<00:04:01.630> we're<00:04:02.110> also<00:04:02.290> using<00:04:02.590> a

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
reflective ceiling we're also using a

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.340 
reflective ceiling we're also using a
second<00:04:03.130> HMI<00:04:03.490> out<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.060> window<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.990> one<00:04:05.230> we

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
second HMI out the window this one we

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.810 
second HMI out the window this one we
actually<00:04:05.380> have<00:04:05.800> blasting<00:04:06.250> through<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:06.610> trees

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
actually have blasting through the trees

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.340 
actually have blasting through the trees
and<00:04:07.000> through<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.270> window<00:04:07.600> we're<00:04:07.900> gonna<00:04:08.050> mesh

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
and through the window we're gonna mesh

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.380 
and through the window we're gonna mesh
in<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> window<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:08.950> comes<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.120> we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
in the window that comes with it so we

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.150 
in the window that comes with it so we
need<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.570> lot<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.840> power<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.650> through<00:04:12.010> all

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
need a lot of power to get through all

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.800 
need a lot of power to get through all
of<00:04:12.190> those<00:04:12.430> different<00:04:12.790> modifiers<00:04:13.210> and<00:04:13.690> then

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
of those different modifiers and then

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.630 
of those different modifiers and then
come<00:04:13.990> in<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.260> act<00:04:14.470> as<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> hair<00:04:14.890> light<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.310> also

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
come in and act as a hair light it also

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.940 
come in and act as a hair light it also
kind<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.090> gives<00:04:16.299> us<00:04:16.420> some<00:04:16.660> nice<00:04:16.780> detail<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
kind of gives us some nice detail on the

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.070 
kind of gives us some nice detail on the
objects<00:04:18.340> on<00:04:18.489> her<00:04:18.640> desk<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.780> we<00:04:19.900> have<00:04:19.989> our

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
objects on her desk and we have our

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.010 
objects on her desk and we have our
third<00:04:20.320> light<00:04:20.530> which<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.190> our<00:04:21.370> 1k<00:04:22.150> tungsten

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
third light which is our 1k tungsten

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.020 
third light which is our 1k tungsten
light<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.440> we<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:23.980> all<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.700> filters

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
light and we have all the filters

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.850 
light and we have all the filters
removed<00:04:25.360> from<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.140> get<00:04:26.260> as<00:04:26.380> much<00:04:26.620> light

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
removed from that to get as much light

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.980 
removed from that to get as much light
as<00:04:26.890> possible<00:04:27.010> we<00:04:27.640> throw<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.820> CTB<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.480> top<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.870> it

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
as possible we throw a CTB on top of it

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.540 
as possible we throw a CTB on top of it
to<00:04:29.140> gel<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.560> match<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.710> daylight<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.400> our

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
to gel it to match the daylight of our

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.120 
to gel it to match the daylight of our
two<00:04:30.669> HMIS<00:04:31.120> then<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.870> have<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> tree<00:04:32.290> in<00:04:32.320> front<00:04:32.470> we

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
two HMIS then we have a tree in front we

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.800 
two HMIS then we have a tree in front we
shake<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.550> subtly<00:04:33.970> what<00:04:34.180> we<00:04:34.270> call<00:04:34.419> manual

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
shake that subtly what we call manual

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.850 
shake that subtly what we call manual
twinkle<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:35.410> gives<00:04:35.560> us<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.680> nice

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
twinkle and that gives us a nice

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770 
twinkle and that gives us a nice
rustling<00:04:36.430> pattern<00:04:36.850> on<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> back<00:04:37.300> wall<00:04:37.540> so

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
rustling pattern on the back wall so

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.200 
rustling pattern on the back wall so
once<00:04:38.169> we<00:04:38.320> get<00:04:38.530> our<00:04:38.800> talent<00:04:39.460> or<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> stand-in<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
once we get our talent or a stand-in to

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.300 
once we get our talent or a stand-in to
sit<00:04:40.510> here<00:04:40.810> with<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.560> remote<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:42.040> can<00:04:42.190> actually

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
sit here with the remote we can actually

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.280 
sit here with the remote we can actually
change<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.940> balance<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.480> our<00:04:43.600> entire<00:04:43.930> set

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
change the balance of our entire set

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.560 
change the balance of our entire set
from<00:04:44.680> our<00:04:44.830> hair<00:04:45.010> light<00:04:45.220> our<00:04:45.430> key<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.120> our

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
from our hair light our key and our

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.360 
from our hair light our key and our
background<00:04:46.810> light<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.650> we<00:04:47.740> dial<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:48.250> in

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
background light to we dial it in

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.640 
background light to we dial it in
exactly<00:04:48.970> perfect<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.660> wonder<00:04:50.320> why<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.470> got

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.730 
gonna start with our key light and then
we're<00:05:10.270> gonna<00:05:10.360> use<00:05:10.450> an<00:05:10.780> HMI<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:11.500> we're<00:05:11.590> gonna

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
we're gonna use an HMI and we're gonna

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.320 
we're gonna use an HMI and we're gonna
bring<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.010> in<00:05:12.100> close<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.669> we<00:05:12.790> have<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.090> really

bring it in close so we have a really

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.750 
bring it in close so we have a really
high<00:05:13.419> intensity<00:05:14.169> we<00:05:14.650> can<00:05:14.800> really<00:05:15.100> overpower

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
high intensity we can really overpower

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.060 
high intensity we can really overpower
any<00:05:16.090> natural<00:05:16.419> light<00:05:16.840> that's<00:05:17.110> here<00:05:17.500> so<00:05:17.919> that

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
any natural light that's here so that

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.550 
any natural light that's here so that
she<00:05:18.340> becomes<00:05:18.669> singled<00:05:19.120> out<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.260> rest<00:05:20.440> of

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
she becomes singled out and the rest of

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.440 
she becomes singled out and the rest of
the<00:05:20.680> set<00:05:20.860> falls<00:05:21.130> away<00:05:21.310> we're<00:05:22.090> gonna<00:05:22.180> throw

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
the set falls away we're gonna throw

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.590 
the set falls away we're gonna throw
Afrin<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.990> lens<00:05:23.290> in<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.220> HMI<00:05:24.730> to<00:05:25.060> focus<00:05:25.450> the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
Afrin a lens in the HMI to focus the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.850 
Afrin a lens in the HMI to focus the
light<00:05:25.720> in<00:05:25.870> more<00:05:26.110> we're<00:05:26.500> also<00:05:26.590> going<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.800> use

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
light in more we're also going to use

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.190 
light in more we're also going to use
barn<00:05:27.250> doors<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:28.150> help<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.450> from<00:05:28.600> spilling<00:05:28.930> off

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
barn doors to help it from spilling off

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.890 
barn doors to help it from spilling off
the<00:05:29.530> rest<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:29.979> set<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:30.430> through<00:05:31.150> diffusion

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
the rest of the set we through diffusion

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.409 
the rest of the set we through diffusion
right<00:05:32.139> in<00:05:32.320> front<00:05:32.560> here<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.940> well<00:05:34.270> it

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
right in front here so that well it

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.780 
right in front here so that well it
looks<00:05:34.660> evil<00:05:35.229> we<00:05:35.440> get<00:05:35.590> harsh<00:05:35.860> lines<00:05:36.160> it's<00:05:36.550> still

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
looks evil we get harsh lines it's still

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.730 
looks evil we get harsh lines it's still
not<00:05:36.940> super<00:05:37.509> super<00:05:37.840> sharp<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.320> it's<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.650> little

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
not super super sharp and it's a little

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.800 
not super super sharp and it's a little
bit<00:05:38.889> more<00:05:39.190> flattering<00:05:39.580> on<00:05:39.910> our<00:05:40.060> talent<00:05:40.479> for

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
bit more flattering on our talent for

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.620 
bit more flattering on our talent for
our<00:05:41.199> background<00:05:41.919> all<00:05:42.490> we<00:05:42.759> did<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.180> here's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
our background all we did is here's

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.110 
our background all we did is here's
another<00:05:43.870> 1k<00:05:44.470> tungsten<00:05:45.039> light<00:05:45.220> and<00:05:45.789> we<00:05:45.910> turned

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
another 1k tungsten light and we turned

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.510 
another 1k tungsten light and we turned
it<00:05:46.180> on<00:05:46.300> really<00:05:46.600> really<00:05:46.960> dim<00:05:47.169> about<00:05:47.560> 35<00:05:48.220> so<00:05:48.490> a

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
it on really really dim about 35 so a

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.310 
it on really really dim about 35 so a
third<00:05:48.940> of<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.180> power<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.690> that's<00:05:50.169> just

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
third of the power and that's just

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.230 
third of the power and that's just
giving<00:05:50.590> us<00:05:50.680> an<00:05:50.830> eerie<00:05:51.130> glow<00:05:51.220> outside<00:05:52.090> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
giving us an eerie glow outside the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.480 
giving us an eerie glow outside the
window<00:05:52.600> so<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.199> there's<00:05:53.410> some<00:05:53.800> life<00:05:54.070> there

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
window so that there's some life there

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.659 
window so that there's some life there
but<00:05:55.330> again<00:05:55.449> it's<00:05:56.320> very<00:05:56.440> warm<00:05:56.919> we've<00:05:57.490> actually

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
but again it's very warm we've actually

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.330 
but again it's very warm we've actually
taken<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.270> CTO<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:59.380> we<00:05:59.500> put<00:05:59.770> that<00:05:59.800> on<00:06:00.039> top<00:06:00.280> of

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
taken a CTO and we put that on top of

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.460 
taken a CTO and we put that on top of
the<00:06:00.580> tungsten<00:06:00.789> so<00:06:01.210> it's<00:06:01.360> super<00:06:01.900> orange

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
the tungsten so it's super orange

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.469 
the tungsten so it's super orange
outside<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.009> window<00:06:03.280> again<00:06:03.669> making<00:06:04.360> the

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
outside the window again making the

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.980 
outside the window again making the
background<00:06:04.720> around<00:06:05.139> her<00:06:05.650> feel<00:06:06.130> really<00:06:06.400> warm

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
background around her feel really warm

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.779 
background around her feel really warm
to<00:06:07.990> play<00:06:08.169> off<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.470> evil<00:06:08.650> where<00:06:09.160> she's<00:06:09.550> lit

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
to play off the evil where she's lit

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.020 
to play off the evil where she's lit
completely<00:06:10.270> daylight<00:06:10.949> 5600<00:06:11.979> from<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.610> HMI

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
completely daylight 5600 from this HMI

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.150 
completely daylight 5600 from this HMI
yeah<00:06:13.900> I<00:06:14.199> wish<00:06:15.780> well<00:06:16.780> what<00:06:17.410> if<00:06:17.500> this<00:06:17.620> isn't<00:06:17.860> good

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
yeah I wish well what if this isn't good

yeah I wish well what if this isn't good
news<00:06:18.720> but<00:06:19.720> what<00:06:19.900> if<00:06:19.990> they<00:06:20.110> are<00:06:20.139> downsizing<00:06:20.680> and

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
news but what if they are downsizing and

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.939 
news but what if they are downsizing and
I'm<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.100> first<00:06:21.280> to<00:06:21.370> go<00:06:21.550> what<00:06:22.389> exactly<00:06:23.289> do<00:06:23.919> you

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
I'm the first to go what exactly do you

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.820 
I'm the first to go what exactly do you
do<00:06:24.490> here<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:25.360> here's<00:06:25.570> our<00:06:25.690> third<00:06:25.960> setup<00:06:26.440> in

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
do here so here's our third setup in

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.680 
do here so here's our third setup in
this<00:06:27.160> one<00:06:27.430> he's<00:06:27.699> thinking<00:06:28.030> that<00:06:28.180> maybe<00:06:28.419> she's

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
this one he's thinking that maybe she's

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.570 
this one he's thinking that maybe she's
trying<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:29.020> come<00:06:29.169> on<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.380> him<00:06:29.620> so<00:06:29.830> for<00:06:30.280> this<00:06:30.370> we

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
trying to come on to him so for this we

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.310 
trying to come on to him so for this we
want<00:06:30.729> a<00:06:30.759> really<00:06:30.970> glamorous<00:06:31.539> look<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.229> our

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
want a really glamorous look to our

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.930 
want a really glamorous look to our
lighting<00:06:32.650> so<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:33.220> first<00:06:33.520> thing<00:06:33.699> we're<00:06:33.849> gonna

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
lighting so the first thing we're gonna

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.820 
lighting so the first thing we're gonna
think<00:06:34.180> about<00:06:34.270> is<00:06:34.599> our<00:06:34.720> key<00:06:34.960> light<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:35.349> for

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
think about is our key light and for

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.439 
think about is our key light and for
that<00:06:35.919> we're<00:06:36.070> gonna<00:06:36.130> go<00:06:36.370> to<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.639> four<00:06:36.940> by<00:06:37.090> six

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
that we're gonna go to the four by six

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:38.790 
that we're gonna go to the four by six

when<00:06:39.160> we<00:06:39.250> put<00:06:39.400> that<00:06:39.520> on<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.729> HMI<00:06:40.210> we've<00:06:40.720> got<00:06:40.870> a

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
when we put that on the HMI we've got a

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.490 
when we put that on the HMI we've got a
super<00:06:41.710> bright<00:06:41.979> super<00:06:42.280> soft<00:06:43.270> key<00:06:43.900> light<00:06:44.110> we're

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
super bright super soft key light we're

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.439 
super bright super soft key light we're
gonna<00:06:44.620> walk<00:06:44.889> that<00:06:45.070> in<00:06:45.220> super<00:06:45.520> super<00:06:45.820> close<00:06:46.180> and

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
gonna walk that in super super close and

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.230 
gonna walk that in super super close and
put<00:06:47.110> it<00:06:47.199> vertical<00:06:47.710> along<00:06:48.190> her<00:06:48.430> side<00:06:48.699> so<00:06:49.150> we're

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
put it vertical along her side so we're

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.210 
put it vertical along her side so we're
gonna<00:06:49.330> get<00:06:49.419> a<00:06:49.479> really<00:06:49.960> nice<00:06:50.289> soft<00:06:50.590> light<00:06:50.919> on<00:06:50.949> it

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
gonna get a really nice soft light on it

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.550 
gonna get a really nice soft light on it
then<00:06:51.820> we're<00:06:51.970> gonna<00:06:52.060> add<00:06:52.270> a<00:06:52.300> 4x4<00:06:52.930> reflector<00:06:53.409> to

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
then we're gonna add a 4x4 reflector to

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.620 
then we're gonna add a 4x4 reflector to
the<00:06:53.650> other<00:06:53.800> side<00:06:54.099> we're<00:06:54.669> gonna<00:06:54.729> have<00:06:54.940> a<00:06:55.000> really

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
the other side we're gonna have a really

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.719 
the other side we're gonna have a really
nice<00:06:55.840> ratio<00:06:56.169> between<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.830> two<00:06:57.010> for<00:06:57.639> the

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
nice ratio between the two for the

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.159 
nice ratio between the two for the
background<00:06:58.210> we're<00:06:58.389> gonna<00:06:58.510> use<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.900> soft

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
background we're gonna use the soft

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.860 
background we're gonna use the soft
reflector<00:06:59.949> on<00:07:00.070> another<00:07:00.370> HMI<00:07:00.880> and<00:07:01.150> just<00:07:01.659> turn

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
reflector on another HMI and just turn

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.870 
reflector on another HMI and just turn
that<00:07:01.900> all<00:07:02.260> the<00:07:02.440> way<00:07:02.560> up<00:07:02.770> to<00:07:03.280> give<00:07:03.460> it<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.639> really

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
that all the way up to give it a really

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.000 
that all the way up to give it a really
nice<00:07:04.150> hair<00:07:04.570> light<00:07:04.780> we're<00:07:05.440> gonna<00:07:05.530> use<00:07:05.740> one<00:07:05.919> of

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
nice hair light we're gonna use one of

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.550 
nice hair light we're gonna use one of
the<00:07:06.070> tungsten<00:07:06.490> lights<00:07:06.699> with<00:07:07.300> a<00:07:07.330> CTB<00:07:08.050> gel<00:07:08.349> on

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
the tungsten lights with a CTB gel on

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.320 
the tungsten lights with a CTB gel on
the<00:07:08.770> background<00:07:09.370> to<00:07:09.580> kind<00:07:09.760> of<00:07:09.820> spot<00:07:10.120> the

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
the background to kind of spot the

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.260 
the background to kind of spot the
center<00:07:10.690> and<00:07:10.870> draw<00:07:11.440> the<00:07:11.500> focus<00:07:11.800> in<00:07:12.190> on<00:07:12.460> her<00:07:12.880> our

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
center and draw the focus in on her our

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.659 
center and draw the focus in on her our
last<00:07:13.599> light<00:07:13.900> is<00:07:14.050> an<00:07:14.440> HMI<00:07:14.889> outside<00:07:15.250> the<00:07:15.370> window

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
last light is an HMI outside the window

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.879 
last light is an HMI outside the window
that's<00:07:15.970> our<00:07:16.150> third<00:07:16.539> HMI<00:07:17.020> for<00:07:17.229> this<00:07:17.349> setup<00:07:17.650> one

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
that's our third HMI for this setup one

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:19.710 
that's our third HMI for this setup one
is<00:07:17.979> the<00:07:18.130> key<00:07:18.340> one<00:07:18.940> is<00:07:18.970> our<00:07:19.150> hair<00:07:19.300> light<00:07:19.510> and

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
is the key one is our hair light and

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.149 
is the key one is our hair light and
then<00:07:19.840> one<00:07:20.110> coming<00:07:20.440> through<00:07:20.470> the<00:07:20.680> window<00:07:20.979> and

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159 
then one coming through the window and

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:22.920 
then one coming through the window and
that's<00:07:21.490> really<00:07:21.909> just<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.210> light<00:07:22.389> up<00:07:22.539> the<00:07:22.659> trees

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
that's really just to light up the trees

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.930 
that's really just to light up the trees
and<00:07:23.199> give<00:07:23.770> the<00:07:23.919> outside<00:07:24.310> a<00:07:24.340> little<00:07:24.580> bit<00:07:24.699> more

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
and give the outside a little bit more

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.040 
and give the outside a little bit more
depth<00:07:25.349> probably<00:07:26.349> not

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
depth probably not

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.589 
depth probably not

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.670 
able to shoot these scenes in the set to

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.250 
able to shoot these scenes in the set to
have<00:07:46.790> three<00:07:47.120> different<00:07:47.150> personalities<00:07:47.870> and

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.260 
have three different personalities and

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.230 
have three different personalities and
need<00:07:48.620> to<00:07:48.740> create<00:07:49.070> it<00:07:49.220> with<00:07:49.340> just<00:07:49.580> five<00:07:49.910> lights

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 
need to create it with just five lights

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.810 
need to create it with just five lights
and<00:07:50.450> the<00:07:50.780> same<00:07:50.990> set<00:07:51.230> of<00:07:51.350> modifiers<00:07:51.770> what<00:07:52.460> is<00:07:52.580> so

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:52.820 
and the same set of modifiers what is so

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.970 
and the same set of modifiers what is so
cool<00:07:53.090> for<00:07:53.330> us<00:07:53.420> is<00:07:53.690> that<00:07:53.930> we<00:07:54.080> first<00:07:54.440> got<00:07:54.800> these

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:54.980 
cool for us is that we first got these

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.700 
cool for us is that we first got these
pro<00:07:55.220> photo<00:07:55.460> lights<00:07:55.760> they<00:07:56.240> were<00:07:56.300> so<00:07:56.750> easy<00:07:57.200> from

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:57.710 
pro photo lights they were so easy from

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.110 
pro photo lights they were so easy from
the<00:07:57.830> moment<00:07:58.130> we<00:07:58.190> took<00:07:58.310> them<00:07:58.460> out<00:07:58.550> of<00:07:58.640> the<00:07:58.730> box

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 
the moment we took them out of the box

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.880 
the moment we took them out of the box
everything<00:07:59.630> is<00:07:59.720> so<00:07:59.900> clearly<00:08:00.290> labeled<00:08:00.740> and

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:00.890 
everything is so clearly labeled and

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.740 
everything is so clearly labeled and
it's<00:08:01.190> very<00:08:01.580> easy<00:08:01.670> to<00:08:02.090> pick<00:08:02.360> it<00:08:02.480> up<00:08:02.570> and

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750 
it's very easy to pick it up and

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.140 
it's very easy to pick it up and
understand<00:08:03.170> exactly<00:08:03.350> what<00:08:04.250> each<00:08:04.460> modifier

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.150 
understand exactly what each modifier

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.340 
understand exactly what each modifier
and<00:08:05.420> each<00:08:05.870> light<00:08:06.260> is<00:08:06.500> able<00:08:06.890> to<00:08:07.070> do
