00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.470
 good as we can say for 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.509
 develop myself with our skills 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.669
 increase awareness of the right side 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.769
 left to strengthen the 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:13.009
 logic and reflection skills 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 our partner Alejandro is going to do 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.869
 a little demonstration of how we can 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.240
 strengthen our right hemisphere 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.090
 using the left hand this 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.019
 they could keep opening faucets doing 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.300
 puzzle 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.990
 writing with herself or also 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.060
 using or grabbing these objects by 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.559
 that hand with which we are always 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.559
 accustomed on the right 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.280
 Well first I'll show you how 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.490
 I write with the right hand of the number 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.500
 of 10-9 to see the difference the 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.850
 ease 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 nice for favors 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.430
 good as you see I do not take so much work 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.740
 not now let's see how much I 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:10.630
 effort with the left forgiveness was made 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.630
 at all some insulted with words 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 good as you see to begin with I took more 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.020
 they even give me a coma it cost me work 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.070
 between one and another friend if you see the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.530
 difference if in itself ugly festive not 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.420
 I know what I would do if I asked for my right hand and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.340
 well also this now is at the end 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.210
 partner leave what you write your name 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.210
 with the left hand 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.180
 the difference a little ugly but I 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.050
 I think of studying medicine 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.900
 doubt of qualification 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.900
 at the time pasta with grandmother left 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.380
 good as you see is hard penalties 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 crutch violence 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.480
 It's all a piece of furniture to understand and do
