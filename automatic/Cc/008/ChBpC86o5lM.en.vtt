00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
people have been using drones for

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430 
people have been using drones for
decades<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:05.970> just<00:00:06.150> haven't<00:00:06.450> realized<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.990> we

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
decades we just haven't realized that we

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.709 
decades we just haven't realized that we
called<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.770> model<00:00:08.099> aircraft<00:00:08.269> what's<00:00:09.269> new<00:00:09.510> is

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
called the model aircraft what's new is

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.450 
called the model aircraft what's new is
the<00:00:09.750> popularity<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:11.070> these<00:00:11.160> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the popularity of using these for

the popularity of using these for
commercial<00:00:11.790> purposes<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.389> technology

commercial purposes and the technology

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
commercial purposes and the technology
has<00:00:13.049> gotten<00:00:13.139> even<00:00:13.380> better<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.950> demand<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.429> now

at really sort of a breaking point I've
been<00:00:23.910> building<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> flying<00:00:24.750> drones<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.830> 20

years<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.609> personally<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.269> probably

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
years and I personally have probably

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.410 
years and I personally have probably
like<00:00:27.869> 25<00:00:28.199> or<00:00:28.320> more<00:00:28.800> model<00:00:29.580> aircraft<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.330> are

agency originally everyone was thinking

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
agency originally everyone was thinking
about<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.600> military<00:01:04.080> drones<00:01:04.470> they're<00:01:04.830> large

they fly at high altitudes they fly in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
they fly at high altitudes they fly in
the<00:01:07.500> same<00:01:07.680> airspace<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.400> manned<00:01:08.670> aircraft

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the same airspace as manned aircraft

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
the same airspace as manned aircraft
that<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.049> require<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that was going to require a lot of

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
that was going to require a lot of
regulation<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.909> bring<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> domestic

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
regulation to bring to the domestic

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
regulation to bring to the domestic
market<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.890> we've<00:01:14.070> had<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> past

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
market but what we've had in the past

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
market but what we've had in the past
few<00:01:14.820> years<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> real<00:01:15.540> transformation<00:01:16.080> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
few years is a real transformation in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
few years is a real transformation in
the<00:01:16.590> technology<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.549> talking

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the technology so now we're talking

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
the technology so now we're talking
about<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> small<00:01:18.390> multi<00:01:19.320> rotor<00:01:19.530> aircraft

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
about the small multi rotor aircraft

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.010 
about the small multi rotor aircraft
with<00:01:20.460> cameras<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.270> board<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.750> quad

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with cameras on board so you have quad

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
with cameras on board so you have quad
copters<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.799> things<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.130> weigh<00:01:23.310> only

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
copters you have things that weigh only

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
copters you have things that weigh only
a<00:01:23.580> few<00:01:23.790> pounds<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> great

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
a few pounds they can do a lot of great

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
a few pounds they can do a lot of great
work<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> don't<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.040> requires<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
work and I don't think that requires the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
work and I don't think that requires the
same<00:01:26.790> level<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> regulation<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.650> are

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
same level of regulation there are

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
same level of regulation there are
countless<00:01:28.979> companies<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.659> me

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
countless companies that have come to me

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
countless companies that have come to me
and<00:01:31.020> said<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.619> want<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.189> path<00:01:32.520> forward<00:01:32.850> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and said look we want a path forward we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
and said look we want a path forward we
want<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.810> understand<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> framework<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
want to understand what the framework is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
want to understand what the framework is
and<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:36.540> industry<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and what can we do as an industry to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.270 
and what can we do as an industry to
move<00:01:37.350> forward<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.860> there's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> lot<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
move forward I think there's a lot of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
move forward I think there's a lot of
frustration<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.960> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
frustration and I just want to see that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.190 
frustration and I just want to see that
the<00:01:40.530> technology<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.400> used<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.049> its

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the technology really used to to its

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
the technology really used to to its
greatest<00:01:43.530> benefit<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:45.450> almost<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
greatest benefit it's almost a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
greatest benefit it's almost a

no-brainer every time a hiker is missing
you<00:01:48.149> should<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.020> launch<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you should go out there and launch a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
you should go out there and launch a

fields<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.460> could<00:02:18.640> tell<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.180> your

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
fields if you could tell that your

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.660 
fields if you could tell that your
infestation<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.160> corner<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.550> the

infestation is just in one corner of the
field<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.300> just<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> spot<00:02:23.320> application

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
field and just do a spot application

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.440 
field and just do a spot application
that's<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.580> cost<00:02:24.820> savings<00:02:25.270> that's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that's a cost savings that's

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.680 
that's a cost savings that's
environmentally<00:02:26.170> beneficial<00:02:27.180> everyone<00:02:28.180> wins

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.540 

so<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.350> think<00:02:32.709> revolutionary

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
so it's really I think revolutionary

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.190 
so it's really I think revolutionary
technology<00:02:34.180> we're<00:02:34.330> only<00:02:34.450> beginning<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.900> see

the<00:02:36.130> potential<00:02:36.459> sort<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.209> early

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the potential sort of like the early

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.480 
the potential sort of like the early
days<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> internet<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.350> understood<00:02:38.800> you

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
days of the internet we understood you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.910 
days of the internet we understood you
could<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:40.380> transactions<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.530> could<00:02:41.680> send

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
could do transactions you could send

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.320 
could do transactions you could send
emails<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.520> could<00:02:42.670> communicate<00:02:42.820> with<00:02:43.120> people

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330

emails you could communicate with people
but<00:02:43.959> now<00:02:44.230> we've<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.800> internet<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.910> our

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
but now we've got this internet in our

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.570 
but now we've got this internet in our
pockets<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.989> we're<00:02:47.200> using<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.860> different

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
pockets and we're using it in different

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 
pockets and we're using it in different
ways<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.120> never<00:02:49.270> expected<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.380> same

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
ways we never expected so it's the same

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.750 
ways we never expected so it's the same
