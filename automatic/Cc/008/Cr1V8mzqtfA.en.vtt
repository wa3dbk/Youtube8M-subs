 a rustic terrace or an urban terrace 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 but in addition to aesthetics it is important 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.870
 that we check the level of compliance 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.130
 which is capable of offering 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.970
 remember that the terrace is a space 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.330
 destined to relax to rest and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.580
 practically to free us from stress 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.610

 comfortable as possible inside the house and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.550
 last but not least the

 be resistant to rain and sun is a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.420
 of the most chosen but currently 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.540
 we have many other alternatives more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.910
