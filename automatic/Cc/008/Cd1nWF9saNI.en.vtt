00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello everyone, I hope you know 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.690
 find very well first of all not 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.880
 I'm going to put the intro since it makes the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 sony vegas I walk badly I have the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.130
 lucky to have the best computer 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.289
 in quotes xd but good in this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.390
 video I'll talk about a theory this theory 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.279
 I let her use a friend and subscriber 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 called andrÃ©s burgos chinchilla what 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.099
 will relate just as he wrote it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.170
 Vacuate stay located on route 22 in 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.019
 we do not find absolutely anything 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.360
 just two objects magnetite terror table 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 and interestingly, both are for a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 ghost type pokemon now in this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 cave we have already seen practically a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 Equal design in the cave thalasia birds 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.579
 legendary and in the dungeon rarely and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 again a coincidence they contain 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 Legendary - in the vacant room where 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 I've run into a series of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 coincidences in all there is a legendary 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.030
 - in abaqua stay in the ranch 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.260
 empty there are only two objects of type 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 ghost and I think today for later 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 I remembered the hotel ghost girl 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 ritz and pull and while I was looking for more 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.579
 data 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.340
 with a photo filmed by a hacker 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.310
 unknown that contained in the stay 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.159
 empty to the ghost girl and this is the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 conclusion of my theory the event of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 opas will be in the abaqua ranch where 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 so that it appears to us we will have to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
 have seen the ghost girl in the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.209
 elevator and in the hotel ritz and pull 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.979
 where in the vacated room she will be 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.229
 there and we stand in front of her and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.990
 We press to speak she says I think you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.359
 I've seen before it will be true 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.459
 after this a noise will sound 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.640
 pokemon the one that I believe and I hope it's either 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.829
 for later the lights in the stay 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 vacua will title as happened in the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.179
 elevator she will disappear they will return to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.189
 flicker the lights after she does not 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.649
 is it appears or stops at the front of the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.379
 coach releases his usual sound and 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.780
 the battle starts good this is your 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:59.219
 theory x he let me use it because 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.200
 I'm short on ideas 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.969
 I want you to give me something to do x 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.549
 I do not know is that I do not have many ideas 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.780
 lately good i say goodbye here people 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.110
