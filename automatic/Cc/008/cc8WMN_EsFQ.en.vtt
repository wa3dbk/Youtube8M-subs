putting the open face toward the ball
like<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.260> they're<00:01:04.559> wasting<00:01:05.040> an<00:01:05.250> awful<00:01:05.549> lot

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
like this they're wasting an awful lot

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
like this they're wasting an awful lot
of<00:01:06.450> power<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
of power so if there was a way that we

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
of power so if there was a way that we
could<00:01:09.330> spring<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> racket<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:11.180> streamlined

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
could spring the racket more streamlined

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
could spring the racket more streamlined
at<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> ball<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.869> open<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> last

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
at the ball and open up at the last

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
at the ball and open up at the last
minute<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.590> they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
minute that's what we want to do they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
minute that's what we want to do they
used<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> teach<00:01:17.189> people<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> serve<00:01:18.570> by

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
used to teach people how to serve by

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440 
used to teach people how to serve by
going<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.619> onto<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.130> grassy<00:01:20.670> football<00:01:21.119> field

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
going out onto a grassy football field

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.260 
going out onto a grassy football field
and<00:01:21.659> taking<00:01:21.869> several<00:01:22.650> old<00:01:23.070> racquets<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.909> see

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and taking several old racquets and see

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
and taking several old racquets and see
how<00:01:24.689> far<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.500> throw<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.070> racket

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
how far you could throw that racket

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.890 
how far you could throw that racket
making<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.570> end<00:01:27.920> over<00:01:28.920> end<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.600> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
making it go end over end just like so

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.319 
making it go end over end just like so
because<00:01:31.710> obviously<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> most

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because obviously that's the most

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
because obviously that's the most
streamlined<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> racket

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
streamlined way to put on a racket

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
streamlined way to put on a racket
through<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> air<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.689> end<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.560> end<00:01:37.590> like

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
through the air is end over end like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.469 
through the air is end over end like
this<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> teaching<00:01:42.240> somebody

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
this so what we do and teaching somebody

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.410 
this so what we do and teaching somebody
how<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> serve<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.610> throw<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
how to serve is we have them throw the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.920 
how to serve is we have them throw the
racket<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.670> manner<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
racket like that in that manner as if it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.800 
racket like that in that manner as if it
were<00:01:49.049> maybe<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.619> axe<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.360> trying<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
were maybe an axe and you were trying to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
stick an axe into a piece of wood if you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.990 
stick an axe into a piece of wood if you
were<00:01:55.500> trying<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> stick<00:01:56.070> an<00:01:56.189> axe<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> piece

were trying to stick an axe into a piece
of<00:01:57.030> wood<00:01:57.180> you'd<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> blade<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.130> the<00:02:00.090> axe

of wood you'd want the blade and the axe

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
of wood you'd want the blade and the axe
to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.659> traveling<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> hit

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
to be traveling like this so when it hit

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.780 
to be traveling like this so when it hit
the<00:02:02.430> wood<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.930> would<00:02:04.049> stick<00:02:04.380> wouldn't<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.520> very

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the wood it would stick wouldn't do very

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
the wood it would stick wouldn't do very
good<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.450> threw<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> axe<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.860> like

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
good if you threw the axe at it like

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
good if you threw the axe at it like
this<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.300> around<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.810> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
this and it was going around like that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.700 
this and it was going around like that
and<00:02:10.050> hit<00:02:10.379> like

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
and hit like

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.710 
and hit like
so<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> talk<00:02:12.510> about

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so so what we're going to talk about

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.250 
so so what we're going to talk about
today<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.490> ability<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.570> able<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> throw

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
today is the ability to be able to throw

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.250 
today is the ability to be able to throw
that<00:02:16.620> racket<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:18.090> ball<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.470> manner

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
that racket at the ball in this manner

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.290 
that racket at the ball in this manner
so<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.980> looks<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.820> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.060> hit<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
so it looks like it's going to hit the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.670 
so it looks like it's going to hit the
ball<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.750> edge<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.320> we're<00:02:25.500> going<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
ball on the edge and then we're going to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
ball on the edge and then we're going to
turn<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.610> end<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.210> we've<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
turn it at the end and we've got a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.110 
turn it at the end and we've got a
special<00:02:27.780> device<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:29.250> show<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> do

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
special device to show you how to do

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.870 
special device to show you how to do
that<00:02:30.270> now<00:02:31.140> here's<00:02:31.500> our<00:02:31.710> special<00:02:31.980> device<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
that now here's our special device and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.900 
that now here's our special device and
we're<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> call<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.620> flop<00:02:35.550> stick

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
we're going to call this a flop stick

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.400 
we're going to call this a flop stick
because<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:37.770> flops<00:02:38.520> over<00:02:38.990> however<00:02:39.990> if<00:02:40.230> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
because it flops over however if you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860 
because it flops over however if you
make<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> right<00:02:41.040> service<00:02:41.760> motion<00:02:42.210> when<00:02:42.720> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
make the right service motion when you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.650 
make the right service motion when you
do<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.320> serve<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:44.520> won't<00:02:44.850> flop<00:02:45.120> over

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
do that serve it won't flop over

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.200 
do that serve it won't flop over
and<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.110> teaches<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.650> how<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.100> basically<00:02:47.370> pull

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and it teaches you how to basically pull

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.900 
and it teaches you how to basically pull
your<00:02:48.390> elbow<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.930> put<00:02:49.500> your<00:02:49.650> elbow<00:02:49.920> out<00:02:49.950> bend

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
your elbow in put your elbow out bend

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.150 
your elbow in put your elbow out bend
your<00:02:51.090> wrist<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:52.290> manner<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
your wrist in just the right manner so

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.620 
your wrist in just the right manner so
that<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.550> make<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.880> perfect<00:02:54.300> service

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that you can make that perfect service

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.610 
that you can make that perfect service
motion<00:02:55.020> now<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:56.490> do<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:57.290> when<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.440> come

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
motion now what do we do when we come

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.490 
motion now what do we do when we come
back<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.760> old<00:02:59.910> backscratcher<00:03:00.510> motion<00:03:01.230> you've

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
back the old backscratcher motion you've

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.680 
back the old backscratcher motion you've
heard<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.890> maybe<00:03:02.130> come<00:03:02.880> back<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.480> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
heard that maybe come back like this and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.260 
heard that maybe come back like this and
lay<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> racket<00:03:04.320> back<00:03:04.730> okay<00:03:05.730> here's<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
lay the racket back okay here's the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.500 
lay the racket back okay here's the
trick<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.720> keep<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.080> from<00:03:07.260> opening<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.830> face

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
trick to keep you from opening that face

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.530 
trick to keep you from opening that face
take<00:03:09.510> your<00:03:09.690> elbow<00:03:10.200> right<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:11.460> like<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
take your elbow right here like so and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.870 
take your elbow right here like so and
point<00:03:13.380> your<00:03:13.560> elbow<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> little<00:03:14.190> bit<00:03:14.610> more

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
point your elbow a little bit more

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.560 
point your elbow a little bit more
toward<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> net<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.020> what<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:16.920> does<00:03:17.570> that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
toward the net and what that does that

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.170 
toward the net and what that does that
takes<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.560> brings<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.160> racket<00:03:20.670> back<00:03:20.880> on

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
takes and it brings this racket back on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.500 
takes and it brings this racket back on
its<00:03:21.630> integrity<00:03:22.440> face<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
its integrity face and this is the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.660 
its integrity face and this is the
integrity<00:03:24.840> face<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.560> got<00:03:25.740> integrity<00:03:26.160> like

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
integrity face it's got integrity like

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.890 
integrity face it's got integrity like
this<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.720> doesn't<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.350> integrity<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.220> that

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
this it doesn't have integrity like that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.290 
this it doesn't have integrity like that
so<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.650> were<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.920> swing<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.580> this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
so if you were to swing it in this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.230 
so if you were to swing it in this
manner<00:03:34.010> you'd<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.220> able<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.550> swing<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.030> very

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
manner you'd be able to swing it very

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.230 
manner you'd be able to swing it very
well<00:03:36.770> because<00:03:37.770> that's<00:03:37.950> where<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.670> integrity

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
well because that's where the integrity

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.850 
well because that's where the integrity
is<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:43.740> trick<00:03:43.980> about<00:03:44.280> laying<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.240> back

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
is now the trick about laying it back

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.220 
is now the trick about laying it back
all<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.400> tilt<00:03:48.300> your<00:03:48.510> elbow<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:48.930> bit

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
all you do tilt your elbow a little bit

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.620 
all you do tilt your elbow a little bit
toward<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> net<00:03:49.830> bring<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> racket<00:03:50.910> back<00:03:51.240> now

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
toward the net bring the racket back now

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.920 
toward the net bring the racket back now
you<00:03:51.690> can<00:03:52.110> see<00:03:52.500> when<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.490> line<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.060> that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you can see when you line it up that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.260 
you can see when you line it up that
it's<00:03:55.110> laying<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.620> its<00:03:55.920> integrity<00:03:56.370> face<00:03:56.880> and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
it's laying on its integrity face and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.530 
it's laying on its integrity face and
now<00:03:57.900> all<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.770> is<00:03:59.300> throw<00:04:00.300> it

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
now all you have to do is throw it

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.580 
now all you have to do is throw it
toward<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.990> ball<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:04.230> open

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
toward the ball like this and you open

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.830
