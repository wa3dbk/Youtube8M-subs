of trees in there that you can buy now

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
of trees in there that you can buy now
the<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.630> Hass<00:00:27.900> avocado<00:00:28.560> tree<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the first one the Hass avocado tree is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
the first one the Hass avocado tree is
probably<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.359> recommend

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
probably the one that I would recommend

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.100 
probably the one that I would recommend
the<00:00:31.470> most<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.309> having<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.759> yard<00:00:33.210> just

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the most for having in your yard just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799 
the most for having in your yard just
for<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> fact<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.120> it's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.390> tricky<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
for the fact that it's a bit tricky to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
for the fact that it's a bit tricky to
know<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.469> pick<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> fruits<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
know when you go and pick the fruits and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
know when you go and pick the fruits and
they<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.180> start<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.629> black<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
they just as I start to go black you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
they just as I start to go black you
know<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> oil<00:00:41.010> content<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.940> getting<00:00:42.210> up

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
know that the oil content is getting up

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
know that the oil content is getting up
there<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> fruit<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.410> weren't

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
there and the fruit because they weren't

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
there and the fruit because they weren't
tasting<00:00:44.100> legal<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> oil<00:00:44.879> content<00:00:45.420> team

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
tasting legal into the oil content team

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
tasting legal into the oil content team
and<00:00:45.870> also<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> nutritions<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and also in the nutritions not in the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.029 
and also in the nutritions not in the
fruit<00:00:48.270> until<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> oil<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.649> through<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
fruit until the oil is or through the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.580 
fruit until the oil is or through the
fruit<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.379> starting

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
fruit also so you can see them starting

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950 
fruit also so you can see them starting
to<00:00:52.770> change<00:00:53.010> color<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.510> where<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> go

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to change color and you know where to go

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
to change color and you know where to go
and<00:00:55.140> pick<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.090> another

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and pick them the for what a is another

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
and pick them the for what a is another
type<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> avocado<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.120> grow<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
type of avocado and they grow into a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.930 
type of avocado and they grow into a
really<00:01:01.050> big<00:01:01.260> tree<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> lot

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really big tree and they do need a lot

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.980 
really big tree and they do need a lot
of<00:01:03.090> pruning<00:01:03.769> but<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:05.159> produce<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.990> beautiful

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of pruning but they produce a beautiful

Stewart avocado tree and some cold
avocado<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.619> what

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
avocado here which I don't know what

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
avocado here which I don't know what
variety<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.850> looks<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
variety that is it looks like it's a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.770 
variety that is it looks like it's a
type<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.040> house<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.240> possibly

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
type of house there which they possibly

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
type of house there which they possibly
grows<00:01:37.079> from<00:01:37.259> coal<00:01:37.500> buns<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> New<00:01:38.040> Zealand<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
grows from coal buns in New Zealand so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.690 
grows from coal buns in New Zealand so
it<00:01:38.700> could<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.180> similar<00:01:39.689> variety<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
it could be this similar variety to that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.240 
it could be this similar variety to that
so<00:01:41.700> yeah<00:01:42.090> Amazon's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.930> great<00:01:43.320> place<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so yeah Amazon's a great place to go and

that<00:02:04.650> these<00:02:04.830> trees<00:02:05.190> will<00:02:05.460> come<00:02:05.490> grafted<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that these trees will come grafted and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.050 
that these trees will come grafted and
will<00:02:06.960> produce<00:02:07.170> fruit<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> first<00:02:08.369> year<00:02:08.729> but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
will produce fruit in the first year but

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
will produce fruit in the first year but
I<00:02:09.090> recommend<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.690> pick<00:02:09.959> off<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> fruit

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
I recommend that you pick off the fruit

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.199 
I recommend that you pick off the fruit
in<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> first<00:02:10.979> year<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> let<00:02:11.850> them<00:02:12.030> grow

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
in the first year and let them grow

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.090 
in the first year and let them grow
through<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:12.989> produce<00:02:13.200> much<00:02:13.800> more

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
through so they produce much more

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.280 
through so they produce much more
quality<00:02:14.850> fruit<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> years<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.989> come

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
quality fruit in the years to come

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350 
quality fruit in the years to come
because<00:02:16.830> these<00:02:17.280> trees<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:18.239> they've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
because these trees think when they've

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
because these trees think when they've
got<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> graft<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:20.100> that's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
got a graft on it they think that that's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 
got a graft on it they think that that's
the<00:02:20.520> maturity<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.390> top<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.989> still<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the maturity on top and that is still a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.670 
the maturity on top and that is still a
mature<00:02:22.560> tree<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.250> gonna<00:02:23.340> spit<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.150> fruit

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
mature tree so it's gonna spit out fruit

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.960 
mature tree so it's gonna spit out fruit
but<00:02:25.680> anyway<00:02:26.010> that's<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.370> whole<00:02:26.519> new<00:02:26.670> story

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
but anyway that's a whole new story
