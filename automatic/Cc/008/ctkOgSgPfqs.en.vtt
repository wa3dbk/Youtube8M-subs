00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.219
 hey people what gives us a warm welcome 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 welcome to the next we to the ski 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 I want to transform today 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 just talk to you about the ones 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 everyone can get 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.660
 the early he goes on the couch in so 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.180
 on the 360 ​​or on the playstation 3 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 has played and his social club 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 account with the next gen as on the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.500
 pc on the xbox from or to the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 Playstation 4 takes as I heard 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 that was supposed to give that weapon was 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 I actually directly convinced 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 that this will be pretty overboard 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 My thought behind it, I can tell you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 I will explain later 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 me a little bit with the topic 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 busy like a weapon 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.539
 how strong she works in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.489
 Real and there are also some think 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.350
 I'm pretty interesting facts 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 this year could prove that the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980
 weapon in any case very very strong 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.250
 I will also be about it later 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.410
 in the course of the videos even start talking 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 we start with that something 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.439
 obvious namely why with me 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.320
 thought directly that this weapon 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.240
 being overboard will be boxer 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 just want to make a lot of money 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.619
 Let's make a quick comparison with FIFA 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 imagine it would be fifa 15 first 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.700
 only on the chambers cengiz and later 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 would be the first player for the nextgen 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 give it and if it fifa we do that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.159
 player previously on the camera 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.869
 have played and later on the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.850
 next change any player 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.710
 simply get the correct correct 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 shit players from the second league 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.579
 nobody would probably buy that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 but would you have a lionel messi or 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.810
 cristiano ronaldo gets paid if 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.610
 you have previously recorded on the couch 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 and then the next one changes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.119
 the probability is already greater 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 the players a real incentive 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.670
 get the game again on the next 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.259
 to buy gene and so does the group 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 So behind that would be the case 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.409
 now in the case of the rule simply 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.670
 Rockstar times a lot of money with this 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 thoughts I have supported myself in 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 internet just a little bit over 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 Regens to German rifles them 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.590
 informed such weapons are known 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.560
 for example, from the future shooters like 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.509
 halo you see it in the picture you have 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 two seemed to be the name 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.540
 The weapon once up once down the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.640
 whole now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.019
 red marked but what exactly do these 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.340
 seemed that I can think with one 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.629
 other graphics a bit 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.340
 explain more clearly 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.709
 In this picture you can see the front 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.599
 part of the rega left and right have the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.849
 We had two rails in the middle 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.370
 projectile and anchor just start it 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.959
 that both seemed electromagnetically 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 loaded are one of the two 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.310
 positive and the other is negative 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
 charged to reach this charge 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.970
 you need a source of energy this 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.650
 Weapon uses in contrast to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.739
 many guns do not have gunpowder 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.109
 but a huge amount of electricity 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.329
 between the rails is the 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.879
 Anchor included projected and accurate 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.889
 behind there, the occurring tries 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.939
 Magnetic field in enclosed cross section 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.159
 to enlarge 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.560
 but this is only in the direction of projectile 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.389
 possible because the rails are firmly parallel 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.159
 connected to each other 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.780
 So the field can not become the 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.760
 but it has to stop 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.829
 as I said in the direction projectile make 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.389
 So the stronger the magnetic field 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.790
 is the faster and stronger 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.669
 also the shot with the weapon am 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.739
 the projectile end celebrates this 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.349
 Impact can be enormous 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.269
 his armor is often one 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.530
 estuary of around two kilometers 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.079
 per second 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.079
 bonn in the us with ray already quite 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.169
 Speeds of more than 35 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.989
 kilometer per second reached that is 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.500
 let's say it's 17 times that of one 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.510
 tank 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.599
 this bowl can also have one 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.169
 distance of up to 150 kilometers 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.870
 to reach 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.970
 that's the distance from hamburg to after 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.530
 Brunswick just open the whole thing 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.169
 the card marks you with this one 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.569
 distance just keep in mind 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.459
 This one can be quite different from the one I am watching 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.530
 However, speech is usually huge 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.840
 protected on ships 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.939
 or are attached to country can 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.409
 no devices you just like that 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.400
 Can hold in hand with the man 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.290
 can run around 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.329
 but considering that exactly 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.819
 technology in gta 5 coming soon 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.699
 smaller and more manageable weapons pressed 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.500
 It will definitely be 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:15.269
 scary what do you think is 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.919
 Rockstar was extremely strong 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.199
 so that many of the game again 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.150
 buy the next gene or while you 're there 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.789
 with others wait quite cool balance there 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.779
 I'm curious to your opinion 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.540
 In addition , I would be interested in how 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.980
 you these 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.560
 video no glitches 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.590
 he is so interested in something in the direction 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.730
 physics but rather overall 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.290
 Information video re is yes 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.880
 five you write the comments or 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.220
 let me through it with a thumb 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.220
 above do not know what people and 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.940
 the
