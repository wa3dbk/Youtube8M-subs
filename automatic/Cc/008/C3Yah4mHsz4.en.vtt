 Swiss that participated in the first 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.019
 female marathon of the world despite going 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.360
 in position number 37 this woman had 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.460
 the willpower to finish the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.100

 watching this video we would not be able to 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.620
 do as this woman did the truth 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.839
 it was also important because it was 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.019
 the first time that women 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.089
 they encouraged good they could legally 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.810
 participate in an Olympic competition 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.690
 of marathon so as you can see the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.940
 importance was quite high 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.950
 temperature was also around 30 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.560
 degrees we are in the city of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 angels and good when he enters the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.899
 the doctors wanted to take care of it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.479
 it was so bad or was it wobbled towards 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.610
 the sides and it was so bad that they thought 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.679
 that he would die that he would give something not a 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 attack or something doctors 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.810
 they were as close as possible in case 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.509
 Maybe something happened to her, she said no 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 that he did not want help and went ahead to 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.790
 Although his body no longer had 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.210
 forces of nothing else 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.960
