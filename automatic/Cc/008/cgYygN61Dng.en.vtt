00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.140
 with von schlissigen frankfurt and me 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.090
 present today by phocuswright enisa 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.840
 ears digital 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.960
 that was just good for this film 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.910
 is actually the option the preamp 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 Use with GM to leverage prempro 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.640
 instruments pro or the ibox one sees 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.770
 here just the surface what 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.770
 well done is i have mine here 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.050
 game controller three grid the against 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.609
 each from 0 to 30 decibels high and 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.010
 I can also normal here whole 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.269
 blow so that it quasi you want from 30 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.579
 until 60 goes decibel 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.589
 I have my dream regulator where 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.469
 I again blow decibel from 0 to 20 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.719
 that means a total of 80 db then 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.989
 of course very typical of trient 48 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.760
 volt phantom power 180 degrees phases 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.409
 Rotation concert takes place closer or 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.159
 just somehow has live problems 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.219
 for correction 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.079
 Hyperspace and quite nice feature 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.549
 even on the internet I show you 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.129
 still on the back 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.260
 because only continue here we see here 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.040
 the input options i can choose 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.750
 between with small and instrument and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.160
 which is quite a good feature at 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.680
 This project is now based on 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.540
 the original 110 is a tramp 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.690
 i can use my input impedance 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 change from low to a quasi denisa 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 dignity with evil 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.760
 it has a huge advantage i have 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.740
 much more sounded properties 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.420
 that is to say, most ordinary prims 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
 I can get out a lot of sound colors 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.290
 whole transformer based prix 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.550
 that means easier with proper 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.530
 import just went somehow 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.240
 corresponding sound color was am 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.480
 Most desired for external frames 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.760
 is to go further here we still see us 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.590
 instrument section I can too 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.810
 the own impedance between cure low 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.330
 change and have my money rule up to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.010
 40 tons which is also quite nice feature 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 this is my input and i have it again 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.890
 an output for my amp that is me 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.979
 You can also easily through 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.860
 grind which go on but the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.890
 I rent you the option here too 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.960
 Photocall to do with it 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.450
 I have the possibility of a back 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.450
 tenants and my parents to trim 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.340
 that is if 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.349
 the head all because I take this 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.709
 Function claim when it is off then 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.780
 At the beginning he sees the same level here 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.349
 you look at the post insert that's me 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.209
 can also be my led chain meter before or 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.290
 after the advertisement take that means if 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.730
 I, for example, compressor still in it 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
 I just like to see myself 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.720
 quasi main level then behaves here 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.250
 of course the LED chain you see the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.890
 two inputs that we of course once 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.040
 either small and then here that is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.269
 almost the eggs are instrumental input 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.459
 which of course in the version 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.680
 really interesting is the thing is called 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.140
 too right digital converter card in it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.540
 I can scan it up to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 192 kilohertz and I have the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.260
 possibility with either an external 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.060
 clock here too here lures 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.980
 if that almost worked out then 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.569
 or finally, as a master too 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.430
 operate an interesting feature 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.690
 phones output that has to do with me 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 can on the one hand directly my 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.230
 Listen to input signals 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.370
 I also have a button that I can 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.440
 Do not even show on the back 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.989
 now on the next page 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.959
 I also see the possibility here 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.950
 the contestants left and the signal 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.109
 to grind through 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.420
 that means I can do the whole thing 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.859
 as a direct mailing use one of the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.630
 commented defense jens theo signal 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.389
 drauflegen and directly over the triumph 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.130
 Listen if you are here whole 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.530
 Surface sees it with whole outputs 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.579
 I go with the analogue one with it 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.850
 an analog part in that digital at 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.639
 that would lend a microphone input xlr 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.340
 can be either via pawl or xlr 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.630
 of course both symmetrical and here 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.639
 up again island of broadcasting the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.109
 return both metric completely 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.510
 interesting feature is I still have 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.849
 times this external input that is mono 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.440
 input also symmetrical gives me the 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.440
 possibility i can if i do the whole thing 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.910
 as a flagship project farm animals signal here 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.079
 then left and right and that 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.470
 also digitize whole if I have 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.519
 would like to 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.299
 So it really is not just one 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.329
 monochrome what a signal goes on then 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.209
 Here too my outputs look on 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.280
 main output once the output shows 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.019
 me too, I can almost the box and the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.510
 run parallel 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.430
 that means it is alone or, so to speak 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.389
 with preamps and instruments 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.419
 preamp 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.919
 which can possibly operate simultaneously 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.669
 Here you see the professionals at once 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.919
 adjust 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.099
 on the one hand from the landlord and second 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.129
 set of the led chain and then to good 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:37.139
 The last ones up here are the quasi 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.060
 hiking map already screwed in there 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.610
 is very clear here with these models 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.009
 my outlook the bnc i have here 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.240
 You can also take it off to see 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.169
 my postings plug can be but 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.289
 that concerns 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.969
 and last but not least optional 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.479
 there are still these new connectors 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.039
 for the cocktail spd plug or it 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.129
 Of course, that's the same thing 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.830
 choose and of course quite regular 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.590
 the on and off switch so the white in the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.020
 So much for this 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.580
 I think there is more to it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.319
 not to say i think he sounds very much 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.789
 well the price-performance ratio on 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.990
 any case, they are super interesting 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.659
 recommend comes over first 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.370
 tried out could also buy can 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:20.159
 nothing goes wrong 33 days money back 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.050
 and 66 days exchange right through worry 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.050
 That's what it was from me in ten days
