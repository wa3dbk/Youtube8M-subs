00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 editing in Asia is not too conceptual 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.259

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.259
 a high-end rock star 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 why recollets super handsome 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.640
 super nice not really dirty part of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.640
 queens is or and shit I missed something 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.300
 hyper of privacy like a bar that's 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.300
 ready so I chose myself 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.780
 in general what is going on around a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.560
 such a very interesting and very good 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:29.450
 agreement in principle of what is happening 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.640
 we fought right now to whom the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.970
 small crowd that releases falls is 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.319
 not unique and not because in 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.180
 some cities I continue daughter of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.940
 my idea since there was the idea 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.090
 sure he shares the bouquet and then 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.489
 that's why it's after having 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.299
 listened one understands that in his memory 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.049
 it's probably that you lose too much 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.900
 but it's wrong as she woos 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:58.920
 because he's not here anymore 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.000
 it's also listening to group and person 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.950
 do not know yet beat for the bouquet 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.580

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 ready to buy the street but I knew 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.550
 not that he was making nonsense jokes 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.650
 we bought the album was not a 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.390
 joke between the songs I know that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.940

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.319

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.970
 we sleep already acquired before a song 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.110
 extremely sad that talks about the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.110
 solitude of very large grids 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.110
