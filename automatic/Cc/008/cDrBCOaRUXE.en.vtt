00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.470
 brush below cut because now it 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.210

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.230
 that you have blurred and all that is 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.260
 impossible but if you take it up 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.420
 the pass and by the flange you eliminate the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.479
 custard edge 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.979

 Bridal makeup giving a little dot 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.610
 a little more tendency to roll with the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.700
 glitters on the upper lashes 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.310

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 nothing but what is sought is a 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.590
 naturalness and how much skin has awakened 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.870
 freshness and what we have strengthened well 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.490
 a little the look with volume of is 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.160

 soft and warm and the lips with a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.040
 natural fresh tone like gloss effect a 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.040
 little bit 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.900
 the alarms 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.500
 the average 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.670
 Y 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.030
 hairstyle 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.410
 the hairstyle trend that marks this 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.510
 spring are the shadows but more 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.590
 heavy these waves are 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.440
 unstructured much more volume the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 areas of the fronts is very high 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.990
 then the head is going to do a little 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.690
 smaller 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.490
 volume on the sides a lot much when 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.760
 the sides to give that power a bit 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.410
 of much more quality not aggressiveness but 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.270
 the hair is much stronger 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.400
 languid floors and that was wavy 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.400
 they marked a romantic part of the west 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.430
 a tip to combine collected with 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.400

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.530
 perfect alright a tip to combine 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.540
 a picked up with a look would be that 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.600
 they will always use in the front area of 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.120
 top plus top plus top plus 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.520
 curly and the rest of the hair or what 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.160
 we leave wavy or we pick it up well 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.110
 pepper and in small that always has 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.120
 what we make the difference of both 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.310
 the cuts as a collected a part 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.930
 small and the other with a lot of volume there 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.730

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.029
 to make us whole so that 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.439
 really be in good condition a 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.949
