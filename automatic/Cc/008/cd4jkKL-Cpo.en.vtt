00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.870

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.480

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.250
 material your goal your seams your 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.339
 zipper in a wide way that was 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.769
 quite powerful and we have bloggers for 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.630
 close it even externally apart from 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 the zipper carries some verses for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.180
 can close zugaza are pretty 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.180
 powerful 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.229
 let's open it to see its 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.229
 inside 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.110
 It has padding in all its extension 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.780
 as well as if it was a book 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.910
 this part will also cover 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.340
 some metro if we want to take it and this 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.690
 obviously it is used to be able 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.869
 put the rods to put it on 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 I do not know how with another one or the skewers with 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.350
 the gray hair 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.109
 the cover on which the open from above 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.920
 if we want to put rods that are more 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.869
 long 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.619
 then we do not have time to close to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 the average of close to half measures 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.400
 out there 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.970
 has opened and can use a sleeve 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.159
 a cane quite well it has some 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.110
 braces that would be these from here for 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.490
 power as you see 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.490
 in closing the one above 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.580
 it looks pretty good 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 his heel was 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.150
 a veal of a little more material 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.500
 with strong salvo rather say 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 case that he gives his life 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.300
 together with an ideal cover for reeds 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.060
 telescopic truly 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.830
 We do not have a cover, they are always covers 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.510
 they are usually much bigger because 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.330
 we have a sleeve of a pretty size 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.240
 good for telescopic loads even 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.180
 bigger and we said that that can 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.040
 excel the material without any type 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.610
 of problem of being a pretty sleeve 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.080
 suitable for all types of cards, so here 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.080
 you have the cover we saw 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.090
