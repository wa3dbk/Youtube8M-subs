00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
wide when you're at the edges so he just

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.860

tipper<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.530> can<00:04:24.710> kill<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.980> super<00:04:25.520> early<00:04:25.640> on

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
tipper you can kill you super early on

this level compared to a lot of others
fair<00:04:29.180> enough<00:04:29.480> so<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.820> got<00:04:31.820> nothing<00:04:32.060> against<00:04:32.330> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370

Fox does get to up smash through
platforms<00:04:35.650> though<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.370> that's<00:04:36.580> kind<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.820> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
platforms though so that's kind of a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.820 
platforms though so that's kind of a
trade-off<00:04:38.040> how<00:04:39.040> was<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.610> not<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.479> spike<00:04:40.840> he

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
trade-off how was that not a spike he

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.040 
trade-off how was that not a spike he
hit<00:04:42.370> him<00:04:42.460> with<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.639> back<00:04:42.790> end<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.270> really<00:04:43.900> look

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
hit him with the back end I really look

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.010 
hit him with the back end I really look
legitimate<00:04:44.380> he<00:04:45.220> didn't<00:04:45.490> know<00:04:45.840> she<00:04:46.840> did<00:04:46.870> he

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
legitimate he didn't know she did he

you can react in time because sometimes

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.939 
you can react in time because sometimes
