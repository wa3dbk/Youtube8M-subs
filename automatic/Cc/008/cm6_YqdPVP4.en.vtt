our<00:00:36.480> competitive<00:00:36.989> set<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.350> there's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.499> couple

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
our competitive set and there's a couple

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.650 
our competitive set and there's a couple
of<00:00:37.769> reasons<00:00:37.890> why<00:00:38.190> we're<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.429> we<00:00:39.390> really

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
of reasons why we're there we really

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.680

outperform in in in city fuel economy

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
outperform in in in city fuel economy
and<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.980> our<00:00:44.070> vehicle<00:00:44.370> runs<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.999> regular

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and also our vehicle runs on on regular

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.239 
and also our vehicle runs on on regular
fuel<00:00:45.690> rather<00:00:45.929> than<00:00:46.079> premium<00:00:46.440> gas<00:00:46.649> unlike<00:00:47.070> many

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
fuel rather than premium gas unlike many

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:48.559 
fuel rather than premium gas unlike many
of<00:00:47.370> our<00:00:47.460> competitors<00:00:47.519> so<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.539> very

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
of our competitors so we're very

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.200 
of our competitors so we're very
competitive<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.739> terms<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.249> fuel

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
competitive in terms of that fuel

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
competitive in terms of that fuel
economy<00:00:51.359> creates<00:00:51.809> challenges<00:00:52.019> for<00:00:52.260> everybody

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
economy creates challenges for everybody

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
economy creates challenges for everybody
of<00:00:52.859> course<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:54.300> we're<00:00:54.899> certainly<00:00:55.140> aware<00:00:55.229> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of course but we're certainly aware of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
of course but we're certainly aware of
that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.249> I've<00:00:56.819> taken<00:00:56.999> into<00:00:57.239> account<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that and I've taken into account for a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.029 
that and I've taken into account for a
lot<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.749> our<00:00:57.899> future<00:00:58.199> product<00:00:58.499> plans<00:00:58.679> as<00:00:58.890> well

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
lot of our future product plans as well

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.509 
lot of our future product plans as well
right

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
right

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.059 
right
I<00:00:59.550> think<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.569> things<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.069> maybe

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
I think one of the things that maybe

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.130 
I think one of the things that maybe
people<00:01:02.339> think<00:01:02.609> about<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.659> comes<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.050> your

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
people think about when it comes to your

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
people think about when it comes to your
products<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.620> they<00:01:04.769> look<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.220> substantial

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
products is they look so substantial

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.209 
products is they look so substantial
maybe<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.810> larger<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
maybe they look larger than they are I

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.569 
maybe they look larger than they are I
mean<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.759> h3<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.659> example<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.829> giant

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
mean an h3 for example is not a giant

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:12.709 
mean an h3 for example is not a giant
giant<00:01:11.700> vehicle<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.329> it's<00:01:12.509> pretty

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
giant vehicle and it's pretty

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.080 
giant vehicle and it's pretty
fuel-efficient<00:01:13.549> vehicle<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> yeah<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
fuel-efficient vehicle it it yeah I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
fuel-efficient vehicle it it yeah I
think<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.079> design

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
think it and I think it's the design

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
think it and I think it's the design
that<00:01:17.070> creates<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.850> impression<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that creates that impression because

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.819 
that creates that impression because
actually<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> h3<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.789> as<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.850> midsize<00:01:21.270> SUV<00:01:21.829> has

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
actually the h3 is as a midsize SUV has

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.560 
actually the h3 is as a midsize SUV has
the<00:01:22.979> same<00:01:23.159> turning<00:01:23.549> turning<00:01:24.210> radiuses<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the same turning turning radiuses a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
the same turning turning radiuses a
Toyota<00:01:24.930> Camry<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.439> example<00:01:25.829> so<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.039> very

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
Toyota Camry for example so it's very

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.090 
Toyota Camry for example so it's very
nimble<00:01:26.490> easy<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> handle<00:01:27.329> for<00:01:27.390> anyone<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
nimble easy to handle for anyone and and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
nimble easy to handle for anyone and and
yep<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> also<00:01:29.909> provides<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.659> very

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
yep and and also provides a very

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.840 
yep and and also provides a very
competitive<00:01:31.110> fuel<00:01:31.439> economy<00:01:31.640> let's<00:01:32.640> talk

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
competitive fuel economy let's talk

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.709 
competitive fuel economy let's talk
about<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.270> brand

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
a day to day basis than purchased yeah

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.759 
a day to day basis than purchased yeah
we<00:02:22.360> s<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.630> estimate<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.049> we<00:02:23.230> estimate<00:02:23.709> that

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
we s we estimate that we estimate that

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.250 
we s we estimate that we estimate that
actually<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> primary<00:02:24.549> driver<00:02:24.880> probably<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.900> is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
actually a primary driver probably is is

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.190 
actually a primary driver probably is is
in<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> range<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.920> 60%<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.959> know<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.080> think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
in the range of 60% so you know I think

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.839 
in the range of 60% so you know I think
that's<00:02:29.380> very<00:02:29.530> telling<00:02:29.799> in<00:02:30.069> terms<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.519> how<00:02:30.640> easy

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
that's very telling in terms of how easy

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.089 
that's very telling in terms of how easy

vehicle a lot of us see Hummers in urban
environments<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:35.019> don't<00:03:35.440> necessarily

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
environments and we don't necessarily

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.379 
environments and we don't necessarily
put<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> two<00:03:36.489> together<00:03:36.609> but<00:03:36.970> this<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.120> an

well<00:04:09.080> let's<00:04:09.680> talk<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.890> bit<00:04:10.010> more<00:04:10.370> about<00:04:10.820> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
well let's talk a bit more about the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.780 
well let's talk a bit more about the
future<00:04:11.390> certainly<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:13.130> might<00:04:13.370> see<00:04:13.580> much

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
future certainly we we might see much

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.760 
future certainly we we might see much
less<00:04:14.000> expensive<00:04:14.600> gasoline<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.320> future<00:04:15.620> we

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
less expensive gasoline in the future we

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.590 
less expensive gasoline in the future we
might<00:04:15.920> see<00:04:16.130> gas<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.970> know<00:04:17.090> go<00:04:17.209> up<00:04:17.239> into<00:04:17.480> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
might see gas you know go up into the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.270 
might see gas you know go up into the
five<00:04:17.750> dollar<00:04:17.989> range<00:04:18.320> sure<00:04:18.560> how<00:04:18.860> do<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.040> deal

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
five dollar range sure how do you deal

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.560 
five dollar range sure how do you deal
with<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.489> kind<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.910> uncertainty<00:04:20.030> and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
with that kind of uncertainty and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.300 
with that kind of uncertainty and
especially<00:04:21.320> as<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.680> relates<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:22.010> your

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
especially as it relates to your

especially as it relates to your
particular<00:04:22.640> brand<00:04:22.940> yeah<00:04:23.360> we've<00:04:24.050> built<00:04:24.290> into

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
particular brand yeah we've built into

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.550 
particular brand yeah we've built into

our future product plans all the
contingencies<00:04:27.920> for<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.640> for<00:04:29.180> example<00:04:29.630> we

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
contingencies for that for example we

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.150 
contingencies for that for example we
made<00:04:30.170> a<00:04:30.200> commitment<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.620> year<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.860> half<00:04:30.980> ago

made a commitment a year and a half ago
that<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.520> would<00:04:31.610> be<00:04:31.760> completely<00:04:32.210> biofuel<00:04:33.020> by

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
that we would be completely biofuel by

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.610 
that we would be completely biofuel by
2010<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:35.420> we<00:04:35.600> will<00:04:35.750> deliver<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:36.440> in

following a couple years late later
we'll<00:04:50.540> do<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.750> same<00:04:50.900> thing<00:04:50.960> with<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.470> h3<00:04:51.940> I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
we'll do the same thing with the h3 I

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.210 
we'll do the same thing with the h3 I
think<00:04:53.570> more<00:04:53.690> importantly<00:04:54.140> though<00:04:54.410> all<00:04:54.980> of<00:04:55.010> our

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
think more importantly though all of our

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.000 
think more importantly though all of our
future<00:04:55.520> plans<00:04:55.820> for<00:04:56.210> vehicles<00:04:57.050> will<00:04:57.740> see<00:04:57.890> us

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
future plans for vehicles will see us

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.070 
future plans for vehicles will see us
building<00:04:58.430> smaller<00:04:59.180> vehicles<00:04:59.690> more

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
building smaller vehicles more

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.720 
building smaller vehicles more
fuel-efficient<00:05:00.680> vehicles<00:05:01.070> without<00:05:01.370> giving

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
fuel-efficient vehicles without giving

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.760 
fuel-efficient vehicles without giving
up<00:05:01.880> any<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.540> off-road<00:05:02.930> capabilities<00:05:03.590> that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
up any of the off-road capabilities that
