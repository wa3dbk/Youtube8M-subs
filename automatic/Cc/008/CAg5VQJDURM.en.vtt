00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.460
 Since May 2013, I have received chemotherapy for six months and ended in November 2013. 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.399
 When initially diagnosed, 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.059
 It feels the most painful. 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.870
 Because my parents died of cancer, 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.149
 It was a tough time for me when I was very young. 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.020
 I have two children and I have to survive for them. 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.809
 We were filming with Profoto B2 at Eastern State Prison today. 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.590
 I am very excited because this light allows me to work faster when shooting a wedding. 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.710
 It's faster than any of the lights I've used. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.490
 I keep shooting in TTL mode, let my lighting assistant hold it and lift it up. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 We took a photo of the wonderful bride and groom. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 Today, we will use this light to shoot our models. 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.069
 Looking back at me... very good. 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.469
 Yeah, arrogant! 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.500
 The temperature in the Eastern State Prison is zero. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 We're using TTL, the modeling light and the fact We use TTL mode, modeling lights, 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.390
 There is no need to use a C-type light stand during shooting. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.500
 Put your hands in front as before. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.469
 Profoto B2 is clearly a changer in the rules of the game, allowing me to work faster 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.259
 It's faster than any off-camera flash system I've used. 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.300
 It feels like getting rid of it, 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.799
 I'm done. I'm free. I did it. I am free. 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.239
 I won't lie down and feel sorry for myself. 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.739
 Or have a feeling like this. 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.150
 I believe that photos have the ability to heal. 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.289
 I have witnessed the changes that have taken pictures of cancer survivors for their worldview. 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.820
 Even if there is a catheter in her body, it is a reminder and a scar. 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.320
 Cherish has been out of cancer for a year and I think it is worth celebrating. 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.410
 In some ways, this has had a positive impact. 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.329
 Let me cherish life even more. 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.430
 I can play with my children and enjoy life. 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 And... I feel more powerful.
