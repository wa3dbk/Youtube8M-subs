00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the starting line completely different

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
the starting line completely different
that<00:01:06.360> pass<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.680> both<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.280> the

that pass and in both a little the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
that pass and in both a little the
little<00:01:08.640> tiny<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.240> hops<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.780> were<00:01:09.869> doing

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
little tiny little hops you were doing

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.859 
little tiny little hops you were doing
and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:11.009> also<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.360> mean<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.810> least

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and then also the I mean at least

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
and then also the I mean at least
different<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.470> noticed<00:01:13.860> previously<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
different that I noticed previously and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320 
different that I noticed previously and
then<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> bike<00:01:16.680> left<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.369> guess<00:01:18.149> your

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then the way the bike left I guess your

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
then the way the bike left I guess your
launch<00:01:18.570> rpm<00:01:19.110> seemed<00:01:19.440> way<00:01:19.649> different<00:01:20.039> than<00:01:20.130> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
launch rpm seemed way different than it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.060 
launch rpm seemed way different than it
had<00:01:20.430> been<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.649> right

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
my observations corrector yeah we've

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.029 
my observations corrector yeah we've
been<00:01:24.780> working<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> two-step<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> little

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.830 
been working on the two-step a little
bit<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.399> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
bit on the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
bit on the
the<00:01:28.350> haltech<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.240> has<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> peak<00:01:30.780> range<00:01:31.049> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the haltech is it has a peak range on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
the haltech is it has a peak range on
the<00:01:31.320> two-step<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:32.610> trying<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> narrow<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the two-step we're trying to narrow it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
the two-step we're trying to narrow it
down<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.750> played<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.380> some<00:01:34.500> stuff<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> I
