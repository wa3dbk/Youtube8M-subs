00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.389
 staff speaks'm Rodrigo and today I would say 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.690
 boxing we're going to take the sony out of the box 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.549
 xperia is 3 from a smartphone that is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 position more or less in the segment of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 it has settings as if 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.330
 expects for this segment a processor 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.029
 quadcore that is not top of the line 1 gb of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.630
 front camera that only legea 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.630
 although back up movie in full hd 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.300
 screen ips that the resolution also lower 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.790
 to which we are accustomed in 854 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 480 and finally let's take a look here 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.030
 underneath the box keeps the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.340
 xperia is 3 of the one that has this part 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.980
 colored background in those specifications 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.399
 basics is telling you that the camera 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.770
 5 megapixels screen has 4.5 inches 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 same size as the first engine g1 of the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 new engine is the quad-core processor 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.470
 audio settings of those companies and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 This is a box that was sent by 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 press office of the long sony already 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.890
 was opened and removing the sticker 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.420
 sees that it was totally fixed all over 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 so we remove it from the packaging to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 to see all your content with everything is 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.960
 the box is quite simple has two 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.920
 compartments here the cell phone here all 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.689
 the rest 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 The content in question is on a usb cable 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 to turn on the computer 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 the power adapter to connect the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.899
 power tools 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.409
 we do not have and a headset that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 seems simple is not intra-atrial has 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.549
 that format of the first headphones that the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:04.079
 apple used on ipods and this is a 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.750
 device itself to remove it from the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.470
 sachet 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.940
 and here I am also seeing who those 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.100
 specifications I've been talking about looks 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.160
 nfc is an interesting thing then 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.800
 2.300 milan skin phone 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.630
 battery that is not there these things but 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.459
 the screen size for the resolution that is 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.650
 We also expect him to give 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:30.020
 reasonable autonomy 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.900
 removing the screen from the screen exists at a 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.820
 adhesive also here indicating dual chip 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.160
 You can take a lot of people out. 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.590
 they even think it's painting the phone 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.550
 will not hit the screen around the finish 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 half rounded the xperia three as 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.130
 happens with several other cell phones 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.510
 sony next door we have the button 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.830
 as well as with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.160
 many of the sony and volume knobs 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.489
 the input to the USB cable is in the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.390
 left at the top of the phone 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.680
 of ear 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.080
 Although it does not seem like you can pull this 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.459
 which is a good 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.239
 samsung my plastic and you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.840
 find the two pilots for the cards 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.500
 yes the chips and also the entrance praxe 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.000
 micro sd battery cards is not easy 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.220
 although you can open the bottom 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.370
 You can not take it at all. 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.630
 put us back and we'll call the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.920
 xperia is 3 do while taking a look at their 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.920
 screens start 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.599
 Okay, we have a well-designed boot 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.599
 with these waves that also 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:03.769
 even appeared in video games on ps3 for 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:14.940
 example came up with a certain load 56% 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:17.579
 is in the Portuguese language brazil 1 to 1 and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.329
 without much ado we have already entered the screen 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.460
 initial chi has this lot of 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.070
 sony, they really do not want me 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.350
 like this, although I already have 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.810
 heard some people using 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.729
 this example may be where pm 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.550
 also added in other androids if 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.800
 You want this one for some photos. 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.550
 shortcuts to the camera and the other 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.639
 applications they are very stylish icons of 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.699
 sony also the rps screen and for what I am 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.190
 seeing here she has a pretty vision 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.710
 reasonable is that screen you 're looking at 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.010
 from the front already it gives a distorted one is good 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.330
 colors in does not have a bacaninha angle and 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.610
 I've been getting used to it lately 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.300
 bigger screens already I also think of 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.000
 4.5 inches small but has a good 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.000
 here at least in this 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.699
 size or resolution of 800 480 not 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.410
 it makes so much difference 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.780
 not tell me enter the menu 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.150
 settings to check the 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.789
 storage 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.490
 see that it has four internal gigs and 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:30.180
 here the phone is indicating a point 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:32.070
 72 gigs of total space and 1,091 space 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.000
 available this here make a problem 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.039
 huh 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.889
 Of course you can expand with micro sd 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.530
 and everything else but we never wait so long 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.849
 little memory when it comes android 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.650
 which comes from the factory or 4.4.2 keké that 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.950
 Let's give her a change here to open it. 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.159
 there android 4.4.2 in the latest version 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.820
 even a rather 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.030
 satisfactory 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.970
 let's go 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.730
 on the camera icon to take that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.280
 traditional fotinho best place of 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.960
 photos or any that yes 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.300
 activate actions or cancel then I do not want 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.830
 mess up a lot at the time of 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.260
 put these deals here does not exist 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.750
 is there so much focus when I play is 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.980
 that he is trying to give focused 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.980
 Let's have the photo. 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.140
 the camera is not the fastest 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:38.590
 He fought hard enough to get here in the 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:42.600
 ideal focus and after pressing it 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.600
 it takes a while to take a photo 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.660
 You just checked the 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.630
 on the screen and will already have a 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.120
 initial print is not that the size 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.380
 for many people it can be very good 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.330
 4.5 né 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.850
 although it has fairly large borders 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.350
 above maybe what seems to be 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.430
 smaller but ultimately each culture has its 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.710
 feature has happened 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.030
 many the sony xperia z3 store by 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.950
 example is a top of the line also though 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.470
 the big ones up and down 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.570
 I'll use this phone with two 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.030
 chips for a while before making the 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.860
 analysis leave campus comments 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.560
 questions that you may eventually have 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:27.010
 about xperia is 3 and suddenly I can 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.560
 answer within the review is inside 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.660
 of the analysis video today I'm staying for 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.550

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:42.030

 Leave a hug for you and say
