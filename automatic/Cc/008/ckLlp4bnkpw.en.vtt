looks<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:52.860> seven<00:00:53.430> pounds

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
looks like we have about seven pounds

looks like we have about seven pounds
now<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.660> important<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.860> an

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.290 
the seasoning as well as the cure unit
and<00:01:21.560> they<00:01:21.860> even<00:01:22.250> break<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.729> down<00:01:22.909> into<00:01:23.210> two

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
and they even break it down into two

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.050 
and they even break it down into two
separate<00:01:24.080> batches<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:25.070> way<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.580> can<00:01:25.850> make

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
separate batches that way you can make

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.910 
separate batches that way you can make
small<00:01:26.479> amounts<00:01:26.930> each<00:01:27.110> time

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
small amounts each time

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.950 
small amounts each time
now<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.280> very<00:01:28.460> difficult<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:29.180> find<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.659> set<00:01:29.930> of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
accurately because you really need a set

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.420 
accurately because you really need a set
the<00:01:34.909> ways<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.509> ounces<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.190> purchase

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
the ways and ounces now you can purchase

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.880 
the ways and ounces now you can purchase
those<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.180> what<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:38.360> like<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.590> actually

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
those but what I like to do is actually

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.249 
those but what I like to do is actually
just<00:01:40.130> use<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> measuring<00:01:41.090> cup<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.930> I'll

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
just use a measuring cup here and I'll

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.770 
just use a measuring cup here and I'll
take<00:01:42.500> all<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:42.800> Curie<00:01:43.340> in<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.610> packet<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.360> then

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
take all my Curie in a packet and then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.290 
take all my Curie in a packet and then
I'll<00:01:44.929> take<00:01:45.200> my<00:01:45.410> seasonings<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.850> just
