00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
let's get started so what I'm doing

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
let's get started so what I'm doing
first<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.239> adding<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.230> three<00:00:43.469> main

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
first is just adding the three main

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
first is just adding the three main
ingredients<00:00:44.219> pretty<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> need<00:00:45.570> into

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
ingredients pretty much you need into

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
ingredients pretty much you need into
the<00:00:46.140> measuring<00:00:46.410> cup<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:47.969> cut

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the measuring cup so you can just cut

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
the measuring cup so you can just cut
off<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.070> little

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
off just a little bit just like a little

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
off just a little bit just like a little
it<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> both<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it a little bit just of both your

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
it a little bit just of both your
lipstick<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.370> wasting<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> whole

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
lipstick so you're not wasting the whole

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
lipstick so you're not wasting the whole
thing<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> chop<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> whole

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
thing and then just chop off the whole

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
thing and then just chop off the whole
thing<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.730> chopstick<00:00:57.239> after<00:00:58.140> you're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
thing of your chopstick after you're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
thing of your chopstick after you're
done<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.850> in

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
done that you're gonna want to put it in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.310 
done that you're gonna want to put it in
the<00:01:00.210> microwave<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:01.129> about<00:01:02.129> 20<00:01:02.910> seconds<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.870> put

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the microwave for about 20 seconds I put

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
the microwave for about 20 seconds I put
it<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.680> 20<00:01:04.739> seconds<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.150> had<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it in for 20 seconds and I had to do a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.289 
it in for 20 seconds and I had to do a
little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.900> longer<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> seem<00:01:08.909> here

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
little bit longer but as you seem here

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
little bit longer but as you seem here
I'm<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.540> putting<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.290> choose<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.860> about

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I'm just putting it in choose for about

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
I'm just putting it in choose for about
20<00:01:11.400> seconds<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.659> let

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
20 seconds and you're just gonna let

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.219 
20 seconds and you're just gonna let
that<00:01:13.770> cook<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> heat<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that cook and heat up a little bit so it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.080 
that cook and heat up a little bit so it
becomes<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> liquid<00:01:17.340> consistency

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.160 

so<00:01:24.090> once<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:25.079> gonna

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so once you take it out you're gonna

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
so once you take it out you're gonna
grab<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> fork<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.189> whisk<00:01:26.579> or<00:01:26.909> anything<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
grab a fork or whisk or anything of that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
grab a fork or whisk or anything of that
nature<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> kind<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> swish<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> around

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
nature just to kind of swish it around

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
nature just to kind of swish it around
or<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> mix<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> around<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.950> actually

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
or kind of mix it around and I actually

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
or kind of mix it around and I actually
had<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.850> another<00:01:33.060> maybe<00:01:34.020> good

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
had to put in for another maybe good

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.139 
had to put in for another maybe good
minute<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.399> because<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> wasn't<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> right

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
minute just because it wasn't the right

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.330 
minute just because it wasn't the right
consistency<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.890> came<00:01:38.039> out<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
consistency so then one that came out of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.389 
consistency so then one that came out of
the<00:01:38.640> microwave<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.619> bit

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
the microwave now it got a little bit

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.210 
the microwave now it got a little bit
more<00:01:41.759> liquidy<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.080> easier<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
more liquidy so it was easier to kind of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
more liquidy so it was easier to kind of
pour<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.470> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pour in as you can see here I'm just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.230 
pour in as you can see here I'm just
mixing<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> consistency

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
mixing it and this is the consistency

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
mixing it and this is the consistency
that<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.049> came<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.920> really

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that it came out as which I really

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.319 
that it came out as which I really
really<00:01:50.399> liked<00:01:50.610> because<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.119> weight

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
really liked because it was weight

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
really liked because it was weight
easier<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> pour<00:01:52.110> into<00:01:52.350> back<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> lip

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
easier to pour into back into the lip

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.020 
easier to pour into back into the lip
balm<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.319> thick<00:01:55.560> consistency<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
balm then the thick consistency and this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.059 
balm then the thick consistency and this
part<00:01:57.270> gets<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.630> messy<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.649> kind

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
part gets a little messy but it's kind

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.179 
part gets a little messy but it's kind
