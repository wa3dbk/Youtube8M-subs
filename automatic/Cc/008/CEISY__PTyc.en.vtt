snowball<00:01:16.680> starts<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.610> rolling<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
snowball starts to get rolling so you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.950 
snowball starts to get rolling so you
know<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.500> getting<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:20.009> call<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.460> was

definitely<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> gut-wrenching<00:01:22.259> feeling<00:01:22.950> but

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
definitely a gut-wrenching feeling but

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
definitely a gut-wrenching feeling but
in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> long<00:01:25.229> run<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.250> what

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
