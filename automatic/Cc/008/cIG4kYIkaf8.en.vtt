00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.830
 hi everyone guys finally came out 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 here we are in the company of a mediator not 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 we lose more time 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 as you can see on the left ie 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.800
 broker with the skin sandstorm here and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'm with the eco doing skin base 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570
 ctrl a small one so in ha to say from 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.330
 to add 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.620
 you will find the baby version of tecco ok 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.850
 now we transform the normal version and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's say right away that this is a champions 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.800
 from middle to ap scale obviously 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 surely we will find a way to use it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 in others the eni as can be the top 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 maybe the jungle with some difficulty 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 but in my opinion it can be used in others 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.969
 laynes with the we dash with enthusiasm 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 but mainly know that it is a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.399
 meet liner right away that sheet 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.500
 say before describing the sample in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 detail is the fact that when 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 unblock the ulti 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.610
 you will have the perennial couple behind you 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 ok I'll show you right away why then 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.310
 I don't feel like coming back later on this one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.900
 thing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.610
 as you can see she will always be active 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.960
 behind you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.290
 and this thing will only create 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 chaos also wools also in the wool phase 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.909
 if this thing they took away and left 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.220
 just that we went back in the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.900
 time or if you really want to put it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.240
 only when multi TV is activated 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 as as where it is activated twice 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.009
 I am reminded of the cultivate resigns dt 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 been would have been much better in 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 In this case we will always have a clone 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.369
 of us behind the words of cali snake 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 if it were as you say it would be bad 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.409
 he hates i know but girl would have that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.790
 ago the king was just a chaos counting 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.250
 that I can also see that of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810
 enemy we're going to see four 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.939
 characters always the lane 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.820
 in practice after level 6 then 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.869
 however small personal thing that goes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.939
 well if it creates chaos 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.360
 anyway let's go immediately to explain here 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 starting from the passive which is not 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 nothing else 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 putting the mark on our enemy 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 has reached three 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.869
 he yes if he wears and we will have a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.319
 noticeable increase in speed 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.080
 nice to the exact then the prosecution go to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.200
 describes our ninja peppe ok raku 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 practically pulls or this scoop creates 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.610
 two parade two parts the first that goes into 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.830
 ahead it opens up a little in that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 area and then come back and when you 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.299
 come back it does more damage but not 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 slogan when we come to our place 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.209
 let's take it at the beginning 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.069
 on the water then no yes no sorry I read 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.840
 now but only when it opens then 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.819
 so does the oasis have had that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 which is taken from when it opens to ok 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.660
 perfect so slow is only in 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.690
 that part that has expanded and then 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.670
 let's immediately describe the w I do it 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.940
 see before I only have lynch inside 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.040
 because in a few steps the w if we pull the w 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.150
 and there is only the enemy inside the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 enemy will be dislocated and that's it 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.010
 ninja will now tell me the w in the head and center 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.190
 he too I will be out of tune and he 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.040
 will receive a large increase in shield 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.150
 in short, he will receive a great shield 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.519
 and from and the dash to even a palau 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.799
 attack makes a little is born like this 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.169
 next attack for years beside henge 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.150
 and succeed academic I was 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.889
 precede the initial connections is now 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.959
 a fixed gas so I want to do it 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.200
 military to stop side attack as 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.819
 you see it's a pretty tragic attack could 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.819
 be the basic auto attack ray 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.810
 were it not 475 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.370
 anyway now i'm walking because you 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.530
 I will show the ultimate as you see the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.120
 high school I 'm at summer midsummer are you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.370
 near or castles if I press them leaves 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.709
 called I do a little damage ok because 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.560
 tv also gave life 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.379
 if we get the r when ninja maybe 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.510
 he stands next to my clone go chest 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.280
 chest affection chest 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.590
 I go around, I go around six times 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.690
 in care of care based on the damage that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 prizes in 4 seconds at the club 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.489
 however, if I now find them again 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.919
 I go here and resume the life and more 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.539
 I do damage to him too 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.949
 so it brings us back now becomes where it is 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.300
 our problems a bit of harm that 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.300

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.270
 got a bit so perfect 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.100
 anyway guys this is definitely there 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.150
