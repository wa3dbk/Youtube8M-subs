00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
film this painting because I took my

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.910 
film this painting because I took my
time<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.900> added<00:00:13.080> layers<00:00:13.410> over<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
time with it and I added layers over the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.860 
time with it and I added layers over the
course<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.250> several<00:00:14.490> days<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.389> didn't<00:00:15.690> want

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
course of several days and I didn't want

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.720 
course of several days and I didn't want
to<00:00:16.080> worry<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.440> camera<00:00:16.920> angles<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.369> filming

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to worry about camera angles or filming

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
to worry about camera angles or filming
or<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.720> didn't<00:00:19.020> want<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
or just I didn't want to have that in

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.050 
or just I didn't want to have that in
the<00:00:19.590> back<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:19.920> head<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.460> sometimes<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the back of my head because sometimes it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.840 
the back of my head because sometimes it
does<00:00:21.300> interfere<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.350> creative<00:00:22.710> flow<00:00:22.890> but

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
does interfere with my creative flow but

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.429 
does interfere with my creative flow but
when<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.720> paint<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> actual

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
when it was time to paint the actual

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.009 
when it was time to paint the actual
bubbles<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.039> decided<00:00:26.580> why<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.869> gonna

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
