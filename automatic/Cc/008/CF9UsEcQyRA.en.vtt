market or open app MKT and basically
this<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.850> web-based<00:00:45.590> application<00:00:46.590> which

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
this is a web-based application which

allows you to install third-party

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
allows you to install third-party
applications<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> axle

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
applications very much like the axle

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.750 
applications very much like the axle
very<00:00:51.390> much<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.780> cydia<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.440> seen<00:00:53.309> stole<00:00:53.579> all

said this is all web based so there's no
need<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.949> an<00:01:05.549> application<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.420> actually

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
need for an application to be actually

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.770 
need for an application to be actually
installed<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.920> done<00:01:08.159> via<00:01:08.460> safari<00:01:08.780> which

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
guys come up with the application it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
guys come up with the application it's
pretty<00:01:16.950> cool<00:01:17.070> open<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> market<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.900> good

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pretty cool open that market really good

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.219 
pretty cool open that market really good
idea<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.979> um<00:01:20.509> before<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> app<00:01:21.930> stores

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
idea now um before the app stores

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.920 
idea now um before the app stores
actually<00:01:22.380> released<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.100> jobs<00:01:23.490> was

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
actually released these jobs was

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.480 
actually released these jobs was
focusing<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> application<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> be

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
focusing on all the application to be

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
focusing on all the application to be
web-based<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.270> everything<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
web-based and everything like that but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
web-based and everything like that but
he<00:01:28.950> sort<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.250> drifted<00:01:29.610> off<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
he sort of drifted off from that and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.640 
he sort of drifted off from that and
came<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> App<00:01:31.110> Store<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> now

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
came up with the App Store and now

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
came up with the App Store and now
everyone<00:01:32.070> uses<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> App<00:01:33.000> Store<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> um<00:01:35.210> open

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everyone uses the App Store so um open

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
everyone uses the App Store so um open
app<00:01:36.450> MKT<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.439> basically<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> place<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
app MKT is basically a place for all the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
app MKT is basically a place for all the
web<00:01:39.030> based<00:01:39.329> applications<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
web based applications it's all in one

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
web based applications it's all in one
basically<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.710> free

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
basically now there are free

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
basically now there are free
applications<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:44.909> paid<00:01:45.329> applications

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
applications there are paid applications

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.929 
applications there are paid applications
so<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.790> App<00:01:47.909> Store

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
so it's pretty much like the App Store

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.149 
so it's pretty much like the App Store
but<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> said<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.259> web-based<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.009> all

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
but like I said for web-based it's all

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
but like I said for web-based it's all
done<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.149> formatted<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.960> html5

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
done and it's all formatted in html5

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
done and it's all formatted in html5
which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.850> cool<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.360> shows

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
which is really cool and it just shows

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.350 
which is really cool and it just shows
some<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> capabilities<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.729> html5<00:01:56.729> with

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
some of the capabilities of html5 with

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.200 
some of the capabilities of html5 with
these<00:01:57.540> applications<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.799> good

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
these applications they are really good

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
these applications they are really good
tested<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> few<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:02.070> that's

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
tested a few out so basically that's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
tested a few out so basically that's
that<00:02:03.299> okay<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.409> definitely

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that okay so this is definitely

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
that okay so this is definitely
something<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.490> gonna<00:02:05.610> take<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
something I think it's gonna take off in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.990 
something I think it's gonna take off in
the<00:02:07.020> near<00:02:07.170> future<00:02:07.520> currently<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> moment

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the near future currently at the moment

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.609 
the near future currently at the moment
there<00:02:09.119> isn't<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:09.450> many<00:02:09.810> applications<00:02:10.470> on

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
there isn't very many applications on

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
there isn't very many applications on
there<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.810> understood

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
there but that is to be understood

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
there but that is to be understood
really<00:02:13.500> because

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
going to see a lot more of this in

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.340 
going to see a lot more of this in
something<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.820> also<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.270> pretty<00:03:03.570> cool<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
something I also think pretty cool that

thirty percent of the payment may only
take<00:03:15.480> twenty<00:03:16.140> percent<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.010> definite<00:03:17.970> plus
