day<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.260> managed<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> set<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.730> there

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
day we managed to set that up so there

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
day we managed to set that up so there
is<00:00:36.059> actually<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> working<00:00:36.840> economy<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
is actually a working economy now on the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.420 
is actually a working economy now on the
server<00:00:39.500> we<00:00:40.500> decided<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> one

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
server we decided to go with this one

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
server we decided to go with this one
because<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> doesn't<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.390> items<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.290> currency

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
because it doesn't use items as currency

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.470 
because it doesn't use items as currency
so<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.280> used<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> gold<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.090> anything

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so it's not used in gold or anything

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
so it's not used in gold or anything
it's<00:00:45.690> using<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> fake<00:00:47.239> virtual

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it's using just like a fake virtual

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
it's using just like a fake virtual
currency<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.289> only<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.160> checked<00:00:50.550> with

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
currency that can only be checked with

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
currency that can only be checked with
commands<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.570> /<00:00:54.570> balance<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.920> check

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
commands so like / balance is to check

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
commands so like / balance is to check
your<00:00:56.250> balance<00:00:56.399> stuff<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.899> you're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
your balance stuff like that so you're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.729 
your balance stuff like that so you're
basically<00:00:58.920> given<00:00:59.609> money<00:00:59.850> only<00:01:00.390> by<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.350> admins

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
basically given money only by the admins

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.820 
basically given money only by the admins
