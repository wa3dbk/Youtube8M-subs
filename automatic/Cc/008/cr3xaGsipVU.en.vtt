00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
attached to that actually makes a really
pretty<00:01:39.990> little<00:01:40.289> necklace<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.509> love<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pretty little necklace now I love the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.209 
pretty little necklace now I love the
locks<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.560> they're<00:01:43.679> really<00:01:43.829> decorative

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
locks I think they're really decorative

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.859 
locks I think they're really decorative
and<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.789> think<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.299> wear<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and I think you can wear them on the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
and I think you can wear them on the
side<00:01:46.079> I've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> plain<00:01:47.939> chain

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
side I've got just the plain chain

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.020 
side I've got just the plain chain
necklace<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> saw<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
necklace that you saw there and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
necklace that you saw there and
sometimes<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.689> wear<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> longer<00:01:52.399> I'll<00:01:53.399> click

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
sometimes to wear it longer I'll click

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
sometimes to wear it longer I'll click
my<00:01:53.729> bracelet<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.990> wear<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.319> two<00:01:55.500> locks

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
my bracelet and then wear the two locks

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
my bracelet and then wear the two locks
at<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> side<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:56.969> obviously<00:01:57.270> beat<00:01:57.659> at

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
at the side and then obviously beat at

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.609 
at the side and then obviously beat at
the<00:01:57.959> bottom<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.989> it<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.289> does

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the bottom so I think it really does

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.899 
the bottom so I think it really does

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.970 
put them in sort of if you have got
matching<00:04:12.900> ones<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.200> light<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.740> dark

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
matching ones in light and dark

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.160 
matching ones in light and dark
contrasting<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:14.940> you've<00:04:15.060> got<00:04:15.210> too<00:04:15.480> dark<00:04:15.660> too

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
contrasting so you've got too dark too

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.990 
contrasting so you've got too dark too
light<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.710> a<00:04:16.800> dark<00:04:16.830> it<00:04:17.550> just<00:04:17.610> looks<00:04:17.850> really

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
light and a dark it just looks really

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.229 
light and a dark it just looks really
nice<00:04:18.239> about<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.690> rather<00:04:18.930> than<00:04:19.760> two<00:04:20.760> like<00:04:20.940> and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
nice about that rather than two like and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.310 
nice about that rather than two like and
then<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.420> dark<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.840> middle<00:04:21.900> extend<00:04:22.230> it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
then all dark in the middle extend it

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.490 
then all dark in the middle extend it
makes<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> focal<00:04:22.920> point<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.190> center

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.750 

silverbeet<00:04:28.560> if<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.130> once<00:04:29.430> again<00:04:29.550> if<00:04:29.670> you

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
silverbeet if you I once again if you

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.280 
silverbeet if you I once again if you
don't<00:04:29.910> have<00:04:30.030> similar<00:04:30.420> silver<00:04:30.690> beads<00:04:30.870> similar

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
don't have similar silver beads similar

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.490 
don't have similar silver beads similar
in<00:04:31.380> size<00:04:31.620> or<00:04:31.980> shape<00:04:32.010> also<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.640> works<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:34.440> I'm

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
in size or shape also it works so I'm

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
in size or shape also it works so I'm
just<00:04:34.590> gonna<00:04:34.680> do<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:34.980> like<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.400> gets

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
just gonna do it like that so it gets

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.380 
just gonna do it like that so it gets
narrower<00:04:35.850> towards<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.270> middle<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:38.390> easiest

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
narrower towards the middle so easiest

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.700 
narrower towards the middle so easiest
way<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.510> do<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.110> drop<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> chain

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
way to do it is to drop the chain

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.310 
way to do it is to drop the chain
through<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.160> bead<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:44.390> then<00:04:45.390> you<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.690> carry

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
through the bead and then you just carry

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.060 
through the bead and then you just carry
on<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:48.020> I've<00:04:49.020> really<00:04:49.380> loved<00:04:49.530> pups<00:04:49.860> as<00:04:49.980> you
