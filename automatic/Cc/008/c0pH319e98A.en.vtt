another<00:02:10.470> video<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.760> don't

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
another video for that because I don't

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.800 
another video for that because I don't
really<00:02:12.120> need<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
really need to do it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.440 
really need to do it
so<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:14.740> follow<00:02:15.010> my<00:02:15.250> natural<00:02:15.310> shape<00:02:16.090> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so I just follow my natural shape of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
so I just follow my natural shape of
where<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.900> shears<00:02:17.140> are<00:02:17.350> they're<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> bit

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
where the shears are they're just a bit

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.300 
where the shears are they're just a bit
thinner<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.350> screw<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.070> kind<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
thinner if I screw up I just kind of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.850 
thinner if I screw up I just kind of
take<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.120> off<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:25.350> there's<00:02:26.350> no<00:02:26.590> real

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
take it off and then there's no real

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.560 
take it off and then there's no real
technique<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.580> be<00:02:27.670> honest<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.240> kind

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
technique to it to be honest it's kind

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:42.270 
technique to it to be honest it's kind
of<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.970> chocking<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.090> on

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.570 

and<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.480> basically<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.370> one

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
and that is basically it and this one

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.800 
and that is basically it and this one
looks<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.820> bit<00:02:45.850> lighter<00:02:46.120> because<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.690> put

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
looks a bit lighter because I just put

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.150 
looks a bit lighter because I just put
powder<00:02:46.990> on<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:52.300> means<00:02:52.510> sometimes<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.710> my

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
powder on it means sometimes if my

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.730 
powder on it means sometimes if my
eyebrows<00:02:54.580> are<00:02:54.790> being<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.150> unruly<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:56.050> will

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
eyebrows are being very unruly I will

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.130 
eyebrows are being very unruly I will
use<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.220> elf<00:02:57.610> kind<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.270> clear<00:02:58.510> mascara<00:02:58.720> crack

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
use the elf kind of clear mascara crack

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.800 
use the elf kind of clear mascara crack
and<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.340> don't<00:03:00.459> use<00:03:00.850> too<00:03:01.030> much<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.510> because

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
and I don't use too much of this because

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.330 
and I don't use too much of this because
I<00:03:01.900> find<00:03:02.140> if<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.320> put<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.560> too<00:03:02.650> much<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.100> kind<00:03:03.310> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
I find if you put on too much it kind of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.680 
I find if you put on too much it kind of
just<00:03:03.400> wipes<00:03:03.730> off<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.060> color<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.420> makes<00:03:04.540> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
just wipes off the color it makes it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.930 
just wipes off the color it makes it
look<00:03:04.810> really<00:03:04.990> really<00:03:05.290> gross<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.400> I'm<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.850> a
