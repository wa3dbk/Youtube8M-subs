 that I can feast fast food without 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460

 Lisa explains something special 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.239
 on serving david so so nowadays is 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.369
 it's easy for many working people 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 difficult somewhere fast healthy 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.979

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.020
 Lunch break then the time too 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.539

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.550
 the idea came to the founder david 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.619
 BaumgÃ¤rtner on a world tour 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.119

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.470
 Country concept developed for the david 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.970
