00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
ball at all at this point I'm already in

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.320 
ball at all at this point I'm already in
a<00:05:36.830> field<00:05:37.830> goal<00:05:38.010> range<00:05:38.160> but<00:05:38.460> what<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.090> gotta

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
a field goal range but what I gotta

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.270 
a field goal range but what I gotta
think<00:05:39.540> about<00:05:39.720> is<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.200> if<00:05:40.260> he<00:05:40.530> actually<00:05:40.800> goes

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
think about is that if he actually goes

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.770 
think about is that if he actually goes
for<00:05:41.520> two<00:05:41.640> point<00:05:41.850> conversion<00:05:41.970> twice<00:05:42.480> it<00:05:42.660> could

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
for two point conversion twice it could

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.450 
for two point conversion twice it could
actually<00:05:42.900> tie<00:05:43.230> up<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.470> game<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.370> know

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
actually tie up the game so you know

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.890 
actually tie up the game so you know
trying<00:05:44.790> to<00:05:44.820> just<00:05:45.030> move<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.330> ball<00:05:45.510> right<00:05:45.630> here

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140
