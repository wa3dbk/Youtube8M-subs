 detailing everything but all good now yes 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.100
 start higher today I bring you a 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.190
 different way of salt the roast I will 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.979
 prepare a homemade brine to pure pure 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.960
 flavor a lot of people think thank you was not 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.180
 it only serves to save the flesh that is 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 the pitcher to the cross but you are like that 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.649
 they can salt anything even to the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.170
 grill today we are going to make this piece 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.270
 of vacuum and we are going to talk and taste 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 for our samuel for the brine of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.760
 today we are going to use a glass bottle 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.990
 of plastic 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:34.110
 warm water coarse salt garlic rosemary fresh 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 fresh thyme oregano fresh chili 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.070
 ground laurel and white pepper not 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.270
 you can use the brine is that not only 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.920
 is going to salt flavor the meat but that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.290
 we're going to hydrate it and we're going to hydrate 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.450
 well and that what allows then the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.300
 meat comes out well tender that is cut with 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 we can cook the part 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.560
 others we can get it well cooked and goes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.440
 to leave exactly the same a mourning 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.479
 winners as you want deprivation the most 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.510
 most important in this recipe that is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.670
 calculate how much water and how much salt we're going 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.560
 to use for brine a measure 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 of reference more or less dried half 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.970
 liter of water 50 grams of salt of all 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 ways I recommend that you 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.340
 look and then try it little of 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.590
 water put the salt and try it since 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.920
 everyone may like saltier or 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.840
 less 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.030
 the taste has to be a salt water 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.680
 but you do not have to use paris either 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.130
 because if not then it will go to the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.660
 meat we put the garlic can be 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 so with the shell nothing happens at all 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.530
 then we will not take it 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.879
 [Music] 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040
 so we put the ground chili 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 Pepper 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 and now the frescoes 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.630
 eat or 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.010
 the oregano 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.580
 the aromas 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.330
 [Music] 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.330
 the same 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.770
 the same recipe you can make with 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.770
 spices 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.670
 They exist dry but good always 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.290
 they use fresh is going to have a lot more flavor 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.819
 [Music] 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.819
 we put 2 laurel leaves 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.320
 [Music] 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.660
 we look down 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.080
 [Music] 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.030
 and now if we add the warm water is 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.240
 important that the water is warm because 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.160
 not only will help the whole salt 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.390
 faster ground but it's going to lead to 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.390
 mix all the ingredients 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.110
 we press well 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 is 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.630
 we beat a little bit and then we leave it 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.980
 rest 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.690
 so that all the ingredients are 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.670
 mix 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.859
 and there 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.029
 [Music] 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.639
 let's go susana 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.639
 [Music] 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.069
 [Music] 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.800
 when the vacuum is witness in the part 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.170
 from above it 's time to throw the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 pickle because it 's just when it starts 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.540
 to perspire 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.540
 the more you will absorb 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.790
 [Music] 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.980
 the bell warns about the morning that 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.850
 the burned radiation will not incinerate 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:13.970
 that matter the moon we only had one if 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.970
 we become so gross the most sincere 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:25.860
 [Music] 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.620
 ideal really also well tender 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.020
 all the brine opens you feel 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.620
 [Music] 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.620
