her and so we're having the ebike

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.120 
her and so we're having the ebike
definitely<00:01:05.600> helps<00:01:05.780> motor<00:01:06.080> pacing<00:01:06.500> that's<00:01:07.010> why

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
definitely helps motor pacing that's why

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.550 
definitely helps motor pacing that's why
pro<00:01:07.340> riders<00:01:07.640> had<00:01:07.760> motor<00:01:07.970> paces<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:09.140> neat<00:01:09.380> see

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
pro riders had motor paces is neat see

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.920 
pro riders had motor paces is neat see
the<00:01:10.220> next<00:01:10.430> level<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.270> he's<00:01:11.390> done<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.570> past<00:01:11.750> a
