we're<00:02:45.450> probably<00:02:45.630> less<00:02:45.930> likely<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.380> out<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
we're probably less likely to go out and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
we're probably less likely to go out and
get<00:02:46.740> wasted<00:02:46.950> stay<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.460> till<00:02:47.610> 2:00<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.790> the

which is interesting another factor is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.310
