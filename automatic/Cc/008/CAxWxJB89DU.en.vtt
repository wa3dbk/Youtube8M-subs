today I'm going to explain the 90 degree
rule<00:00:03.360> 90<00:00:04.259> degree<00:00:04.470> rule<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.390> when<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.480> hit

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
rule 90 degree rule is that when you hit

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.839 
rule 90 degree rule is that when you hit

degrees<00:00:10.860> away<00:00:11.040> from<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.519> if<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.450> hit<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.660> from

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
degrees away from it if you hit it from

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.450 
degrees away from it if you hit it from
this<00:00:12.929> way<00:00:13.110> he<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> go<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.190> way<00:00:14.340> at

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this way he was going to go that way at

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.490 
this way he was going to go that way at
90<00:00:14.639> degrees<00:00:14.940> cut<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.049> way<00:00:16.230> it's

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
going to go this way at 90 degrees

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.050 
going to go this way at 90 degrees
here's<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> demonstration<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.490> center<00:00:20.880> ball

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
here's a demonstration with center ball

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
here's a demonstration with center ball
on<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:27.050> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> traveled<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.099> 90

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
on it you can see that it traveled at 90

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
on it you can see that it traveled at 90
degrees<00:00:29.670> away<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> path<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
degrees away from from the path to the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.100 
degrees away from from the path to the
pocket<00:00:32.059> now<00:00:33.059> follow<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.540> draw<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
pocket now follow and draw are going to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.780 
pocket now follow and draw are going to
change<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.100> follow<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> it's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
change that if you put follow on it it's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
change that if you put follow on it it's
actually<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> close<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> angle<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
actually going to close the angle and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
actually going to close the angle and
make<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> cue<00:00:38.670> ball<00:00:38.820> follow<00:00:39.210> towards<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
make the cue ball follow towards the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
make the cue ball follow towards the
ball<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.230> opposed<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> coming<00:00:41.309> away<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.610> 90

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
ball as opposed to coming away at 90

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
ball as opposed to coming away at 90
degrees<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.170> here's<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> follow<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:48.950> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
degrees and here's the follow on it you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.380 
degrees and here's the follow on it you
can<00:00:50.129> see<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.430> angle<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.879> less<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.149> 90

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
can see that angle is less than 90

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.810 
can see that angle is less than 90
degrees

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
degrees

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.979 
degrees
now<00:00:53.820> draw<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> opposite

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
now draw is going to do the opposite

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
now draw is going to do the opposite
it's<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> open<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> angle<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it's going to open the angle and make it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's going to open the angle and make it
greater<00:00:57.809> than<00:00:57.899> 90<00:00:58.320> degrees<00:01:05.030> all<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.180> now

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
greater than 90 degrees all right now

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
greater than 90 degrees all right now
here's<00:01:06.510> what's<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> why<00:01:07.700> draw

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
here's what's going on this is why draw

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
here's what's going on this is why draw
and<00:01:08.880> follow<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> effect<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and follow have this effect on it with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
and follow have this effect on it with
center<00:01:11.070> ball<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> cue<00:01:11.670> ball<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> actually

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
center ball the cue ball is actually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
center ball the cue ball is actually
sliding<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> cloth<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> hit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
sliding on the cloth it's going to hit

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
sliding on the cloth it's going to hit
it<00:01:14.939> send<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.659> 90<00:01:15.900> degrees<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.770> going

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it send it at 90 degrees and it's going

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
it send it at 90 degrees and it's going
to<00:01:16.950> come<00:01:17.159> straight<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.640> way<00:01:17.700> 90<00:01:18.150> degrees

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to come straight this way 90 degrees

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
to come straight this way 90 degrees
away<00:01:18.920> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.220> follow<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
away when you put follow on it it's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.140 
away when you put follow on it it's
rolling<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.400> hits<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> still

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
rolling so it actually hits it it still

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
rolling so it actually hits it it still
comes<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.659> 90<00:01:24.869> degrees<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
comes off at 90 degrees but only for a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
comes off at 90 degrees but only for a
split<00:01:26.490> second<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
split second because it's going to be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
split second because it's going to be
rolling<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> curve

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
rolling this way it's going to curve

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.830 
rolling this way it's going to curve
forward<00:01:30.890> let's<00:01:31.890> draw<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
forward let's draw on it it's actually

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
forward let's draw on it it's actually
rolling<00:01:34.020> backwards<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.710> its<00:01:34.890> sliding<00:01:35.100> it's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
rolling backwards as its sliding it's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
rolling backwards as its sliding it's
going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> hit<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> still<00:01:36.600> come<00:01:36.750> off<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.020> 90

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
going to hit it still come off at 90

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
going to hit it still come off at 90
degrees<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.770> again<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> split

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
degrees but again only for a split

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
degrees but again only for a split
second<00:01:39.420> until<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> draw<00:01:40.140> takes<00:01:40.409> over<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
second until the draw takes over and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
second until the draw takes over and
actually<00:01:41.340> opens<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.850> angle<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:45.049> all<00:01:46.049> right

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
actually opens that angle up all right

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.480 
actually opens that angle up all right
this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> shot<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.340> bit

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this is a shot that can get a little bit

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
this is a shot that can get a little bit
confusing<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> 90<00:01:48.540> degree<00:01:48.810> roll<00:01:49.040> what<00:01:50.040> I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
confusing with a 90 degree roll what I'm

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
confusing with a 90 degree roll what I'm
going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> hit<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> cue<00:01:50.939> ball<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> center

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
going to do is hit the cue ball a center

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.170 
going to do is hit the cue ball a center
ball<00:01:51.720> pocket<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.729> corner

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
ball pocket the two in that corner

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.240 
ball pocket the two in that corner
because<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.290> center<00:01:55.560> ball<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> would<00:01:55.920> expect

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
because the center ball you would expect

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
because the center ball you would expect
it<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> come<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.939> 90<00:01:57.180> degrees<00:01:57.450> what's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it to come off at 90 degrees what's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
it to come off at 90 degrees what's
actually<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> happen<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.430> cue<00:01:59.610> ball

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
actually going to happen is the cue ball

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
actually going to happen is the cue ball
will<00:01:59.939> pick<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.780> forward<00:02:01.200> roll<00:02:01.409> because

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
will pick up some forward roll because

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
will pick up some forward roll because
of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> friction<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> cloth<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of the friction of the cloth so it's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
of the friction of the cloth so it's
actually<00:02:03.990> rather<00:02:04.170> than

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
actually rather than

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:13.060 
actually rather than
I'm<00:02:04.670> going<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.120> follow<00:02:05.780> on<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:12.710> can<00:02:12.890> see

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
I'm going to follow on it you can see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.320 
I'm going to follow on it you can see
that<00:02:13.280> even<00:02:13.400> though<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> hit<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:13.970> Center

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
that even though I hit it with Center

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.150 
that even though I hit it with Center
the<00:02:14.900> Engel<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.350> lot<00:02:15.530> less<00:02:15.710> than<00:02:15.860> 90<00:02:16.070> degrees

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the Engel is a lot less than 90 degrees

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
the Engel is a lot less than 90 degrees
because<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.850> roll<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.360> picked<00:02:17.600> up<00:02:17.690> along

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
because of the roll it picked up along

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.190 
because of the roll it picked up along
the<00:02:17.960> way

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
the way

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.650 
the way
creating<00:02:18.920> follow<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.270> don't<00:02:20.420> want<00:02:20.570> this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
creating follow if you don't want this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.480 
creating follow if you don't want this
to<00:02:20.810> happen<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.890> actually<00:02:22.010> hit<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> little

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
to happen you can actually hit a little

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.420 
to happen you can actually hit a little
bit<00:02:22.640> low<00:02:22.820> on<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.510> cue<00:02:23.660> ball<00:02:24.220> starting<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.310> off

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
bit low on the cue ball starting it off

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.860 
bit low on the cue ball starting it off
with<00:02:25.460> draw<00:02:25.820> by<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.270> time<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.600> reaches<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
with draw by the time it reaches the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.280 
with draw by the time it reaches the
object<00:02:27.260> ball<00:02:27.440> it'll<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.670> sliding<00:02:29.150> as<00:02:29.300> if

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
object ball it'll just be sliding as if

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
object ball it'll just be sliding as if
I<00:02:30.380> hit<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> center<00:02:31.070> ball<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.840> make<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.170> come<00:02:33.350> off

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
I hit a center ball to make it come off

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.160 
I hit a center ball to make it come off
at<00:02:33.620> 90<00:02:33.860> degrees
