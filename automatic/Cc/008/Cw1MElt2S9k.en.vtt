00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and develop rates as we go through the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.279 
and develop rates as we go through the
matches<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:59.390> will<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.539> check<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> King<00:01:01.050> ticks

just<00:02:01.469> give<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> him<00:02:02.009> okay<00:02:02.340> they're<00:02:02.520> really

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
just give it to him okay they're really

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.120 
just give it to him okay they're really
small<00:02:03.000> pots<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.479> no<00:02:03.630> need<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.049> us<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:05.009> do

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
small pots is no need for us to to do

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
small pots is no need for us to to do
anything<00:02:05.460> until<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.119> develop<00:02:06.539> reeds

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
anything until we really develop reeds

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
anything until we really develop reeds
and<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.170> work<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and really work out what he's going to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.230 
and really work out what he's going to
how<00:02:08.250> he's<00:02:08.430> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> react<00:02:08.910> through<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
how he's going to react through the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.550 
how he's going to react through the
match<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.630> what<00:02:09.869> type<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> player<00:02:10.530> he

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
match and what type of player he

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.700 
match and what type of player he
actually<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.990> then<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.440> use<00:02:13.470> our

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
actually is and then we can use our

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.170 
actually is and then we can use our
knowledge<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.400> textures<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> take

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
knowledge of for textures and and take

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.030 
knowledge of for textures and and take
certain<00:02:18.510> lines<00:02:18.750> guide<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.590> abuse<00:02:19.890> his

certain lines guide to abuse his

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.479 
certain lines guide to abuse his
tendencies<00:02:21.680> okay<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.739> now<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.430> see

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
tendencies okay so now that we can see

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.309 
tendencies okay so now that we can see
that<00:02:23.790> he's<00:02:23.970> limping<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.420> lot

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
that he's limping a lot

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.440 
that he's limping a lot
i'm<00:02:25.499> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> start<00:02:25.950> raising<00:02:26.239> fairly<00:02:27.239> wide

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450

barrel<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> highly<00:02:53.969> doubt<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.480> could

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
barrel here I highly doubt that we could

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.619 
barrel here I highly doubt that we could
but<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.579> quite<00:02:56.909> often<00:02:57.090> players<00:02:57.419> will

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
but you know quite often players will

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.890 
but you know quite often players will
fire<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.169> streets<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.909> that<00:03:00.120> they<00:03:00.329> don't<00:03:00.780> have

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
fire to streets and that they don't have

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.679 
fire to streets and that they don't have
the<00:03:00.989> balls<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.379> five<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.919> barrel<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:03.269> if<00:03:03.540> he

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
the balls to five of the barrel so if he

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.330 
the balls to five of the barrel so if he
did<00:03:03.870> actually<00:03:04.049> fire<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.409> third<00:03:04.799> barrel<00:03:05.129> there

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
did actually fire the third barrel there

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.189 
did actually fire the third barrel there
considering<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.329> he's<00:03:06.540> limped<00:03:06.840> his<00:03:06.930> first

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
considering that he's limped his first

considering that he's limped his first
three<00:03:07.379> buttons<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.799> don't<00:03:08.040> put<00:03:08.219> him<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
three buttons I don't put him in the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.390 
three buttons I don't put him in the
Maineiacs<00:03:08.909> category<00:03:09.719> just<00:03:09.930> yet<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.980> think

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
Maineiacs category just yet I think

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.740 
Maineiacs category just yet I think
we're<00:03:11.519> best<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.000> following<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.510> river

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
we're best to be following that river

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.229 
we're best to be following that river
howdy<00:03:13.199> five<00:03:13.469> the<00:03:13.739> third<00:03:13.949> barrel<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.180> he

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
howdy five the third barrel see what he

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.899 
howdy five the third barrel see what he
had<00:03:16.939> so<00:03:17.939> he<00:03:18.090> had<00:03:18.269> queen<00:03:18.689> three<00:03:18.989> okay<00:03:19.439> so<00:03:19.909> we'll

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
had so he had queen three okay so we'll

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.220 
had so he had queen three okay so we'll
certainly<00:03:21.090> take<00:03:21.359> note<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.780> he<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.989> fly<00:03:22.169> two

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
certainly take note that he can fly two

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.580 
certainly take note that he can fly two
barrels<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:22.859> were<00:03:23.010> there<00:03:24.260> but<00:03:25.260> couldn't

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
barrels they were there but couldn't

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.780 
barrels they were there but couldn't
actually<00:03:25.709> follow<00:03:26.040> through<00:03:26.129> with<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.549> third

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
actually follow through with the third

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.490 
actually follow through with the third
um<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:28.230> we<00:03:28.560> pick<00:03:28.889> up<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.129> drawer<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.579> turn

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
um here we pick up a drawer on the turn

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.569 
um here we pick up a drawer on the turn
you<00:03:31.500> know<00:03:31.620> betting<00:03:31.979> here<00:03:32.159> out<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.340> position

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
you know betting here out of position

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.189 
you know betting here out of position
it's<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> put<00:03:33.299> us<00:03:33.419> in<00:03:33.509> awkward<00:03:33.840> spots<00:03:34.079> if

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's going to put us in awkward spots if

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.990 
it's going to put us in awkward spots if
he<00:03:34.319> calls<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.769> we<00:03:34.829> missed<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.280> river<00:03:35.519> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
he calls and we missed on the river so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.309 
he calls and we missed on the river so
there's<00:03:36.180> no<00:03:36.269> point<00:03:36.509> to<00:03:36.659> do<00:03:36.780> anything<00:03:36.989> silly

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
there's no point to do anything silly

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.330 
there's no point to do anything silly
we're<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> keep<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.949> relatively

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
we're going to keep it relatively

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.920 
we're going to keep it relatively
