00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
what we've done with our body is we've

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.770 
what we've done with our body is we've
tighten<00:02:27.670> up<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> front<00:02:28.090> end<00:02:28.299> here<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.660> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.699 
their narrow and width which is
something<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.480> is<00:04:19.660> unique<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> buggy

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
