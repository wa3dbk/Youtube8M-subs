got there were a dollar and I thought

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
got there were a dollar and I thought
why<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.060> my

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
different things and I thought that'd be

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
different things and I thought that'd be
really<00:01:51.990> cool<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.530> usually<00:01:52.829> never<00:01:53.280> try

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
I don't forget tell but it was just a

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.879 
I don't forget tell but it was just a
bunch<00:05:40.389> of<00:05:40.569> different<00:05:41.020> things<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.710> it's

bunch of different things and it's

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.469

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
really pretty a little bit more

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.150 
really pretty a little bit more
expensive<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:44.259> think<00:05:44.740> this<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.860> like<00:05:44.979> five

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
expensive I think this is like five

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.650 
expensive I think this is like five
bucks<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.819> it's<00:05:45.940> just<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.180> small<00:05:46.449> notebook

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
bucks for it's just a small notebook

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.150 
bucks for it's just a small notebook
it's<00:05:46.930> not<00:05:47.050> like<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.259> really<00:05:47.530> big<00:05:47.680> ones<00:05:47.949> it's

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
it's not like the really big ones it's

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.710 
it's not like the really big ones it's
really<00:05:48.430> small<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:48.849> I<00:05:48.940> thought<00:05:49.210> taking<00:05:49.479> notes

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
really small so I thought taking notes

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.540 
really small so I thought taking notes
and<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.229> would<00:05:50.380> be<00:05:50.410> good<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:51.099> also<00:05:51.250> has<00:05:51.520> a
