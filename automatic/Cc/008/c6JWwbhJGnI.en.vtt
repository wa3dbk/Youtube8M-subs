 from coffee then the web browser 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:29.720
 that's also an Amazon 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:32.470
 In-house development of the world browser can 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.470
 amazon de 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.970
 So far, I have been training quite well 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.410
 still photos and documents too 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.170
 each in the cloud or on the device 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.040
 can be present and offers are in 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.940
 advertising on the lockscreen below 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.940
 other, at least 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.590
 that was so far that amazon gvhd 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.210
 This device is here with 16 gigabytes 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.830
 equipped costs 199 euros there are 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:42.750
 still the 32 gigabyte variant with the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.750
 costs 249 euros 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.910
 short the comparison in size with 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:55.780
 the ipad 2 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:58.630
 there we can see 7 inch display 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.100
 It is said that around half of the user 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.100
 a 7 inch displays 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.710
 So personally, I want the device 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:19.000
 Do not buy it because you just have it here 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.740
 totally caught amazon world and the 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 personally is much too small for me 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.570
 the app store has less choice of it 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.490
 are videos 08 movie books are 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.440
 Ultimately, real advantage of the device 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.229
 it was synonymous to every other android tablet 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.229
 stop the no lab you can there 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.139
 so easily his formation books 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.820
 read 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.270
 so far I would be 7 inches 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.580
 tablet wants to grab the nexus 7 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:53.320
 hold and think I have of yes so 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.810
 my assessment of the amazon no 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.810
 fire hd thanks for the attention
