need in order to take these exams but

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.660 
need in order to take these exams but
we're<00:02:37.939> doing<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.659> a<00:02:38.840> way<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.439> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
we're doing it in a way that is the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.229 
we're doing it in a way that is the
concentrated<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.829> which<00:02:42.829> allows<00:02:43.189> you<00:02:43.549> to

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
concentrated and which allows you to

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.020 
concentrated and which allows you to
study<00:02:44.599> with<00:02:45.549> people<00:02:46.549> who<00:02:46.730> are<00:02:46.819> doing

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
what doing this work at a university

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
what doing this work at a university
does<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.700> brings<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.209> closer

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
does is it brings you in closer

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
Professor Hogan and hovers okay what

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.050 
Professor Hogan and hovers okay what
does<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.739> allow<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.579> allows<00:03:04.819> you

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
does this allow you to do it allows you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.190 
does this allow you to do it allows you
to<00:03:05.180> get<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.359> more<00:03:05.629> enriched<00:03:07.389> command<00:03:08.389> of<00:03:08.689> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
to get a more enriched command of the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.289 
to get a more enriched command of the
field<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:09.769> if<00:03:09.889> what<00:03:10.189> you<00:03:10.549> did<00:03:10.760> was<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:11.090> just

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
field then if what you did was to just

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.920 
field then if what you did was to just
go<00:03:11.480> off<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.639> take<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.669> test<00:03:14.000> prep<00:03:14.329> for<00:03:14.599> it<00:03:14.720> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
go off and take a test prep for it and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.229 
go off and take a test prep for it and
do<00:03:15.229> it<00:03:15.409> so<00:03:16.069> it's<00:03:16.220> really<00:03:16.639> an<00:03:16.819> enriched

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
do it so it's really an enriched

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.580 
do it so it's really an enriched
academic<00:03:18.109> opportunity<00:03:18.919> for<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:20.139> the<00:03:21.139> program

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
academic opportunity for you the program

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.069 
academic opportunity for you the program
is<00:03:21.709> 36<00:03:22.280> points<00:03:22.699> however<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.449> be<00:03:23.599> exempted

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
is 36 points however you can be exempted

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.979 
is 36 points however you can be exempted
from<00:03:24.139> two<00:03:24.699> courses<00:03:25.699> namely<00:03:26.180> six<00:03:26.569> points

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
from two courses namely six points

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.649 
from two courses namely six points
depending<00:03:27.409> on<00:03:27.620> your<00:03:27.889> previous<00:03:28.129> background

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
depending on your previous background

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.509 
depending on your previous background
and<00:03:29.659> that<00:03:29.959> leads<00:03:30.229> me<00:03:30.379> to<00:03:30.590> really<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.159> final

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
and that leads me to really the final

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.949 
and that leads me to really the final
thing<00:03:31.669> I<00:03:31.760> want<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.000> say<00:03:32.090> about<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.599> program

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
thing I want to say about the program

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.140 
thing I want to say about the program
and<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.199> is<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.680> we<00:03:34.370> try<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.699> keep<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and that is that we try to keep the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.140 
and that is that we try to keep the
program<00:03:35.359> eminently<00:03:36.349> flexible<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:37.849> if

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
program eminently flexible so that if

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.360 
program eminently flexible so that if
you<00:03:38.329> bring<00:03:38.629> for<00:03:38.930> example<00:03:39.470> extraordinary

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
you bring for example extraordinary

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.479 
you bring for example extraordinary
strength<00:03:40.819> in<00:03:41.030> mathematics<00:03:41.979> we<00:03:42.979> can<00:03:43.190> work<00:03:43.459> with

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
strength in mathematics we can work with

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.330 
strength in mathematics we can work with
you<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.540> adjust<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:45.079> curriculum<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.099> that<00:03:46.129> you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
you to adjust the curriculum so that you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.129 
you to adjust the curriculum so that you
can<00:03:46.549> build<00:03:46.760> your<00:03:47.030> strength<00:03:47.269> in<00:03:47.569> another<00:03:47.870> area

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
can build your strength in another area

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.140 
can build your strength in another area
if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:49.220> come<00:03:49.489> with<00:03:49.639> an<00:03:49.760> extraordinary

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
if you come with an extraordinary

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.390 
if you come with an extraordinary
background<00:03:51.019> in<00:03:51.139> statistics<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.129> really

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
background in statistics but you really

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.509 
background in statistics but you really
want<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.669> enhance<00:03:53.000> your<00:03:53.689> knowledge<00:03:53.900> of

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
want to enhance your knowledge of

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.729 
want to enhance your knowledge of
economics<00:03:55.519> will<00:03:55.970> work<00:03:56.269> with<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:56.840> short

economics will work with you in short

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.699 
economics will work with you in short
that<00:03:57.829> kind<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.729> very<00:03:59.030> customized<00:03:59.870> look<00:04:00.439> at

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
that kind of very customized look at

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.449 
that kind of very customized look at
your<00:04:01.040> background<00:04:01.639> and<00:04:02.769> curricular<00:04:03.769> planning

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
your background and curricular planning

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.909 
your background and curricular planning
is<00:04:04.729> precisely<00:04:05.359> what<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.109> department<00:04:06.290> does

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
is precisely what the department does

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.710 
is precisely what the department does
and<00:04:07.189> professor<00:04:07.609> Hogan<00:04:07.970> will<00:04:08.120> speak<00:04:08.509> in

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
and professor Hogan will speak in

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.409 
and professor Hogan will speak in
greater<00:04:09.049> detail<00:04:09.650> about<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.489> opportunity

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
greater detail about that opportunity

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.110 
greater detail about that opportunity
but<00:04:11.599> now<00:04:11.989> for<00:04:12.349> example<00:04:12.889> we<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:13.549> involved<00:04:14.030> in

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
but now for example we have involved in

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.710 
but now for example we have involved in
the<00:04:14.239> program

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the program

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
the program
a<00:04:14.780> student<00:04:15.380> who's<00:04:15.650> passed<00:04:15.920> two<00:04:16.160> examinations

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
a student who's passed two examinations

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.270 
a student who's passed two examinations
and<00:04:17.450> clearly<00:04:17.870> doesn't<00:04:18.290> need<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.010> kind<00:04:19.160> of

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
and clearly doesn't need the kind of

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.130 
and clearly doesn't need the kind of
introductory<00:04:19.760> working<00:04:20.299> probability<00:04:21.019> and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
introductory working probability and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.400 
introductory working probability and
statistics<00:04:21.829> that's<00:04:22.400> at<00:04:22.670> the<00:04:22.870> start<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
statistics that's at the start of the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.110 
statistics that's at the start of the
program<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.460> what<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:25.700> can<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.970> is

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
program and so what we can do is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.570 
program and so what we can do is
accelerate<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.990> student<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.770> give<00:04:28.160> him<00:04:28.400> the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
accelerate that student and give him the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.040 
accelerate that student and give him the
opportunity<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.420> do<00:04:29.540> much<00:04:29.810> more

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
opportunity to do much more

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.670 
opportunity to do much more
sophisticated<00:04:30.260> study<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:32.540> those<00:04:32.930> two<00:04:33.170> fields

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
sophisticated study in those two fields

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.990 
sophisticated study in those two fields
all<00:04:34.400> right<00:04:34.550> so<00:04:35.540> if<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.320> fact<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:37.010> bring<00:04:37.730> a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
all right so if in fact you bring a

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.320 
all right so if in fact you bring a
certain<00:04:38.270> richness<00:04:38.870> um<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.090> out<00:04:41.300> of

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
certain richness um that is out of

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.590
