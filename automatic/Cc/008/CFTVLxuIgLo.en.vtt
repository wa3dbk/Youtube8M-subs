00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.049
 find today for a new 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.270
 video routine this is the very first 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.550
 that I'm doing on my channel is about 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 routine that includes the days 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.639
 even if little boring where we do not know 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.980
 too much what to do the days anyway 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.839
 basically except that when I saw these 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.770
 videos I did not say it was not used 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.420
 not much 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 pass me concretely the real ones 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.439
 days in yes I was nothing you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 ensures that I do not pay anything so filmed it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 I did not see too much interest 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 I told myself that I was going to show you 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.460
 the little things I like to fear 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 that they expand that occupies me as I have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.809
 days where I have not much to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 do it even if sarah yeah but hey 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.960
 we arrive at all I show a little 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.420
 little do I do by going from the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 cooking with other beauty stuff that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 have nothing to do with beauty all the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 just stay here are the stuff that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
 relax and nice little activity or 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 the things we avoid doing in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 week but who is good to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 to recapture a little bit on the euro so 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.789
 I hope the video will please you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.329
 I spent a lot of time like you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.390
 in doubt 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.579
 but I hope it's worth it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.920
 anyway and then we start 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.480
 immediately before anything for this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.189
 kind of day we forget and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.710
 clothes a little bit sophisticated and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.060
 hello the super comfortable outfit where we 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 is comfortable in his sneakers 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.510
 so me it's super simple and after I 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.979
 flap my hair to be hyper 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.979
 quiet and the day to start 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.420
 the first activity is the most 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.530
 obvious if blum she left and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.820
 that's what I do most often 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.020
 when I said we welcome when I 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.760
 I want what is cooking 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.800
 to make good food so there by 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.020
 example that day I was preparing 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.440
 therefore Goosen maxims both cookies 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.790
 chocolates 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.500
 the recipe is not present thomas 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.360
 second string but I would have to 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.890
 make the choice age for pastry 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 but you can do just as well 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.480
 a prepared a small dish for the evening where 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.130
 here is a small dessert a small entrance 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.810
 a small dish no matter how varied 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.610
 and it is true that it allows to pass and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.380
 to tend to take care is pretty fun 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.000
 it's very nice and then it's 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.479
 always enjoyable to eat something 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.740
 that we made of ourselves because I 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.000
 started to get used to it's true 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.800
 that I appreciate a lot more when I have 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 prepared something and then that's it 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.190
 why hide it's still 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.540

 do not know I propose several recipes 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.030
 pretty greedy easy and fast to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.260

 of course the brushes wash one 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.300
 always keep a day or two in the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.590
 week does the characters tour 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.330
 if we can say 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 do it soon a video on the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 cleaning brushes with titles 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.060
 quality and little trick to do so here 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.060
 you want to know more stay connected 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.060
 we can in their lineage and also the 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.189
 doing the housework so there 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.079
 me for example it was my room 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.329
 baths especially my washbasin since by 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.280
 example to force washing and brushes 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.540
 and so on the immense immense to his 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.010
 protrusions easily remove I admit that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 is all white so it's going fast 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 and then I take the opportunity to do 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.439
 absolutely everything with macri michael and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.810
 I love it relaxes them so I'm doing it 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.879
 bathroom but I cook I do 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.530
 my room pygmy patou but that's it 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.480
 it's true that it's important to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.069
 end up in play written hyper maniac 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.689
 we also took the opportunity to make 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.760
 sorting in your things your wardrobe 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.409
 all this I did not film because 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.659
 I do that very rarely time so 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.060
 I sort very often in fact and 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.319
 after that I'm ordering myself so 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.449
 I did not arrange matters all the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.150
 time but here it can be also a 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.010
 day when you spend more time at 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.629
 sort through your business to do 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.669
 cleaning when you do not have time 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.439
 in fact you do it that day and 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.790
 of course it's super nice 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.620
 once it's over we appreciate 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.159
 still preserved when it smells good and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.810
 it's all cool for this part 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.060
 people who already have will understand 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.989
 quite generally I take advantage of 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.629
 days when I do not have much to do 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.040
 to be able to big cv there because I 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.389
 do not do often enough and it's 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.949
 something she likes a lot 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.879
 always head in time like that 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.290
 will understand 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.199
 you see how they came out 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.090
 she likes a lot but stays in place 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.250
 then we are reborn and that makes him 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.629
 a lot of well and thankfully 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.370
 that she does not have the pans according to I dare 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.680
 not even imagine the wager that this 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.509
 would be in any case me I show you 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.609
 Bella but it can be your dog or 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.989
 another pet just in 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.150
 take care and take care of him 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.189
 especially that day to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.530
 enjoy and then we will make it very 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.180
 well you will see a great classic 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.560
 when I have mature time I do not know 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.659
 not what to do is go on netflix 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.190
 and watch a crime so there for example 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.109
 leave confessions of an addict to 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.659
 shopping which is one of my movies 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.310
 favorite line finally short I think that 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.289
 I'm not the only one we are very 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 many large this case there with the 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.710
 adventures of crutches that are 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.440
 incredible so here and in passing 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.240
 miss my little my little cooking this 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.039
 that gb that was very very good good 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.490
 I like being able to keep a series or a 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.380
 pine 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.880
 it's just the perfect program for this 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.150
 kind of day then incidentally 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.770
 jury a little bit 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.900
 the wave people watch videos on 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.390
 youtube alone all that you imagine 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.730
 well something that I like a lot 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.530
 to do when it's sunny like here it's 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.330
 to take a bath and live like 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.330
 that on my terrace I'm really fucking 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.640
 well and I generally stay there a good 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.290
 little hour or so I just spend 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.570
 a few shops and I discuss I 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.460
 papote broadcast on green star but everything 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.880
 staying douar even cousin and his prices 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.680
 lose focus of course this moment he 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.510
 is to take care of yourself in 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.360
 using for example a scrub mask 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.460
 whether it's his face body care 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.290
 if you have the luck of belga 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.520
 so we knew how to sink haiti well 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.200
 nice 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.450
 I do not have any unfortunately 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.610
 it will be just unemployment and so on 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.250
 for example I took the opportunity to do 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.780
 a mask of the masked face russian duchy 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.880
 that I really like that I 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.740
 first done on my face and 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.420
 that I left to ask then I 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.030
 also benefited from this world in Cannes 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.650
 where the big thing to do for mid missed 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.530
 the rest of the body thing I do not do 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.450
 that very rarely is not perfect he 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.100
 must be said by laziness for lack of 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.990
 time we do not always want and this 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.300
 will be there then it's really the moment 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.770
 these opportunities I also benefit 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.390
 forced small retouches at the level 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.820
 eyebrows and so on 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.050
 by the way the video I use a mirror 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.030
 I found not very 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.950
 long time that is incredible container 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.970
 the wizards' creations actually there are 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.820
 sensors they turn on automatically 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.110
 when you approach the face it is 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.910
 very very big 6 years old and you see 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.400
 absolutely all the details fit together 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.320
 crazy you're interested I'll put the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.180
 link in tax bar and then after 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.550
 inevitably I rinse my mask and I 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.790
 let another pose a night mask 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.500
 who is this one from home loses 7 bis who 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.820
 is awesome and not that you leave asking 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.840
 all the life that serve as cream 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.840
 moisturizing also 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.189
 and finally for the last part I 'm 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.110
 put a little bit in the mood grout 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.460
 by lighting a candle enough 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.020
 refreshing that I like a lot of 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.509
