00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.020
 Of course, every perfect run fits 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.730
 an egg dish 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.680
 today markus become one in the middle 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.660
 make Italian herbal fairy theater 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.660
 to that we see in the bloody marys 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 for the flood victims we need so on 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.540
 saw cheese salt and pepper some milk 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.580
 I have a mixture of herbs here 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.520
 parsley chives thyme and 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.480
 Mint of some butter markus you can 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.640
 well beaten 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 Definitely super we need 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.780
 first six and in the meantime 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.910
 cut the herbs rightly that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.010
 the show made theater like me 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.989
 know only the classic misfortune ok well 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.000
 no italian herbs free theater 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.010
 is characterized by the fact that it is with 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.190
 parmesan cheese is made and also with 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.600
 cap and parsley 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.560
 Now I would be a bit milk in it 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.810
 just do a sip bit 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.880
 overlooked more 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 yes that's great and then back with 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 Season salt and pepper 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:28.450
 that's what it looks like a bit 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 parmesan cheese about 2 3 tablespoons that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.780
 right and now already one 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 whisk so nice and creamy 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 beat 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 so my herbs are more or now 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.270
 less sniping they come 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.780
 now in here we wanted yet 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.670
 a little bit more super the eggs 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.840
 are now well mixed up now 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.969
 we made the flag 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.740
 I always use butter for that 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.750
 could also take olive oil but that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.039
 has a slightly stronger taste and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.039
 butter just goes well with it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.410
 the butter is melted and the trap 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.170
 nice hot it 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.230
 the interference in the networking then 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.030
 the lid is opened and then 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.040
 we leave the whole thing on the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 hearts pasture long that has become firm 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 and then around the eggs 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.980
 Already the walls we do 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 after five minutes on the other side 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.120
 sg ready for theater 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.330
 markus maybe you can tell me that 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.280
 reach and now you have to 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:03.380
 just a little more skillful on the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.900
 We still have to do some dishes 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.700
 something nice to make it and you can 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.780
 ash on the table then it stands now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.100
 still the bloody mary or exactly 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.330
 Of course, I need it first of all 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.209
 tomato juice I miss that first 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.130
 a bit of grated horseradish 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.760
 horseradish yes that's really great 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.350
 Bonomy 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.860
 Tabasco sauce is okay too 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.860
 for a teaspoon 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.709
 and then had a lot of sauce, of course 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.430
 lemon juice pure half a lemon 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.659
 approximately 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.659
 and now properly pepper 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.829
 it is enough to go through it again 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.640
 and then very important to try 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.640
 for braking 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:19.160
 yes, but very well , but there is still missing 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:24.020
 what now or yes word yes again 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 get mixed up and that 's it 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.300
 actually already the fourth fix yes then 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.180
 comes in each glass slightly selle ring okay 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.180
 a knife the end just do it off
