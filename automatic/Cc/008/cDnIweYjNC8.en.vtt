once that world record bathroom is 203

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.410 
once that world record bathroom is 203
yeah<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.470> event<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.830> Phelps

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
yeah and this is one event that Phelps

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
yeah and this is one event that Phelps
yeah<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.380> ?<00:01:10.890> whether<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.520> he's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
yeah there's some ? whether or not he's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460 
yeah there's some ? whether or not he's
even<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> swim<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.690> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.870> he<00:01:13.200> will

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
even going to swim it I think he will

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.680 
even going to swim it I think he will
but<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.550> last<00:01:14.760> ones<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.330> think

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
but this is one of the last ones I think

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.810 
but this is one of the last ones I think
that<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> program<00:01:16.979> you've<00:01:17.640> got

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that would be on the program you've got

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
that would be on the program you've got
to<00:01:17.940> figure<00:01:18.120> he's<00:01:18.510> going<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.870> be<00:01:18.930> aware<00:01:19.200> he

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to figure he's going to be aware he

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
to figure he's going to be aware he
relays<00:01:19.770> you've<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.250> 100<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.760> 200<00:01:21.090> fly<00:01:21.210> that's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
relays you've got 100 and 200 fly that's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.800 
relays you've got 100 and 200 fly that's
a<00:01:21.600> live<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.229> 200<00:01:23.100> IM<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> 6<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
a live right there 200 IM is 6 so this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
a live right there 200 IM is 6 so this
