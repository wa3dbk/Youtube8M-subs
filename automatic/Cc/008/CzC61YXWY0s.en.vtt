this at 100 so what we've done is we're
calling<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.819> add<00:02:43.060> potion<00:02:43.540> effect<00:02:43.810> item<00:02:44.170> and

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
calling this add potion effect item and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.460 
calling this add potion effect item and
it<00:02:45.310> takes<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.819> potion<00:02:46.060> effect<00:02:46.690> which<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.349> we're

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it takes a potion effect which so we're

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.729 
it takes a potion effect which so we're
making<00:02:47.829> a<00:02:47.890> new<00:02:48.040> potion<00:02:48.459> effect<00:02:49.500> object<00:02:50.500> and

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
making a new potion effect object and

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.580 
making a new potion effect object and
that<00:02:50.769> takes<00:02:51.579> a<00:02:51.849> potion<00:02:52.269> effect<00:02:52.750> type<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.379> chose

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that takes a potion effect type we chose

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.339 
that takes a potion effect type we chose
night-vision<00:02:54.359> adoration<00:02:55.359> in<00:02:55.540> ticks<00:02:55.989> and

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
night-vision adoration in ticks and

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.130 
night-vision adoration in ticks and
remember<00:02:57.069> one<00:02:57.400> second<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.120> 20<00:02:58.510> ticks<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:58.989> this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
remember one second is 20 ticks so this

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.650 
remember one second is 20 ticks so this
is<00:02:59.260> five<00:02:59.470> seconds<00:02:59.890> and<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.459> amplifier<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.569> if

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
is five seconds and the amplifier so if

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.470 
is five seconds and the amplifier so if
you've<00:03:01.840> seen<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.379> you<00:03:02.530> know<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:03.480> like

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you've seen like you know like like

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.920 
you've seen like you know like like
regeneration<00:03:05.260> or<00:03:05.650> regeneration<00:03:06.160> -<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.030> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
regeneration or regeneration - and you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.349 
regeneration or regeneration - and you
know<00:03:08.049> that's<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:09.220> amplifier<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.359> is

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
know that's the amplifier so that is

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.379 
know that's the amplifier so that is
actually<00:03:14.049> all<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:14.769> need<00:03:14.919> to<00:03:15.099> do<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:16.120> add

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
actually all that we need to do to add

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.280 
actually all that we need to do to add
potion<00:03:17.290> effect<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.310> potion<00:03:19.030> item<00:03:19.419> so<00:03:20.109> we'll

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
potion effect and potion item so we'll

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
potion effect and potion item so we'll
go<00:03:20.410> ahead<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.010> export<00:03:21.760> our<00:03:22.470> kit<00:03:23.470> plug-in<00:03:24.250> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
go ahead and export our kit plug-in and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.129 
go ahead and export our kit plug-in and
then<00:03:25.750> we<00:03:26.169> shall<00:03:26.530> go<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.160> our<00:03:28.650> coding<00:03:29.650> tutorial

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
then we shall go to our coding tutorial

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:43.270 
then we shall go to our coding tutorial

today<00:03:57.880> bucket<00:03:58.880> has<00:03:59.420> not<00:03:59.810> yet<00:04:00.110> released<00:04:00.800> a

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
today bucket has not yet released a

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.410 
today bucket has not yet released a
version<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:02.209> uh<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:04.190> know<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.550> bucket<00:04:05.300> that

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
version of uh you know a bucket that

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.320 
version of uh you know a bucket that
supports<00:04:05.900> 1.5<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.250> for<00:04:07.580> now<00:04:07.730> you're<00:04:08.090> going<00:04:08.150> to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
supports 1.5 so for now you're going to

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.059 
supports 1.5 so for now you're going to
want<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.540> stay<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:09.040> 1.4<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.120> can<00:04:12.069> you

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
want to stay on 1.4 so that you can you

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.670 
want to stay on 1.4 so that you can you
so<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.700> test<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.540> go<00:04:15.080> on<00:04:15.200> other<00:04:15.350> servers

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
so you can test it go on other servers

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.640 
so you can test it go on other servers
and<00:04:15.980> also<00:04:16.430> test<00:04:16.700> your<00:04:16.820> plugins<00:04:17.329> once<00:04:17.959> 1.5

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and also test your plugins once 1.5

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.640 
and also test your plugins once 1.5
bucket<00:04:19.040> comes<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.640> will<00:04:20.230> you<00:04:21.230> know<00:04:21.320> start

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
bucket comes out I will you know start

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.080 
bucket comes out I will you know start
using<00:04:21.829> it<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.130> all<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.370> my<00:04:22.490> future<00:04:22.910> tutorials

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
using it in all of my future tutorials

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.920 
using it in all of my future tutorials
and<00:04:23.690> I'll<00:04:23.750> let<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.080> guys<00:04:24.200> know<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:26.330> let's<00:04:26.750> go

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and I'll let you guys know so let's go

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.260 
and I'll let you guys know so let's go
ahead<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.560> join<00:04:28.310> our<00:04:28.730> test<00:04:29.570> server<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:31.270> we'll

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
ahead and join our test server and we'll

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.010 
ahead and join our test server and we'll
give<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.900> try<00:04:33.260> alright<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:35.120> let's<00:04:35.750> go<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
give this a try alright so let's go and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.920 
give this a try alright so let's go and
use<00:04:36.169> our<00:04:36.320> kit<00:04:36.740> plugin<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.610> as<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.450> see<00:04:38.510> I

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
use our kit plugin and as you can see I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.170 
use our kit plugin and as you can see I
was<00:04:39.440> given<00:04:39.770> five<00:04:40.040> seconds<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.669> night<00:04:40.910> vision

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
was given five seconds of night vision

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.110 
was given five seconds of night vision
level<00:04:41.690> 2<00:04:41.960> which<00:04:42.680> has<00:04:42.889> now<00:04:43.040> worn<00:04:43.340> off<00:04:46.120> that's

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
level 2 which has now worn off that's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.240 
level 2 which has now worn off that's
odd<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.630> looks<00:04:47.660> like<00:04:47.900> we<00:04:48.020> set<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.410> amplifier

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
odd it looks like we set the amplifier

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.290 
odd it looks like we set the amplifier
to<00:04:49.280> 1<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.560> gave<00:04:51.800> us<00:04:51.830> two<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:52.910> wonder<00:04:53.180> what

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
to 1 but it gave us two I wonder what

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.390 
to 1 but it gave us two I wonder what
happens<00:04:53.630> if<00:04:53.720> we<00:04:53.930> set<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.290> to<00:04:54.320> 2<00:04:57.130> I'm<00:04:58.130> going<00:04:58.310> to

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
happens if we set it to 2 I'm going to

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.760 
happens if we set it to 2 I'm going to
give<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.729> a<00:04:58.760> try<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:02.050> it's<00:05:03.050> clear<00:05:03.650> the

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
give that a try and it's clear the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.430 
give that a try and it's clear the
inventory<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:06.880> then<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.060> gives<00:05:08.180> me<00:05:08.360> oh<00:05:08.539> yes

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
inventory and then that gives me oh yes

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.120 
inventory and then that gives me oh yes
of<00:05:09.770> course

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
of course

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.120 
of course
alright<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:11.390> probably<00:05:12.289> mentioned<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:12.979> before

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
alright I probably mentioned this before

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.100 
alright I probably mentioned this before
but<00:05:13.370> one<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.030> things<00:05:14.300> of<00:05:14.450> Java<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:14.930> you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
but one of the things of Java that you

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.490 
but one of the things of Java that you
have<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.530> know<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:15.979> that<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.789> starts<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:17.300> 0<00:05:17.500> so

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
have to know is that it starts with 0 so

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.200 
have to know is that it starts with 0 so
like<00:05:19.010> if<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.280> have<00:05:19.370> an<00:05:19.460> ArrayList<00:05:19.940> for

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
like if you have an ArrayList for

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.920 
like if you have an ArrayList for
example<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:21.200> first<00:05:21.500> entry<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.340> not<00:05:22.640> 1<00:05:23.030> it's<00:05:23.390> 0

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
example the first entry is not 1 it's 0

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.400 
example the first entry is not 1 it's 0
so<00:05:24.620> in<00:05:24.800> this<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.340> amplifier<00:05:26.080> when<00:05:27.080> when<00:05:27.380> I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
so in this the amplifier when when I

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.450 
so in this the amplifier when when I
give<00:05:27.979> it<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.250> amplifier<00:05:28.729> of<00:05:28.850> 0<00:05:29.530> then<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:31.160> will

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
give it the amplifier of 0 then it will

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.080 
give it the amplifier of 0 then it will
actually<00:05:32.210> if<00:05:32.390> I<00:05:32.539> reload<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:33.820> then<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:34.970> will

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
actually if I reload it then it will

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.210 
actually if I reload it then it will
actually<00:05:35.300> give<00:05:35.720> me<00:05:35.870> just<00:05:36.260> plain<00:05:36.530> night<00:05:36.800> vision

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
actually give me just plain night vision

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.100 
actually give me just plain night vision
so<00:05:37.729> that's<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.240> something<00:05:38.510> good<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.840> keep<00:05:38.930> in

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
so that's just something good to keep in

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.159 
so that's just something good to keep in
mind<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.500> also<00:05:40.039> I<00:05:40.250> was<00:05:40.880> given<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.570> potion<00:05:42.050> of

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
mind and also I was given a potion of

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.300 
mind and also I was given a potion of
night<00:05:42.380> vision<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.669> regular<00:05:44.120> 3<00:05:44.780> minute

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
night vision just a regular 3 minute

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.810 
night vision just a regular 3 minute
potion<00:05:46.310> I<00:05:46.490> think<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:46.940> can<00:05:47.120> also<00:05:48.610> yeah<00:05:49.610> I<00:05:49.640> think

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
potion I think you can also yeah I think

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.930 
potion I think you can also yeah I think
if<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.300> specify<00:05:51.169> an<00:05:52.060> amplifier

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
if you specify an amplifier

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.560 
if you specify an amplifier
in<00:05:54.050> there<00:05:55.080> let's<00:05:55.530> see<00:05:55.740> if<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:56.070> works<00:05:57.110> and

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
in there let's see if that works and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.630 
in there let's see if that works and
hits<00:06:01.160> then<00:06:02.160> now<00:06:02.790> that<00:06:02.820> didn't<00:06:03.270> work<00:06:04.110> but<00:06:04.640> right

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
hits then now that didn't work but right

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.080 
hits then now that didn't work but right
now<00:06:05.880> it's<00:06:06.300> some<00:06:06.780> giving<00:06:07.440> me<00:06:07.620> my<00:06:08.190> night<00:06:08.610> vision

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
now it's some giving me my night vision

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.140 
now it's some giving me my night vision
which<00:06:09.870> just<00:06:10.350> wore<00:06:10.800> off<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:12.530> now<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:14.070> also<00:06:14.400> gave

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
which just wore off and now it also gave

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150 
which just wore off and now it also gave
me<00:06:15.180> all<00:06:15.330> my<00:06:15.450> stuff<00:06:15.690> and<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:16.350> gave<00:06:16.500> me<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.740> potion

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
me all my stuff and it gave me a potion

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.070 
me all my stuff and it gave me a potion
of<00:06:17.460> night<00:06:17.700> vision<00:06:18.210> which<00:06:18.860> I<00:06:19.860> have<00:06:20.820> used<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.870> get

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
of night vision which I have used to get

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.590 
of night vision which I have used to get
fewer<00:06:22.320> some<00:06:22.590> night<00:06:22.740> vision<00:06:23.090> so<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.150> go<00:06:24.390> guys

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
fewer some night vision so you go guys

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.470 
fewer some night vision so you go guys
you<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:25.230> learned<00:06:25.500> about<00:06:25.850> potion<00:06:26.850> items<00:06:27.210> and

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
you just learned about potion items and

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.350 
you just learned about potion items and
