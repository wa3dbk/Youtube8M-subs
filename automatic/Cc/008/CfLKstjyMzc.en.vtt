00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.160
 what's up with people like zero tv sets 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.260
 this is done three times at twilight sloot 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.179
 on the ps4 xbox want 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.679
 there is no time just flowed 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 not commenting on the start today 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.460
 alone probably synonymous with the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 twelve extremists 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.539
 the high probably today I still out 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 I did not see the courage completely 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.760
 I am naturally curious, of course 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.170
 always kills therefore mask of the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.649
 Third man's not bad 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.230
 people and heart of practical fire 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.420
 Should one have fusion business 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 ammunition about the growing optimally 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.870
 people and of course his 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 health restored in one 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 Sphere picks up and increased melee 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.350
 attack tempo mask of the third volume 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 So you should have people and how 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.600
 I said I did not load that yet 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 seen before my ghost rausgeholt 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 very tense would have to ask the dead mb 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 be sawtooth oscillator is of the Dead 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.860
 orbit or I am still with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.869
 gravitational debian jagged through 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.759
 pvp and if I ever rocket launcher 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 then really use tomorrow's answer 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 but otherwise always mg you do a lot 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 more kills with tmg or rocket launcher 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 I would be burning interested in us 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.630
 clear pest control smart here 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 Tricks where the name is too long 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.470
 in my opinion is one how come 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 on such names and hard light 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 amon ladies if we have more of middle 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.600
 bring king of obsessed experience 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.670
 can 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.280
 how could some pick weapons 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 also play with these megaziles 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990
 This water ammunition on liquid 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.909
 Ammunition also scout the gun 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.710
 pretty cool out there a little bit more 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.930
 Gameplay already uploaded more 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.420
 Gameplay says my comments 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.860
 We upload that and I say 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.960
 That's it was good people 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.520
 Actually, one can say quite well 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 alone mask of the third man and heart 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.030
 the patient's fire was mega good me 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 do not even know if you still 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 gravitation theory 1 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 may somehow get over 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 I do not know the faction packages 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.820
 As I said today, what do you say ? 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.820
 I would be heavy mg or rocket launcher 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.670
 so of course pv plans so clear 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.770
 Most of the time everyone went to the pvp horn 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.680
 I think now only really heat 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.800
 or not but what's in the pvp what's up 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.270
 since mgv come more before starting rocket 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.070
 still sleepers in july and here i am 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.010
 sometimes it is very curious then so 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.640
 seen the third genus in heavy 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.320
 moni slot even correctly I am 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.140

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.360

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.580

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.810
 first gala for today the one right 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.580
 Blow sold in the Vancouver 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.710
 incredible moments but broken 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.110
 that's how people feel about it 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.810

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:16.230
