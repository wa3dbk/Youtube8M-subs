 of the concert of black belt drive mis 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.530

 the impression he gave me especially in the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.530
 beach was bad 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.100
 true when we went to the back

 from the room and did not want to leave anymore 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.360
 I started to suspect weird things by saying 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 this does not feel like a shit to touch today 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.410
 you do not go to a city with desire you go to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.000

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.340

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 I could record it because I said I have to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.610
 save to speak bryce truth me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.040
 you will see the truth if now 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 I regret myself but a concert of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.170
 truth the best thing is that seen everything is 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.020
 they sounded cool the singer's voice was 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.729
 hallucinatory 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 and that the micro was down but it 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.350
 I was listening was still having a lot 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.299
 merit is more after concerts 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.910
 They came to take pictures given away 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.410
 bracelets posters sold their albums to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.870
 five euros 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.710
 what else did they do and suddenly they leave 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.070
 raid that comes out as developed by 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.070
 chopin 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.290
 James who is the only one who can 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.270
 save from the concert because when driving 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.230
 true audio solution that gives show 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.390
 gave people touched their hands all 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.880
 true that I loved it and then the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 theme was andy andy was the biggest 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.450
 disappointment that we all take 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.680
 Sincerely Andean I sing almost sometimes 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.330
 is that the previous video surprised me 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.319
 because there was a lot of singing 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.390
 that only spoke in the parts that 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.250
 they sang or something like that because I really 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.680
 was there has not sung yes that is 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.810
 true that is heard low but pointed 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.340
 to people with the micro and the people 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.590
 he sang the songs the truth is that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.330
 for that, sincerely, I do want 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.850
 is I want to see how caldas live 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.010
 I want to feel everything I do not want to see how 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.500
 the pretty people afterwards told us 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.180
 well do not tell us I investigate a little 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.769
 because as you can see in twitter tions 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.120
 So pulling the faces out with more 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.010
 calm seeing it with perspective 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.769
 because musically speaking they went to 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.380
 final said be it I was a concert that 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.910
 I said god how good it sounds short service 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.230
 it was 50 minutes yes but you can not 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.030
 touch the same with the finished ones or 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.569
 we are finished our 50 you have 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.609
 to play at least 90 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.129
 later I was investigating so 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.879
 you see anise is a little pre because its 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.680
 girlfriend whatever it was until the 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.650
 hospital but honestly if I'm going to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.569
 make clear a whore fuck a whore 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.519
 shit for it entails being 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.139
 depressed and I was posing for a while and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.489
 it really is not something that we say all 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.370
 as we were talking about because do 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.489
 smile no we did not realize all 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.280
 I was posing and the one since each photo 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.739
 go out well see the photos and say what 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.269
 handsome left I do not really understand I do not know 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.799
 if he was under self-esteem sevilla 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.870
 He said it will come to that I am 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.250
 and could madryn the anime tell me what 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.699
 handsome and how handsome I am what good salgado 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.709
 In addition jake were then also is 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.209
 sick and with that is that they were more us 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.519
 try and more normal because it is that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.680
 was god he read the valid note and he was 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.239
 hyper bland hyper white without makeup and 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.630
 nothing because he is still the child extreme 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.449
 ring was the ying the others in some 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.610
 have 400 take advantage of a bit of decorum 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.510
 for example and left without combing it 's good 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.480
 because it looked like I was 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.280
 and it came out and what I touch everything and I do not let 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.290
 I have seen that there has been no play what 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.390
 had to touch the point that happens that the 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.550
 service the songs they brought 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.960
 to play here we all saw it and it was 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.509
 well I think that everyone came 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.940
 biosearch list and those who have touched 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.789
 half should touch and half brought 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.650
 15 songs play 7 and it's over there 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.080
 store the face of us being the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.940
 what an arrangement and that suddenly ends 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.940
 no doubt to finish 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.069
 and we were not what went wrong 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.830
 happened but people 15 minutes later 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.280
 to keep militating they have two left 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.280
 minutes 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.190
 came out the ying side 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.780
 I'm here us down and I'm 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.780
 waiting to leave 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.900
 I've heard because you have to value that 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.900
 You have gone 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.800
 after concerts and that's good now 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.420
 after having seen military and that 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.280
 said fuck 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.920
 I'm still closer but is that the 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.370
 difference in medieval class now not what 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.100
 I'm going to evaluate something that took 8 hours of 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.380
 queue 50 minutes of concert 26 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.760
 payments that I spend an entry and that I do not 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.100
 They have given what they had to to have 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.300
 come here to a city to our q le 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.190
 they have played because they had to play 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.660
 because they were enjoying I made themselves 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.100
 touched because I had to touch something what 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.930
 worse is that you see that the cni did not say 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.470
 nothing of madrid and then next day I 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.300
 does nothing 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.310
 it's your best are what has most 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.460
 enjoyed the fucking shit you put the 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.610
 fuck fucking madrid 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.360
 and tomorrow he passes from prison and after 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.360
 shit whores 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.430
 and the truth is that the people that I think 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.050
 She is very disappointed but if she wants to be 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.229
 play musically speaking outside 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.940
 and well, it does not surprise us that he says 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.130
 they used to tell me they have left 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.840
 weld that nothing is that they do not even say 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.360
 they said thank you there is a Spanish one 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.010
 once I heard I just wanted the 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.350
 angels leave English if principal 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.880
 pipe major and acting dark that 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.849
 true that it was a song 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.270
 very say 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.270
 but let's go 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.460
 the truth is that the calves 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.090
 they said that normally they did that 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.159
 it's nothing and they seem like a few are 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.080
 normal and the truth is that is not true 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.699
 the beams are normal that's 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.169
 asshole truth is that you do not know 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.879

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.900
 I have seen and realized I 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.050
 I hope it was a silly day and until 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.550
