00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.279
 to see Ivan is very easy to look at is only 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.170
 put your hands around here inside the 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.170
 console and pull up 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:24.880
 of jumping you are putting your hand like this 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 lateral and it's already raised you have 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.740
 all raised 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.349
 and those yellow wires of mine that are 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.349
 of the s of the start stop button 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.880
 and here you see the cable 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.829
 from that of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.890
 with its connector 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.180
 hooks up 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180
 there is no more is that 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.030
 then to place it 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.770
 you have to put it first in front of the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.920
 part of forward 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.050
 This area has about two pages 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 that sometimes when you take them out 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.750
 glances 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.630
 in the patina is 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.960
 those sideburns that you see there you have to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.420
 put them under all goals like this 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.110
 that is so cascading below look 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 he took it out 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.150
 something you see the pin out white back 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.280
 that it enters for upwards and then 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.690
 choose and come squeezing the console 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 backwards that is in front 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.280
 is already pressing the console here 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:39.070
 on the side and on the other side at the same time 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.070
 in spending everything so I can do it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 ah 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.180
 ah 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.520
 is placed again 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.880
 is this again in place without any 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880
 problem
