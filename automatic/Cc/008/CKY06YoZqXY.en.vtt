00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
obvious things three accelerator some

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
obvious things three accelerator some
people<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> big<00:01:01.559> fan<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
people like to but I'm a big fan of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
people like to but I'm a big fan of
three<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.340> mind<00:01:02.640> drawing<00:01:02.940> multiples<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
three I don't mind drawing multiples of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
three I don't mind drawing multiples of
these<00:01:03.600> card<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.769> makes<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.489> good

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
these card and what makes this that good

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
these card and what makes this that good
I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.330> because<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.380> arts<00:01:07.650> no

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I think is because you can use arts no

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.109 
I think is because you can use arts no
more<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.189> once<00:01:08.400> per<00:01:08.580> turn<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.909> that's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
more than once per turn like that's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.109 
more than once per turn like that's
literally<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.840> makes<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.290> good<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
literally what makes it that good and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
literally what makes it that good and
the<00:01:12.119> accelerators<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> arsenal<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> here

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
it does have that small effect of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460

joerger this card is nuts it's amazing
it<00:03:46.319> does<00:03:46.500> get<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> an<00:03:46.859> awkward<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.370> draw

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.190 
it does get to an awkward if you draw
and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> had<00:03:48.329> already<00:03:48.450> used<00:03:48.930> all<00:03:49.079> your

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
and then you had already used all your

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.750 
and then you had already used all your
targets<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.799> that's<00:03:49.980> why<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.489> run<00:03:50.730> that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
game so your to avoid things like just

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.300 
game so your to avoid things like just
set<00:03:59.250> traps<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:01.079> also<00:04:01.590> if<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:01.799> max<00:04:02.040> see<00:04:02.190> you

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
set traps and also if they max see you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.890 
set traps and also if they max see you
on<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.669> you<00:04:02.849> can<00:04:03.000> overlay<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.419> next<00:04:03.780> turn

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
on this you can overlay the next turn

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
on this you can overlay the next turn
and<00:04:04.109> they<00:04:04.200> won't<00:04:04.379> press<00:04:04.560> as<00:04:04.739> much<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:05.790> straps

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060

people<00:04:08.579> might<00:04:08.790> say<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.209> overkill<00:04:09.750> but

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
people might say this is overkill but

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.319 
people might say this is overkill but
this<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.109> exactly<00:04:10.290> what<00:04:10.889> works<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:12.060> need

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
this is exactly what works like you need

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.610 
this is exactly what works like you need
your<00:04:12.540> place<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.900> go<00:04:12.989> off<00:04:13.139> in<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:13.410> deck

your place to go off in this deck

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.259 
your place to go off in this deck
because<00:04:13.889> if<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.160> waste<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.579> combo<00:04:14.940> pieces

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
because if you waste your combo pieces

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.580 
because if you waste your combo pieces
and<00:04:15.449> they<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.660> something<00:04:15.870> like<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> trend<00:04:16.470> to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
and they have something like a trend to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.439 
and they have something like a trend to
a<00:04:16.620> mere<00:04:16.889> force<00:04:17.160> even<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.519> compulsive<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.299> right

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
a mere force even a compulsive the right

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.270 
a mere force even a compulsive the right
time<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.500> these<00:04:19.799> cards<00:04:20.039> are<00:04:20.190> very

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
time can here so these cards are very

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.469 
time can here so these cards are very
important<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> reason<00:04:21.180> why<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.359> don't

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
important and the reason why you don't

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.719 
important and the reason why you don't
max<00:04:21.780> out<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.229> run<00:04:22.380> one<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.650> these<00:04:22.770> if

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
max out just run one of these if

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.010 
max out just run one of these if
anything<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.090> would<00:04:24.180> max<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.690> servant

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
anything I would max on the servant

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.420 
anything I would max on the servant
tools<00:04:25.200> if<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.500> wanted<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.890> run<00:04:26.010> three<00:04:26.219> of<00:04:26.310> them

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
tools if you wanted to run three of them

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.590 
tools if you wanted to run three of them
but<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.180> balance

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
but I like the balance

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.000 
but I like the balance
between<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.080> because<00:04:28.350> trap<00:04:28.590> stun<00:04:28.800> takes

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
between this because trap stun takes

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.370 
between this because trap stun takes
care<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.340> multiple<00:04:29.600> set<00:04:30.600> traps<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.080> seven

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
care of multiple set traps but seven

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.620 
care of multiple set traps but seven
