for<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> flying<00:02:57.510> one<00:02:57.840> which<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.129> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
for the flying one which we are going to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.170 
for the flying one which we are going to
make<00:02:59.489> now<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> select<00:03:02.969> your

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
make now so now you have to select your

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.899 
make now so now you have to select your
mo<00:03:03.569> text<00:03:03.989> again<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.590> over<00:03:07.829> 60<00:03:08.760> or

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
mo text again and you go over 60 or

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.970 
mo text again and you go over 60 or
something<00:03:09.530> mark<00:03:11.180> +<00:03:12.180> add<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.719> keyframe<00:03:13.290> over

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
something mark + add the keyframe over

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.729 
something mark + add the keyframe over
here<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.969> we<00:03:15.359> are<00:03:15.420> going<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.629> go<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.810> 0<00:03:16.290> again

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
here and we are going to go to 0 again

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.920 
here and we are going to go to 0 again
and<00:03:18.650> here<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.829> are<00:03:19.889> going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.069> rotate<00:03:20.310> at<00:03:21.120> 360

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and here we are going to rotate at 360

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.360 
and here we are going to rotate at 360
degrees<00:03:22.019> okay<00:03:22.590> take<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.519> look<00:03:23.819> at<00:03:23.939> this<00:03:24.319> 360<00:03:25.370> did

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
degrees okay take a look at this 360 did

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.539 
degrees okay take a look at this 360 did
you<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.669> a<00:03:26.700> 360<00:03:27.389> degree<00:03:28.370> yeah<00:03:29.750> 360<00:03:30.889> yeah<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:32.129> get

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
you get a 360 degree yeah 360 yeah I get

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.209 
you get a 360 degree yeah 360 yeah I get
a<00:03:32.579> 360<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.359> here<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.720> now<00:03:34.290> let's<00:03:34.859> take<00:03:35.159> a

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:35.219 
a 360 over here and now let's take a

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.240 
a 360 over here and now let's take a
look<00:03:35.310> at<00:03:35.579> this<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:37.290> see<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.650> gets<00:03:37.889> back<00:03:38.219> to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
look at this you see it gets back to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.589 
look at this you see it gets back to
normal<00:03:39.769> okay<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:40.829> get<00:03:41.400> back<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.909> 0<00:03:42.209> 1<00:03:42.389> 0

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
normal okay but get back to the 0 1 0

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.369 
normal okay but get back to the 0 1 0
and<00:03:43.409> go<00:03:44.129> to<00:03:44.189> mow<00:03:44.519> text<00:03:44.969> actually<00:03:45.269> it's<00:03:46.260> not

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
and go to mow text actually it's not

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.140 
and go to mow text actually it's not
flying<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:46.950> we're<00:03:47.099> going<00:03:47.219> to<00:03:47.280> make<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.579> fly<00:03:47.819> so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
flying so we're going to make it fly so

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.229 
flying so we're going to make it fly so
select<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.510> vortex<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.469> back<00:03:49.500> to

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
select the vortex and we go back to

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.209 
select the vortex and we go back to
coordinates<00:03:51.239> right<00:03:51.599> over<00:03:51.870> here<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.290> make

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
coordinates right over here and make

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:00.439 
coordinates right over here and make
this<00:03:53.280> P<00:03:54.739> make<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.919> speed<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:57.229> TX<00:03:58.229> is<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.449> 500

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
this P make the speed to TX is it to 500

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.839 
this P make the speed to TX is it to 500
something<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.109> or<00:04:01.699> 550<00:04:03.440> 550<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.859> this

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
something like that or 550 550 and this

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.089 
something like that or 550 550 and this
pz<00:04:08.209> 2-2<00:04:09.209> thousand<00:04:09.780> words<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:10.859> going<00:04:11.040> to
