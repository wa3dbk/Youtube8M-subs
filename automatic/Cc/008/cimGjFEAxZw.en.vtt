as<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.429> can<00:01:57.459> see<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.789> have<00:01:58.090> double<00:01:58.450> springs<00:01:58.810> on

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
as you can see I have double springs on

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.719 
as you can see I have double springs on
that<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.739> just<00:01:59.920> kind<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.280> take<00:02:00.429> apart

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
that it's just kind of to take apart

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.449 
that it's just kind of to take apart
when<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.000> greasy<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.920> all<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.159> do<00:02:03.310> is

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
when it's greasy but all you do is

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.760 
when it's greasy but all you do is
insert<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.030> springs<00:02:04.479> into<00:02:04.840> each<00:02:04.989> other<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.560> it

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
insert the springs into each other so it

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.679 
insert the springs into each other so it
just<00:02:05.950> looks<00:02:06.130> like<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:06.520> side<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.390> fact<00:02:07.630> that

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
just looks like one side the fact that

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.970 
just looks like one side the fact that
you<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:07.959> tell<00:02:08.079> there's<00:02:08.259> two<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:10.980> then

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
you can tell there's two and on then

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.800 
you can tell there's two and on then
you're<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.549> want<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> make<00:02:13.150> sure<00:02:13.180> you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you're going to want to make sure you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.750 
you're going to want to make sure you
put<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.140> back<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:15.340> where<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.549> was<00:02:15.639> originally

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
put it back to where it was originally

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.699 
put it back to where it was originally
so<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:16.420> don't<00:02:16.600> put<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.019> left-hand<00:02:17.380> drive<00:02:17.590> when

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
so you don't put on left-hand drive when

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.170 
so you don't put on left-hand drive when
you<00:02:17.799> have<00:02:17.950> right-hand<00:02:18.400> drive<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:21.970> can

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
you have right-hand drive so see I can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.720 
you have right-hand drive so see I can

you<00:02:35.730> don't<00:02:35.820> want<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.240> double<00:02:37.080> springs<00:02:37.350> on

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
you don't want to have double springs on

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.850 
you don't want to have double springs on
just<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.130> Paul<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.380> retarded<00:02:40.740> I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
just one Paul and I'm kind of retarded I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
just one Paul and I'm kind of retarded I
kind<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.190> put<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.490> let's<00:02:41.910> bring<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.300> upside

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
kind of put it let's bring it upside

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.500 
kind of put it let's bring it upside
down<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.910> won't<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.090> work<00:02:45.180> either<00:02:47.510> so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
down that won't really work either so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.360 
down that won't really work either so
you<00:02:48.630> want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> look<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.860> without<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you want to look like that without the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.020 
you want to look like that without the
Paul<00:02:52.850> then<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.460> wanted<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.790> look<00:02:56.880> like

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
Paul then you just wanted to look like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.510 
Paul then you just wanted to look like
this<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.330> you're<00:02:57.480> done<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:59.130> makes<00:02:59.340> it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
this when you're done and it makes it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.960 
this when you're done and it makes it
kind<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.540> harder<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.930> push<00:03:01.110> down<00:03:01.520> overall<00:03:02.520> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
kind of harder to push down overall it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.970 
kind of harder to push down overall it
should<00:03:03.000> help<00:03:03.450> your<00:03:03.600> engagement<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.620> haven't

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
should help your engagement I haven't

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
should help your engagement I haven't
had<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.280> skipped<00:03:05.610> once<00:03:05.910> since<00:03:06.420> I've<00:03:06.540> had<00:03:06.660> this

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
had it skipped once since I've had this

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.480 
had it skipped once since I've had this
well<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.320> haven't<00:03:07.470> had<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.709> skip<00:03:07.890> anyways<00:03:08.250> but

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
well I haven't had to skip anyways but

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.400 
well I haven't had to skip anyways but
probably<00:03:09.330> has<00:03:09.450> less<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.930> chance<00:03:10.170> because

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
probably has less of a chance because

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.370 
probably has less of a chance because
