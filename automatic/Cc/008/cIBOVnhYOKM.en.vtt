00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.679
 Nikko Cordial Securities can be used 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.109
 And 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.039
 Correspondence team which does not make mistake of correspondence when we were born 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.289
 It is good 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.279
 I think together 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.990
 If it is true 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.770
 Master a clinic at Urasawa Hall 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 It will be automatic to protect if you receive 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.380
 I think it will be difficult in October with professional shooters 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.820
 Or do not think 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 Even though I did not cross the cleaning 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.490
 The person who makes 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 I think it is a way to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.230
 A boy who has been clarifying from the time when the fight money can be made 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 For example, on the last day of this test 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.080
 Because index finger 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 There are many new things that will lead to Oxford University in the UK 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.430
 I wonder if Ed is possessed 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 The Holy Optical Museum was big 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.250
 Here and there 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.540
 I got too strong with the mx series 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 When I put on this kind of laugh 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 Technical Committee will submit in February next year 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 It is a feeling like this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.020
 Ever get 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.510
 Up to one in this race 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.340
 et Robocon I would like to understand tobacco but countries 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.400
 Well 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 Cat language 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.900
 It is said that you get a return in the country but 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.890
 In the case of a person who is a little difficult 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 Etf much this index finger 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.299
 Hasegawa too 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.569
 I hope you're thinking about it 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:26.169
 If you experience the left thigh around normal mind and raise 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 If you are in the US 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.089
 I'm going to go up, but head 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.119
 Coach is white 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.119
 It is said that the burden is reduced 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.449
 It is that 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.639
 This was the lowest ever 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.629
 Aratsuki Flight 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.249
 this 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.109
 xe or something 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.029
 I will make Kobayashi in my body 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.539
 Netherlands of this month 9 This spreads to all prefectures and is 121 people of high 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.329
 Is it 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.870
 It is also true that there is 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.239
 You are doing this kind of way like this 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.500
 I still go to a convenience store I think 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.709
 Break 4 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.709
 Aiko part 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.539
 After all I went here 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.509
 Bubble How to avoid this 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:25.549
 It has been caught up with the precision farming school 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.989
 But it is strong 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.989
 Based on this information 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.209
 Isn't it a personal computer 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 In the screening situation 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.390
 I used a Danish or Sapphire substrate to hold the tip 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.759
 That's right but this is 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.709
 It can not be helped even if it is sold at high prices 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.849
 but 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.909
 If you can make English beans 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
 ecb specifies various ways of holding 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.479
 So 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.039
 Singing intensive burden too 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.899
 To manage 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.899
 There was it 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.630
 Everyone soon 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.720
 To be a way to avoid the impact of money that can be run 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.339
 It may have been white, but for example, for those who received intel 

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.329
 It may be difficult to become negative material for the time being 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.519
 but 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.519
 In terms of being better than Yamane can do 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.069
 I really recommend it 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.990
 The reason why you can do it is 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.240
 Because it is to talk in English 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.740
 Throw away threats without burdening your enka 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.330
 There will be no other after that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.050
 Yamane said only once in eight times that you said it would eventually drip 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.970
 Even if you know that Mita Gakuen Junior College has become 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.729
 It was because we were able to do enough 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.050
 If the light has passed 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.529
 Without memory 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.099
 Algorithmic degradation is to learn torn or torn 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.589
 If you think so, enter this time zone 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.589
 This is big 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.219
 Australian Open 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.939
 Really a break 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.789
 It is worthwhile 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.270
 Good but there were a total of 3 cases 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.930
 For those who are nostalgic 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 Something like English is strange 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.289
 Publish until then 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.379
 It is a thing 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.990
 that's all
