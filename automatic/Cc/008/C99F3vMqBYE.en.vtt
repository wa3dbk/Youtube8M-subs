there are two phases in milk texturing
first<00:03:16.620> we<00:03:16.860> stretch<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.520> milk<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> steam

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
first we stretch the milk with the steam

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600 
first we stretch the milk with the steam
to<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.050> required<00:03:19.440> thickness<00:03:19.740> for<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> type

in<00:05:43.190> thickness<00:05:43.640> now<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.990> thickness<00:05:45.440> depends

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
in thickness now the thickness depends

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.190 
in thickness now the thickness depends
on<00:05:46.010> how<00:05:46.220> much<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.580> stretch<00:05:46.850> the<00:05:47.090> milk<00:05:47.330> there

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
on how much you stretch the milk there

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.020 
on how much you stretch the milk there
is<00:05:48.350> more<00:05:48.500> stretching<00:05:48.890> for<00:05:49.220> a<00:05:49.250> cappuccino<00:05:49.550> than

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
is more stretching for a cappuccino than

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.960 
is more stretching for a cappuccino than

for a cafe latte this Guinness effect

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.060 
for a cafe latte this Guinness effect
goes<00:05:53.300> on<00:05:53.480> for<00:05:53.690> some<00:05:53.900> time<00:05:53.930> but<00:05:54.770> it<00:05:54.920> is

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
goes on for some time but it is

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.680 
goes on for some time but it is
important<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.640> understand<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.300> when<00:05:56.450> making

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
important to understand that when making

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.870 
important to understand that when making
cappuccinos<00:05:57.530> we<00:05:57.950> want<00:05:58.220> this<00:05:58.370> process<00:05:58.670> to

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
cappuccinos we want this process to

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.200 
cappuccinos we want this process to
occur<00:05:59.150> in<00:05:59.660> the<00:05:59.990> cup<00:06:00.200> so<00:06:01.040> when<00:06:01.730> we<00:06:01.880> finish

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
occur in the cup so when we finish

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.240 
occur in the cup so when we finish
steaming<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.900> milk<00:06:02.930> we<00:06:03.560> pour<00:06:03.830> our<00:06:04.010> milk

this<00:06:06.860> scenario<00:06:07.070> we<00:06:07.760> now<00:06:07.940> have<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.180> separation

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
this scenario we now have a separation

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.440 
this scenario we now have a separation
process<00:06:09.350> occurring<00:06:09.800> in<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.250> cup<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.700> in<00:06:11.330> the
