00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.160 

you<00:03:30.609> think<00:03:30.879> they'd<00:03:30.999> switch<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.540> up<00:03:31.599> a<00:03:31.780> bit<00:03:31.810> more

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
you think they'd switch it up a bit more

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.440 
you think they'd switch it up a bit more
step<00:03:32.769> letting<00:03:33.159> me<00:03:33.280> jump<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.030> same<00:03:34.239> place

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
step letting me jump in the same place

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.679 
step letting me jump in the same place
every<00:03:34.749> time<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:38.639> think<00:03:39.639> that's<00:03:39.849> how<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.060> can

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
every time I think that's how you can

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.520 
every time I think that's how you can
get<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.870> lot<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.079> points<00:03:41.560> anyway<00:03:41.969> if<00:03:42.969> you're

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
get a lot of points anyway if you're

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.259 
get a lot of points anyway if you're
going<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.829> high<00:03:44.980> score<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.819> keep<00:03:46.030> going

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
going for a high score just keep going

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.390 
going for a high score just keep going
to<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.450> same<00:03:46.629> place<00:03:46.689> seriously

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.899 

ok<00:03:55.000> running<00:03:55.329> out<00:03:55.569> of<00:03:55.599> time<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:55.959> need<00:03:56.909> two

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
ok running out of time here need two

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.330 
ok running out of time here need two
more<00:03:59.519> that's<00:04:00.519> good<00:04:00.730> enough<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:02.980> ended<00:04:03.220> up

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
more that's good enough so I ended up

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.110 
more that's good enough so I ended up
with<00:04:03.489> 25<00:04:04.030> oh<00:04:04.329> well<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.560> got<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.430> flour<00:04:06.819> jar

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
with 25 oh well I got the flour jar

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.409 
with 25 oh well I got the flour jar
that's<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.720> matters<00:04:14.730> what<00:04:15.730> else<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.120> we<00:04:16.239> get

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
that's what matters what else can we get

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.200 
that's what matters what else can we get
in<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:19.979> think<00:04:20.979> there's<00:04:21.160> another<00:04:21.430> flower<00:04:21.910> in

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
in I think there's another flower in

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.730 
in I think there's another flower in
here<00:04:22.389> I'm<00:04:22.630> not<00:04:22.750> sure<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:28.260> wouldn't<00:04:29.260> advise

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
here I'm not sure that I wouldn't advise

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.189 
here I'm not sure that I wouldn't advise
doing<00:04:30.310> why<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.639> just<00:04:30.910> did<00:04:31.090> there<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.990> getting

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
doing why I just did there and getting

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:44.600 
doing why I just did there and getting
into<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.590> battle

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.570 

okay<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.360> parts<00:04:45.750> really<00:04:46.430> tricky<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.550> a

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
okay this parts really tricky on a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.860 
okay this parts really tricky on a
keyboard<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:49.669> it's<00:04:50.669> only<00:04:50.819> 20<00:04:51.150> coins<00:04:51.330> anyway

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
keyboard and it's only 20 coins anyway

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.270 
keyboard and it's only 20 coins anyway
probably<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:52.889> worth<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:56.719> here<00:04:57.719> we<00:04:57.840> are

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
probably not worth it and here we are

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.950 
probably not worth it and here we are
there's<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.370> little<00:04:59.669> hidden<00:05:00.030> chest<00:05:00.419> back<00:05:00.689> here

good enough to do this without the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.140 
good enough to do this without the
practice<00:05:37.439> um<00:05:39.800> my<00:05:40.800> cats<00:05:41.129> kind<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.639> sitting<00:05:41.849> over

it<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.330> need<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.319> practice<00:05:48.259> okay<00:05:49.259> well<00:05:49.440> I<00:05:49.469> know

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
it I need the practice okay well I know

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.180 
it I need the practice okay well I know
the<00:05:49.830> how<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.490> do<00:05:50.759> it<00:05:51.319> you<00:05:52.319> get<00:05:52.469> three<00:05:52.770> cookies

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
the how to do it you get three cookies

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.279 
the how to do it you get three cookies
so<00:05:53.400> you<00:05:53.490> can<00:05:53.610> kind<00:05:53.879> of<00:05:53.969> suck<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.960> get<00:05:55.139> away

with<00:05:55.409> it<00:05:55.589> I<00:05:56.330> just<00:05:57.330> need<00:05:57.479> to<00:05:57.539> practice<00:05:57.810> on<00:05:58.169> the

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
with it I just need to practice on the

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.950 
with it I just need to practice on the
timing<00:05:58.529> because<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:59.339> know<00:06:00.180> I'm<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.629> to<00:06:00.690> screw

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
timing because I know I'm going to screw

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:11.820 
timing because I know I'm going to screw
that<00:06:01.139> up

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.430 

ok<00:06:12.830> so<00:06:12.890> I'm<00:06:13.100> not<00:06:13.250> so<00:06:13.430> bad<00:06:13.640> at<00:06:13.790> that<00:06:13.970> but<00:06:14.440> the

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
ok so I'm not so bad at that but the

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.040 
ok so I'm not so bad at that but the
question<00:06:15.950> is<00:06:16.100> can<00:06:16.370> I<00:06:16.520> do<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.880> without<00:06:17.030> those<00:06:17.330> 12

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
question is can I do it without those 12

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.890 
question is can I do it without those 12
things<00:06:18.470> popping<00:06:19.070> up<00:06:22.060> I'll<00:06:23.060> probably<00:06:23.420> end<00:06:23.750> up

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
things popping up I'll probably end up

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:34.090 
things popping up I'll probably end up
using<00:06:24.080> all<00:06:24.350> three<00:06:24.500> cookies<00:06:32.500> come<00:06:33.500> on<00:06:33.620> man<00:06:33.830> run

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
using all three cookies come on man run

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
faster okay now I lost the rhythm or

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.240 
faster okay now I lost the rhythm or
something<00:06:41.330> I<00:06:41.540> have<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.620> use<00:06:42.770> all<00:06:43.040> three

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
something I have to use all three

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.050 
something I have to use all three
cookies<00:06:43.640> now<00:06:45.160> there<00:06:46.160> we<00:06:46.370> go<00:06:48.820> so<00:06:49.820> with<00:06:49.970> a<00:06:50.000> little

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
cookies now there we go so with a little

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.580 
cookies now there we go so with a little
bit<00:06:50.330> of<00:06:50.420> cheating<00:06:50.960> I<00:06:51.170> was<00:06:51.800> able<00:06:51.920> to<00:06:52.160> get<00:06:52.280> it<00:06:53.590> now

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
bit of cheating I was able to get it now
