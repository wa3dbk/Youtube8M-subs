United States as I map for GTA 6

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.740 
United States as I map for GTA 6
apparently<00:00:52.620> according<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.430> article

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
apparently according to this article

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
apparently according to this article
personally<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> bit

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
personally I think this is a bit

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
personally I think this is a bit
overkill<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.760> true<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
overkill I don't think it's true but is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
overkill I don't think it's true but is
a<00:00:57.390> cool<00:00:57.719> concept<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.559> goes<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> say<00:00:59.280> here

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
a cool concept it goes on to say here

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
a cool concept it goes on to say here
the<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.789> shifted<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.480> release<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.020> 2020

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the game is shifted for release in 2020

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
the game is shifted for release in 2020
so<00:01:02.129> there's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> possible<00:01:02.760> release<00:01:03.030> day<00:01:03.270> 2020

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
so there's a possible release day 2020

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.140 
so there's a possible release day 2020

more stuff I just wanted to read you
this<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.770> interesting

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this as I think it's more interesting

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.429 
this as I think it's more interesting
the<00:01:17.670> next<00:01:17.909> GTA<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.450> take<00:01:18.659> around<00:01:18.780> five<00:01:19.170> years

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the next GTA will take around five years

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
the next GTA will take around five years
for<00:01:19.590> completion<00:01:20.130> hence<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> 2020<00:01:21.270> release

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
for completion hence the 2020 release

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
for completion hence the 2020 release
date<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.500> size<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> game<00:01:23.100> will<00:01:23.250> be

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
date and the size of the game will be

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.990 
date and the size of the game will be
that<00:01:23.549> twice<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.450> GTA<00:01:25.290> 5<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.740> obviously<00:01:26.070> GTA<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that twice of GTA 5 so obviously GTA is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
that twice of GTA 5 so obviously GTA is
huge<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> water<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
huge with all the water just think of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.440 
huge with all the water just think of
