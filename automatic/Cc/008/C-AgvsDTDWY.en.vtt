here<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.830> clean<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.840> here<00:01:41.709> is<00:01:41.920> with<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.310> body

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
here is clean and here is with the body

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:59.200 
here is clean and here is with the body
switch<00:01:42.759> in<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.330> up<00:01:43.569> position

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.170 

and<00:01:59.810> now<00:02:00.470> let's<00:02:00.890> put<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.730> down

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
and now let's put it in the down

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:11.550 
and now let's put it in the down
position

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.440 

you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.119 

so<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.930> therefore<00:02:22.230> kind<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.500> matching

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
so that is therefore kind of matching

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.970 
so that is therefore kind of matching
the<00:02:23.940> overdrive<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> kind<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.680> pickups

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the overdrive to the kind of pickups

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.649 
the overdrive to the kind of pickups
whether<00:02:26.190> using<00:02:26.370> single<00:02:26.790> coils<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.209> humbuckers

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
whether using single coils or humbuckers

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.500

position I want to show you some of the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.990 
position I want to show you some of the
range<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.299> gain<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.680> before<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.099> do<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.610> want

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
range of the gain but before I do I want

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.509 
range of the gain but before I do I want
to<00:02:36.060> back<00:02:36.269> off<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.230> drive<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.860> little<00:02:38.400> bit

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
to back off on the drive a little bit

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.470 
to back off on the drive a little bit
and<00:02:38.700> increase<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.530> level<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.159> gain<00:02:41.909> sorry<00:02:42.269> and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.080 

you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.640 

so<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.360> can<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.599> back<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:17.200> your<00:03:17.379> volume

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
so you can just back off on your volume

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.869 
so you can just back off on your volume
just<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.920> little<00:03:18.129> bit<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.520> cleans<00:03:18.700> up

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
just a little bit there and it cleans up

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:30.240 
just a little bit there and it cleans up
so<00:03:19.090> here's<00:03:19.269> full

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.640 

now<00:03:30.790> we'll<00:03:30.970> back<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.180> off<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.260> volume<00:03:32.440> on

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
now we'll back it off on the volume on

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:44.910 
now we'll back it off on the volume on
my<00:03:32.770> guitar<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.130> accorded<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.580> way

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.670 

now<00:03:45.920> let's<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:46.489> into<00:03:46.760> some<00:03:47.110> higher<00:03:48.110> gain

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
now let's go into some higher gain

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.479 
now let's go into some higher gain
territory<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.980> will<00:03:53.080> let<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.110> hear<00:03:54.560> some<00:03:55.159> more

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
territory we will let you hear some more

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:30.749 
territory we will let you hear some more
of<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.700> range

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:05:34.780 

now<00:04:31.759> let's<00:04:32.209> crank<00:04:32.599> it<00:04:32.719> even<00:04:33.259> more

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.600 

so<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:36.000> pretty<00:05:36.330> cool<00:05:36.810> screaming<00:05:37.800> overdrive

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
so a pretty cool screaming overdrive
