called the pullover now the pullover is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.259 
called the pullover now the pullover is
very<00:00:22.830> simple<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.310> simply<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.640> taking<00:00:23.970> some

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
very simple it's simply just taking some

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.609 
very simple it's simply just taking some
of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> chips<00:00:24.630> putting<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.350> side

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
of the chips putting them to the side

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
of the chips putting them to the side
and<00:00:25.890> then<00:00:26.369> lifting<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> rest<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> putting

and then lifting up the rest and putting

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
and then lifting up the rest and putting
on<00:00:27.539> back<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.900> top<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.710> cutting<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> deck<00:00:29.250> so

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
on back on top like cutting the deck so

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.160 
on back on top like cutting the deck so
it<00:00:30.119> doesn't<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.449> matter<00:00:30.630> how<00:00:30.840> many<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it doesn't really matter how many you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.540 
it doesn't really matter how many you
take<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.769> case<00:00:31.980> we're<00:00:32.160> shooting<00:00:32.399> for

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
take in this case we're shooting for

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
take in this case we're shooting for
half<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.969> having<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.600> different<00:00:33.840> colors

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
half and having the two different colors

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
half and having the two different colors
helps<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.469> determine<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.790> pull<00:00:35.969> them

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
helps you determine that so pull them

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.250 
helps you determine that so pull them
over<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.510> thumb<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.719> middle<00:00:37.110> finger

your other two you're weaker fingers we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.319 
your other two you're weaker fingers we
call<00:00:41.070> them<00:00:41.190> pick<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.090> back<00:00:42.270> on

call them pick them up and put back on
top<00:00:42.660> you're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> alternate<00:00:43.829> between

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
top you're going to alternate between

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.290 
top you're going to alternate between
fingers<00:00:44.430> start<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:46.010> and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
fingers start with the first three and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
fingers start with the first three and

fingers that are free or just going to
trap<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.000> chips<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.510> anywhere<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
trap the chips from go anywhere so this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.270 
trap the chips from go anywhere so this
can<00:01:13.229> move<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.619> solid<00:01:13.799> block<00:01:16.159> you're<00:01:17.159> going

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
can move as one solid block you're going

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.710 
can move as one solid block you're going
to<00:01:17.340> apply<00:01:17.460> pressure<00:01:17.790> together<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.540> your

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
fingers are going to kind of go like

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
fingers are going to kind of go like
this<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.299> feel<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.960> to

have to develop but all the fingers kind

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630 
have to develop but all the fingers kind
of<00:01:23.850> slightly<00:01:24.119> squeeze<00:01:24.509> together<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.549> at<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of slightly squeeze together and at the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
of slightly squeeze together and at the
same<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.659> stack<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
same time this back stack right here is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
same time this back stack right here is
lifted<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.340> angle<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.729> slight<00:01:30.119> tilt<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
lifted up on an angle a slight tilt a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.010 
lifted up on an angle a slight tilt a
very<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.409> slight<00:01:31.680> tilt<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.720> could<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
very very slight tilt you could do that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
very very slight tilt you could do that
with<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.290> ring<00:01:34.950> finger<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.430> thumb

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
with your ring finger and your thumb

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
with your ring finger and your thumb
just<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.030> slight<00:01:36.299> tilt<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.829> push<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
just a slight tilt as you push all the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.719 
just a slight tilt as you push all the
chips<00:01:38.720> together<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.619> squeeze<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.610> do

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
chips together you squeeze and you do

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.179 
chips together you squeeze and you do
the<00:01:41.820> tilt<00:01:42.170> they<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.470> rise<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.979> start

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the tilt they go all rise up and start

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.980 
the tilt they go all rise up and start
to<00:01:44.280> interweave<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> interweave<00:01:45.720> all

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to interweave and as the interweave all

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.130 
to interweave and as the interweave all
fingers<00:01:46.799> leave<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> table<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> rise<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.899> into

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
fingers leave the table and rise up into

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.340 
fingers leave the table and rise up into
the<00:01:49.259> air<00:01:50.210> doing<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> very<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.869> slowly<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the air doing this very very slowly so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
the air doing this very very slowly so
you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.530> try<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> visualize<00:01:53.490> what's<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.790> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you can try to visualize what's going on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
you can try to visualize what's going on
all<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.320> fingers<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> squeeze

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
all the fingers are going to squeeze

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.630 
all the fingers are going to squeeze
together<00:01:56.570> you're<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> tilt<00:01:58.640> with

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
together you're going to do a tilt with

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.450 
together you're going to do a tilt with
the<00:01:59.729> back<00:01:59.909> fingers<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the back fingers and then all the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.649 
the back fingers and then all the
fingers<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.149> had<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> very<00:02:03.479> large

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
fingers go up if I had a very large

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
fingers go up if I had a very large
stack<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.290> would<00:02:04.439> look<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.710 

I'll<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.759> very<00:02:08.850> slow<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.600> I'm

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I'll do this very slow so you see I'm

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.060 
I'll do this very slow so you see I'm
squeezing<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.410> fingers<00:02:10.650> together<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
squeezing all my fingers together the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.950 
squeezing all my fingers together the
back<00:02:11.250> ones<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.490> crap<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.690> front

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
back ones are crap like this the front

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.580 
back ones are crap like this the front
two<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.230> blocked<00:02:13.530> off<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> slight<00:02:15.030> tilt

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
two are blocked off you do a slight tilt

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
two are blocked off you do a slight tilt
chip<00:02:16.590> start<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> intermix<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.000> lift<00:02:18.180> your

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
chip start to intermix and you lift your

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.100 
chip start to intermix and you lift your
fingers<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:20.550> full<00:02:20.820> speed<00:02:23.840> give<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> book

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
fingers up if full speed give a book

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:35.380 
fingers up if full speed give a book
like<00:02:25.290> this

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.880 

one<00:02:36.390> final<00:02:36.720> tip<00:02:36.840> about<00:02:37.080> chip<00:02:37.320> shuffling<00:02:37.740> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
one final tip about chip shuffling I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.560 
one final tip about chip shuffling I
would<00:02:38.310> recommend<00:02:38.700> starting<00:02:38.730> off<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.420> first

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
would recommend starting off your first

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.390 
would recommend starting off your first
time<00:02:39.840> with<00:02:39.960> about<00:02:40.170> six<00:02:40.470> chips<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> adding

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
time with about six chips and adding

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.150 
time with about six chips and adding
chips<00:02:41.610> as<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.850> get<00:02:42.000> better
