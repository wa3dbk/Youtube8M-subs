but<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:04.060> off<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.299> spec<00:04:04.510> sheet<00:04:04.780> which<00:04:05.340> you

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
but just off the spec sheet which you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.680 
but just off the spec sheet which you
can<00:04:06.610> really<00:04:06.790> take<00:04:07.000> for<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.209> grain<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.420> salt<00:04:07.569> I

can really take for a grain of salt I

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.660 
can really take for a grain of salt I
guess<00:04:07.870> until<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.200> see<00:04:08.319> 101<00:04:08.769> horsepower<00:04:09.130> from
