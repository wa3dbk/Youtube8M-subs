00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.969 
want now not every app will work some
apps<00:04:37.639> just<00:04:37.850> really<00:04:38.510> don't<00:04:39.139> have<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.410> tablet<00:04:39.680> UI

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
apps just really don't have a tablet UI

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.950 
apps just really don't have a tablet UI
mode<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.639> some<00:04:40.820> apps<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.389> said<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.720> hable

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
mode like some apps you said it's hable

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.750 
mode like some apps you said it's hable
UI<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.800> just<00:04:42.919> makes<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.190> bigger<00:04:43.370> that's

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
UI and it just makes it bigger that's

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.570 
UI and it just makes it bigger that's
all<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.540> think<00:04:45.410> really<00:04:45.919> for<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.280> google

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
all so I think really for the google

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.700 
all so I think really for the google
apps<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:47.030> works<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.360> best<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.840> lastly<00:04:48.440> let<00:04:48.650> me

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
apps it works the best and lastly let me

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
convenient to switch to rather than

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.840 
convenient to switch to rather than
