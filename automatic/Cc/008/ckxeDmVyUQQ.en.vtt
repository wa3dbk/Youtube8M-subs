00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.680
 communication arkady gift leading organizer 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.080
 events summer heat and we continue 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.380
 A series of useful videos for our young 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.670
 on organizing and holding weddings and 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.539
 this short video would like to tell 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.260
 about the five benefits of traveling 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:36.850
 ceremony on the car if only hello 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.080
 dog so the first and most 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 the main thing is that you can 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.790
 feel like hollywood 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.809
 heroes of the Hollywood picture 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.239
 You must have seen films and where 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 beautiful lawn green grass in 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.290
 identical bridesmaid dresses 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 beautiful dressed chairs are required 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.160
 bows dressed up nicely guests and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.910
 of course kids and no serious little 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.000
 in strict suits and no parting words 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.920
 from the deputies of the city council second 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.729
 an advantage that I would like for you 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.299
 to tell 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.369
 exit marriage registration is what 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.440
 place you can choose absolutely any 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.290
 it can be a city park it can 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.530
 be the beach it could be the high-rise roof 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.700
 buildings this may be a library or 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.400
 even own kitchen 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.799
 if you have always dreamed about it all the more 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.049
 what is a photo shoot done in that place 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.600
 which one you choose will be stylistically 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.939
 nice to your look 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.159
 the third advantage is the time and date you 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.280
 also choose yourself not to adapt 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 under the schedule of work and the time of the registry offices 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.299
 and not adapting to their workload 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.630
 the fourth advantage is that instead 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.420
 dry phrases I agree or I agree you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 can hear 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.509
 each other's sentimental vows 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 surrounded by crying in part and joy for 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.950
 your guests and finally the fifth 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.519
 advantage of exit marriage registration 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.019
 this is something you can invite to 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.530
 ceremony of all guests 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.310
 You want to see 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 the number of most of the registry limits 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.250
 number of guests 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.010
 so not all guests can 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.900
 attend your ceremony and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.599

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 tormenting whom strike out his girlfriend 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.500

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.579

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.579
