know<00:00:51.170> basically<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.379> mean<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
know basically i mean it's not really a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
know basically i mean it's not really a
series<00:00:53.550> i<00:00:53.789> mean<00:00:54.420> i<00:00:54.510> guess<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:54.989> say<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
series i mean i guess you could say as a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
series i mean i guess you could say as a
series<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.120> all

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
series but it's not like I get them all

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
series but it's not like I get them all
the<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.780> i<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.859> always<00:00:59.070> join

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the time because i don't always join

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.279 
the time because i don't always join
matches<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> puts<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> 0<00:01:00.809> &amp;<00:01:01.020> 3

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
matches and it puts me when it's 0 &amp; 3

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.070 
matches and it puts me when it's 0 &amp; 3
and<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.940> chance<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> come<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.840> you
