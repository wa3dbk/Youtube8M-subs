00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.730 
that's probably what's gonna happen
anyways<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:30.170> thought<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:31.290> gonna<00:03:31.440> leave

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.690 
anyways so I thought it's gonna leave
you<00:03:31.950> down<00:03:32.190> there

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
and so I've washed out the competition

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.340 
and so I've washed out the competition
so<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.240> guaranteed<00:03:37.140> win

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.820
