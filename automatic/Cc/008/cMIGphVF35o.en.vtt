00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.280
 the people of youtube welcome to this 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.769
 new a boxing of the styles series h 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.839
 wireless 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.150
 these wonders came to me the day of 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.859
 yesterday so let's do a boxing 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.509
 notice that the review will do it in the 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.610
 next week explaining everything well what 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.119
 that has how the quality of the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.439
 same 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.060
 etcetera but for now I'm not going to 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.310
 do anything I want to try it first before 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.899
 to talk about the headset what we can 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.239
 notice at a glance is that the box very 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.430
 very large since also the headset 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.719
 it's pretty big in terms of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.450
 pads 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.480
 with texture and others and besides being in 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.670
 many accessories are obviously for the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.800
 operation of the headset is 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.420
 cross-platform that's going to explain it 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.700
 then in the review now only what 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.739
 let's open when we take out the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.110
 Main carton we noticed this beautiful 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.329
 coffee steelseries in a pretty box 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.690
 pretty which contains our 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.690
 headphones 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.260
 as you can see, the box has a texture 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.300
 really pretty 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.130
 the box is made of a very cardboard 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.400
 resistant so you do not have problems 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.870
 when they are bringing to fall is not going to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.910
 spend anything that is totally 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.300
 quiet is very very tough this 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.690
 box 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.750
 we open the box our headphones 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.970
 Hermes looks 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.790
 then steelseries about 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.400
 the headband 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 here we can also appreciate the console 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.130
 Sound 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 then let's show it well and do 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.689
 an aerial shot we raise the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 headphones and tells us that they are very 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 heavy very sturdy I guess they are not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.100
 recommended for people who use 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.909
 lenses but for people who do not use goes 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 to come pretty well 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.310
 I love them and they are very wide very thick and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 here we can observe the microphone 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.179
 retractable something that has us 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.850
 used without series the only thing that 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.880
 he has a law when he is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.189
 deactivated investigating more helmets 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.830
 of headset I found a couple of little things 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.660
 including two buttons that serve to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 the same thing as if we keep 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.760
 tight one turns off the headset and if 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.610
 we squeeze it just fine the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.290
 microphone after here we have two 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.819
 tickets that is one for entry of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.879
 cellular and another for optical inputs 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.129
 and these are properly the headphones 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.659
 then they have a wheel one more scroll 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.890
 above that can not be appreciated with the 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.200
 camera that is to regulate the sound 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.350
 Now let's remove it with solitaire 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.010
 the most interesting thing about this headset already 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.020
 which has many characteristics for 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.060
 modify it to connect it is more we see 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.660
 the inputs the battery charger 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.150
 the volume and more 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 I'm difficult and to put the battery and 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.390
 it is automatically loaded and good 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.020
 entries that we are going to review in the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.080
 review 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.580
 and we remove the plastic from the headphones 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.230
 to find this black box 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.230
 mysterious let's see what it contains 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.560
 we add our magic knife to 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.040
 take out the tapes is all very well 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 protected 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.890
 and we manage to open it in the first thing 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.890
 that we see is a textile sticker series 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.610
 and obviously the manuals the manual 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.500
 true that he did a lot is a headset 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.020
 difficult to install and difficult to put 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.970
 so the manuals in these types of 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.900
 headphones 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.900
 of much help 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.480
 let's see a quick view of all the 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:49.019
 pages for instructions for xbox 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.829
 playstation television pc mac and 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.829
 cell phones 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.380
 then we have the sticker of this 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.380
 interest that never fails 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.299
 but we find the great 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.420
 variety of cables that brings us the h 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.849
 wireless 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.650
 optical cables cellular cables 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:18.919
 cables for xbox chat analog cables 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.150
 USB plug-and-play cables and good for 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.010
 who will wonder what so many 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.710
 which is a wireless headset is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.200
 because to connect the console we have 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.500
 all this variety of cables we do not have 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.730
 in his room two with one or two enough 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.290
 but it is so that we can inform 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.300
 we want is not that we have 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.800
 plug in the 20 cables 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.690
 then another thing that is much appreciated 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.139
 are the adapters for the different 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.210
 countries and regions like in the USA have 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.550
 other legs, so to speak 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.400
 adapters I bring one American 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.169
 Latin American European and so on and the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.419
 true that it serves a lot 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.680
 although to connect it to the pc is enough 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.680
 with a usb cable 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.930
 another thing that our baby gives is a 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.599
 extra battery since one comes inside 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.580
 of the headset itself this is so that 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.139
 while we charge a battery, let's use the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.809
 another if we never run out of 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.389
 Earphone after hours of unpacking 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:20.839
 the box is empty and this is all that 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.159
 brings us the professional headset on 15 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.229
 10 h wireless 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.360
 thank you very much for watching this a boxing 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.150
 remember to subscribe late like 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.080
 share it I hope you in the review we 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.080
 we see chau chau
