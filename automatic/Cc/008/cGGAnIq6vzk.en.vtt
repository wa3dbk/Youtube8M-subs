I<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:20.350> became<00:00:20.530> interested<00:00:20.920> in

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
I first became interested in

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
I first became interested in
alternative<00:00:23.490> energy<00:00:23.610> back<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.590> 1970s

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
alternative energy back in the 1970s

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.260 
alternative energy back in the 1970s
when<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> United<00:00:26.430> States<00:00:26.460> went<00:00:26.850> under<00:00:27.119> its

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
when the United States went under its

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.530 
when the United States went under its
first<00:00:27.540> oil<00:00:27.990> embargo<00:00:28.710> at<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> lived

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
first oil embargo at that time I lived

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.100 
first oil embargo at that time I lived
in<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> mobile<00:00:30.840> home<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:33.020> running<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
in a mobile home and I was running that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.869 
in a mobile home and I was running that
mobile<00:00:34.440> home<00:00:34.620> off<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.129> homemade<00:00:35.520> wind

mobile home off of a homemade wind
turbine<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.220> some<00:00:38.220> batteries<00:00:38.699> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.970> had

turbine and some batteries that I had

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.049 
turbine and some batteries that I had
obtained<00:00:39.510> off<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.460> telephone<00:00:41.460> company<00:00:41.940> at

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
obtained off of the telephone company at

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.259 
obtained off of the telephone company at
that<00:00:42.180> time<00:00:43.160> system<00:00:44.160> worked<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> seemed

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
that time system worked but it seemed

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.890 
that time system worked but it seemed
like<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.370> design<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.400> my<00:00:47.730> windmills<00:00:48.180> lacked<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
like the design of my windmills lacked a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.170 
like the design of my windmills lacked a
little<00:00:49.019> bit<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> desired<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.400> was<00:00:50.820> always

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
little bit to be desired so I was always

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
little bit to be desired so I was always
climbing<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> tower<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:54.050> fixing<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.160> but

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
climbing up the tower and fixing it but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.240 
climbing up the tower and fixing it but
hope<00:00:56.730> you'll<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.719> around<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.260> with

hope you'll have a look around here with
me<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.059> next<00:01:00.300> few<00:01:00.450> moments<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.649> we'll

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.660 

well<00:02:20.409> they're<00:02:20.530> certainly<00:02:20.859> going<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.219> be<00:02:21.310> days

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
well they're certainly going to be days

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.280 
well they're certainly going to be days
with<00:02:22.090> very<00:02:22.719> low<00:02:23.530> Sun<00:02:24.010> or<00:02:24.819> maybe<00:02:25.599> it's<00:02:25.810> at<00:02:25.989> night

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
with very low Sun or maybe it's at night

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.220 
with very low Sun or maybe it's at night
and<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:27.670> don't<00:02:27.849> have<00:02:28.000> any<00:02:28.209> solar<00:02:28.870> thermal

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and you don't have any solar thermal

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.330 
and you don't have any solar thermal
energy<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:30.030> solar<00:02:31.030> electricity<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.379> we're

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
energy or solar electricity and we're

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.459 
energy or solar electricity and we're
gonna<00:02:33.489> be<00:02:33.700> running<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> batteries<00:02:34.629> down<00:02:34.870> by

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
gonna be running the batteries down by

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.039 
gonna be running the batteries down by
pulling<00:02:35.950> too<00:02:36.099> much<00:02:36.129> current<00:02:36.639> on<00:02:37.389> days<00:02:37.659> like

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
pulling too much current on days like

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.629 
pulling too much current on days like
that<00:02:38.079> we<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.909> a<00:02:40.349> generator<00:02:41.609> actually<00:02:42.609> I
