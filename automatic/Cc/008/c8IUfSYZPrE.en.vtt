00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and then it stopped then nothing happens

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.200 
and then it stopped then nothing happens
for<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> next<00:01:44.280> few<00:01:44.549> months<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.090> goes

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
for the next few months then it goes

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.020 
for the next few months then it goes
into<00:01:45.240> January<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> goes<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.030> for
