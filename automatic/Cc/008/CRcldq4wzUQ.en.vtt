back natural because i think it would be

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
back natural because i think it would be
easier<00:00:50.660> because<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.079> longer<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.559> hair's<00:00:52.829> got

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
easier because the longer my hair's got

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
easier because the longer my hair's got
