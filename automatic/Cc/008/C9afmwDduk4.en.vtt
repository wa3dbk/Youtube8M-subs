00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.339
 there a few years in Paris 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 I was not bad of I bought a lot 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.480
 originals in the polls released 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.250
 it was not too expensive and then to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 powders a little wonder especially 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 this ethical homepage that I have 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.330
 bought ten years ago and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.800
 that it is 62 69 and that is so 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.550
 djokovic to a great actor 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.170
 Italian who died beat who 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 knew how to combine stupidity and visibility 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 and when I was a child and teenager 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 especially it's really a universe that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.940
 is fascinated embarrassing the stupidity in the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.470
 drawing more interesting the intelligent 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 gemmerlÃ© de giacometti stupidity here is 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.220
 talent I do not know I hope a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 day but not report may not be 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.260
 still conceded 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.550
 and then there are other designers 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.160
 also that they accompany me in this 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.390
 particular cutting piece which is that they 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.820
 sign dive now that they say 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.790
 is not famous effect states power 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 enjoy for a birthday then a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.480
 other dictator that I like a lot more 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.060
 even younger and beautiful city back who 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.820
 want me to make this page 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.799
 a few years ago and stella 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.079
 designates firefighters especially in the 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.229
 editions bamboo and since I returned 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.439
 to editions bamboo so that was my 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 Mom did not sort to go back to do the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.299
 work that I do my cousin is 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.299
 surely 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.990
 good 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.940
 because if most originals are 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.120
 in this room the vast majority 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.700
 is in the boxes and the floor in the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.180
 house in there go I managed 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.210
 to glean legislative originals from 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.940
 Darling 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.340
 dodo laugh a lot of great greats 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.590
 authors like that that most 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.030
 when to do besides and then 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.040
 Touraine friends also like Etienne 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.410
 red like with others 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.510
 so it's already a little bit of time 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 goes back in the boxes and I found 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.320
 the smell and walk and it motivates me 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.130
 for returns and that's good for 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.130
 analyze to work
