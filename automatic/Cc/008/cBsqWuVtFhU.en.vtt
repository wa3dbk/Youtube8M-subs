00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.960
 after 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 or 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.360
 hi to all friends if this party 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.670
 I hope you have the manzana that 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.230
 you have the alcohol you have a little 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.550
 all the illicit materials of the world 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.180
 to make you a good evening like 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.440
 the ridge 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.270
 so that I have a little bit of 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.010
 broken voice I'm sorry 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.500
 it should not be too noticeable 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.180
 I hope you are well educated at 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.950
 minus it's going very well German 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.489
 passage we find ourselves today on 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.070
 the map 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.270
 the plane crash amap at best in you 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.730
 do not have tomorrow what do you want me 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.070
 you repeat it every time by force one 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.629
 end up with the silent m 27 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.160
 very little used weapon and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.810
 today we will talk about a good subject 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.650
 specific 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.700
 maybe you hear it from 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.680
 just now I do not know how 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 I would have done that you must know that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 like there I just put the microphone I 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.479
 had already been playing in fact and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.600
 unfortunately I'm angry and what makes 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.740
 that I speak quite a lot of pitch and that not 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.229
 than to say very things 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 interesting since unfortunately I 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.070
 really go but then really not 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.710
 bad rage and this is the object of 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.350
 our of our our little subject 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.380
 of today so rage had come 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.940
 in me the moment I had three 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.410
 connections in three good gameplay 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.840
 and my account did not want to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.340
 reconnect clear a reconnect it 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.280
 there was a big bug that screwed me up in a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.569
 part like that good here I managed age 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.649
 and I react after everyone I 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.660
 treat everyone from campers 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.119
 anyone anyhow and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.470
 cros will change then I have to know 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.030
 that rabies can be a motivation 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.100
 because as I wear them 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.310
 it was my first part I had 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.380
 not to play a whole party and I 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.450
 flushed good part there was not a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.220
 extraordinary level in front but it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.459
 will be a good and interesting part to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.410
 see 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.310
 we see it at the beginning by the shoot 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 was really not too exceptional 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.530
 but the moves will do everything and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.780
 the interesting gameplay still has 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.610
 so rabies actually when a patient 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.380
 is subject to rage it ends 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.270
 when the threat is no longer present or 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.890
 that the patient out the patient of rage 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.280
 is immobilized that's what happens 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.020
 in psychiatry there is rage that 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 can be obtained by depressions 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.930
 in some people that there is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.390
 several factors 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.620
 in any case rabies is proven it is 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.230
 a stimulus 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.690
 of the brain and that often caused in 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.970
 sport for great sportsmen coach 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.769
 sporting it's a technique they have 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 to create their athletes in fact they 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.209
 try to put themselves in a position 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.920
 superior to the athletes so that the other 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.400
 hate it so it will give him 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.879
 orders 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.860
 a bunch of a bunch of useless order or 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.629
 helpful who are going who will create him a 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.519
 little bit of a confusion and who are going 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.489
 do that he goes pre-tested in the end the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.410
 hate pav going to take if you hate 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.019
 your group coach that you him 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.450
 prove you do as well 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.709
 who says because there is good rage and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.030
 bad rage there is rabies 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.659
 of abandonment source wikipedia at the fact of the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.640
 rage of abandonment when you give up 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.010
 it's ruined it's the bad rage it's 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.239
 the rage of the coward you be at stake you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.480
 go to your corner in the final it's the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.579
 rage call of duty and after you have the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.500
 rage that motivates you a little bit that 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.900
 I had today I was a demon 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.359
 I was moving and yet I was playing 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.739
 as if I were in class and I will do 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.630
 what I wanted I know about jump 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.599
 after the angles of two walls and have 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.370
 summer or I was really brave these 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.290
 measures you have to know that it has me 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.230
 really helped I felt like 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.180
 lava in the veins and even when I 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.129
 put my moment when I had the diplomas 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 there I just saw her 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.389
 I do not have and I did not have a 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.650
 extra stress calm vacation 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.560
 I was really brave until I was viable 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.890
 and you'll see that it's really going 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.780
 help me 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.159
 as you see it from the beginning it 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.440
 it turns out we have half of the gameplay 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.989
 I picked up a sniper and here I go 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.389
 find my being who is also a weapon 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.320
 pretty hard to play really not 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.030
 simple frankly I light in the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.710
 period bo2 because now this is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.090
 call of duty kids who play little because 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.800
 that he is not exceptional at all 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.710
 for my part, for my part, it does not remain 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.330
 that my whole opinion is complete that 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.789
 summarize well what I think about it what I 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.570
 think but the 27 is really not a 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.120
 crazy weapon 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.919
 and yet when I returned I 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.150
 found them too bad there was I know 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.460
 updates 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.320
 a lot of updates but you have to 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.430
 to tell me I found them really low 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.080
 acceptable 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.400
 look it's not that I have a 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.530
 great connection as I wanted 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.229
 say for for this gameplay I have not a 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.940
 connection of madness and yet and 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.310
 yet she served me well 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.260
 you'll see it's not the most 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.509
 specifies the most coolest in the world 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.750
 but then that's back to our 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.310
 about rabies as you see the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.380
 rage is not going to push either to do 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.599
 nonsense because basically in 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.300
 biochemistry rabies arises when look 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.370
 oxytocin and vasopressin alas 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.639
 corticals released in on the hyper 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.750
 deliberately and quickly released by 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.330
 hypothalamus 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.770
 that makes us finally did that it's in 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.479
 biochemistry I will not bother you with 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 that but basically you create 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.940
 hormones corti coop and what compels 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.430
 your cortex has released corticosteroids 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.220
 that's the discoid chord rage 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.720
 in other words it is this reaction in 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.490
 the disco and peel accord up 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.470
 those cells that are released by your 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.639
 hypothalamus that make rabies and rabies 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.470
 again do not play do you 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.620
 not push to totally do me 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.590
 anything there is rage or there you 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.020
 are rude you are call of duty help 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.210
 to rage or when you're sporty 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.700
 again one must at least try 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.010
 to get into the sporty rage 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.080
 is a board then tried I know 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.060
 not without coach it's really hard to get 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.620
 motivate all alone so here we are at 2 25 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.420
 points it's not too bad it's hard to 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.700
 to motivate yourself to say I 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.440
 hate life i'm rude it takes 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.480
 not be brave against the game especially 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.460
 that's not what I mean in 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.670
 this video I do not advise you to 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.160
 rage and tell you anyway it's 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.380
 a game rage and not against the game 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.490
 because you're going to play less 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.350
 well 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.570
 rage against all there it was against my 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.360
 connection between the fact that I do not have 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.260
 have slept waking up against the fact 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.200
 many things 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.720
 in any case in the end it certainly gave me 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.340
 a good package of insult and in addition 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.640
 I put my microphone what serves 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.080
 completely to nothing but these tests is 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.010
 absolutely not constructive the others 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.750
 players have taken full mouth 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.800
 when it's like mutating some of you 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.480
 do not do anything is used to leave 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.400
 in a big debate I do not really like 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.600
 open debates on call of duty in all 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.400
 case this site allowed me to do some 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.890
 trentin of ratio which is not too bad 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.810
 it's not too disgusting 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.770
 certainly there were the strict scores that 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.300
 have not made me tons and tons 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.840
 they have more than they had to do me 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.460
 do 5 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.850
 but it's still nice to have 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.780
 good gameplay like that I hope that 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.020
 that I would like to give perhaps a 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.880
 idea 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.740
 try frankly rage is a little 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.510
 it can do no good for health 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.940
 unfortunately but for the gameplay it 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.070
 could do him good we find ourselves for 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.390
 an upcoming video and kisses to all his 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.380
 friends think about putting a green thumb is to 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.860
 subscribe perceived to chains 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.260
 Community
