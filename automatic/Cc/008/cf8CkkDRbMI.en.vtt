00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.639
 the most popular brioche in Alsace and 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.230
 that I graft I can tell you this is 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.269
 really very very good it's 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.270
 relatively easy to do the longest 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.650
 that's the key because the bigger the chip 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.020
 will be long more raincourt the offer at 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.300
 left for the kouglof his request 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.710
 really very close what we already have 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.750
 can do the dough by hand or not yes 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.039

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.269
 problem does the dough by hand but one 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.110
 shows you the machine because a whole 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.989
 little bit lazy but that's normal 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.829
 at their level you put everything euphoric 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:46.360
 I put the family first I loved 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:47.440
 sugars and salt I add the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.940
 yeast it is dry 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.160
 there is a bakery wear one can 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.840
 really use the very hot 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 so my trades double the weight 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 remove the case frêche au neuf tout simple 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.460
 as aldo the CEOs ben yes that's where the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.549
 butter it's after laurent kneaded speed 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.290
 slow as all the buns 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.299
 we hung he had a little hook 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.049
 very simple we will knead to give 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.500
 body for that butane way work 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.930
 then the other 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.020
 so as soon as the dough get picked up their 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.210
 overtaking but who sticks who burned 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.329
 leaustic the trailer must add the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.680
 brazil on May 20 last a witness so 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.079

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 where is the butter and integrated 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.800
 in the dough 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 yeah there meanwhile for an hour 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 I have my greenhouse and raisins with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 rum they are good that's okay 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.380
 perfume the leg after and after 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.800
 take that the raisins did not find 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.620
 not their chaplain general accor gilles 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 beer is good the dough is ready to 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.930
 send the neighbors who are super good 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.989
 integrated 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.299
 I would have many forms and brabham who 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.420
 can take like that by a little movie 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.180
 a very clean I'm here for not 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.439
 decision maker so be a little united 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.049
 for pasta groping road 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.140
 Okay, we were worried about a dish towel as well 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.060
 also and we will leave in the corner the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.290
 more temperate of your cooking story 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.480
 than its double volume then actually 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.829
 it's a first fermentation that goes 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.060
 bring some taste that will make you 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.739
 go see a couple offers that really 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.049
 really a great band it's really 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.189
 very fragrant a little bit of acid a 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.590
 little bit like the base in the wine 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.060
 our paw 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.769
 she doubled in volume so she is 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.930
 really impeccable we started the chip 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.000
 we will fold it first we go 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.060
 start with the flap 3 it is fine 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 see with the film paper is that she 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.019
 did not really crunch and look 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.379
 look here at the builder team and 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.669
 abusers but from the beginnings of what 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.980
 what really is the proof of the 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:15.489
 more unfortunately we will chase the air then d 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.269
 here we are really from here we go 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.090
 hunt the air that's to fold then 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.769
 now in your pretty mill we're going 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.199
 prepare the blogging water fabien 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.819
 the blu ray you go to see me 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.590
 go beret by hand it's important 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.440
 of it's really important like that it 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.780
 will not you be attached during 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.889
 casts that flour not just not 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 a lot of fathers so what is 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.430
 important is that the dough a kouglof 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 and already have them so if there is little 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.530
 risk of clashes okay so the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.629
 kill 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.650
 I knew myself that it is a number with a 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.540
 mast because in fact you do not have the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.109
 ways to buy the person here and there 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.269
 I will place the fines down there 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.090
 to really have a very pretty case 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.639
 effects or casts and the manager 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.729
 nars the little paw kougelhopf to 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.769
 raiders here you go, I take it to the center 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.290
 comes out little by little my red dog 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.939
 around the world 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.319
 you try to spread the mass 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.519
 close agreement after another it will do 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.659
 his work when it's okay anymore it's because 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.459
 that I remember we will do it 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.829
 push the second time after the break 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.359
 it's going to split up and complicate the 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.310
 kouglof it's a big one is that is 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.870
 simple on the other hand it takes time and 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.870
 love 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.620
 that's important we're hyper re do 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.610
 this is really too good 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.050
 I love pasta at the bei sector 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.440
 it emanates a woman in the brioche is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.699

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.800
 there we shoot well to bring like that 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.720
 you've seen the mold it's not everything 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.790
 actually filled the shoot when is going to be 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.830
 flanker faraman doubled in volume 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.970
 we'll go to the oven ok we did it 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.370
 puts in the corner the smaller ones to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.560
 your kitchen next to the radiator next 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.850
 of the oven especially no drafts and 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 then let's see nature where everything goes 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.510
 well as long as these facts eventually 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.400
 a small oven in an oven off you

 left a voice around and the oven 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.110
 hot and you'll see it's a 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.940
 handicap 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.289
