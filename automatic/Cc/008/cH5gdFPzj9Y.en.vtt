00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 we have here the international scoop 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 of both games the franchise 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.040
 of fifa has set the bar for the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.059
 authenticity of innovation in the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 world of sports in real time 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.480
 we have all the drama and lack of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.780
 credibility of football 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.710
 offers creativity freedom in attack 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.540
 takes us to a new level allows us 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.829
 control the action on the ground without 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.640
 have to interrupt in a moment the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.640
 game let's take a look 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.430
 we are watching a fifa video we are 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.860
 10 with kinect we can 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.270
 to act as deliverers and do 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.720
 substitutions to adapt to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.720
 any situation 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.770
 that is, controlling fifa contains 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.439
 we can even change the tactic on 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 the march without interrupting the game without 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.710
 have to resort to a menu 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 fit 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.010
 we can also give control to 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 team members in the attack and the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.040
 defending 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.979
 and then we also have the function of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 referee that allows us to see how 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.080
 we react to the decisions of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.080
 referee 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.290
 the referee with this curious 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 and if we screw up at the time of 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.070
 express ourselves as the weight will have its 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.070
 repercussions 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.009
 two 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.050
 the xbox360 format let's move on now to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.050
