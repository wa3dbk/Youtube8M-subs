ring and then they offer you a chart for

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.280 
ring and then they offer you a chart for
gapping<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.920> Rings<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:20.550> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.360> file<00:01:21.960> fit

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
gapping the Rings you have to file fit

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.400 
gapping the Rings you have to file fit
the<00:01:22.440> Rings<00:01:22.650> mine<00:01:23.550> is<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.560> Boeing<00:01:25.560> gas<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
the Rings mine is a Boeing gas so you

00:01:28.410 --> 00:02:11.440 
the Rings mine is a Boeing gas so you
take

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.839 

okay<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.349> have<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.650> square<00:02:13.099> it<00:02:13.130> off<00:02:13.370> meaning

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
okay you have to square it off meaning

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.550 
okay you have to square it off meaning
it's<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.450> be<00:02:14.510> equal<00:02:14.690> distance<00:02:15.290> from<00:02:15.349> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
it's got to be equal distance from the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.100 
it's got to be equal distance from the
top<00:02:15.739> deck<00:02:15.980> down<00:02:16.910> below<00:02:17.239> all<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.810> around

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
top deck down below all the way around

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.010 
top deck down below all the way around
so<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.160> cheap<00:02:19.550> ring<00:02:20.239> boring<00:02:20.750> tool

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
so this is this a cheap ring boring tool

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.460 
so this is this a cheap ring boring tool
basically<00:02:21.440> here's<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.580> game<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.840> put

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
basically here's the game of this I put

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.680 
basically here's the game of this I put
it<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.250> opposite<00:02:25.670> side<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.270> actual

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
it to the opposite side of the actual

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.460 
it to the opposite side of the actual
ring<00:02:26.870> gap<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.030> ring<00:02:29.569> swearing's<00:02:30.020> was<00:02:30.200> just

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
ring gap so the ring swearing's was just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.199 
ring gap so the ring swearing's was just
sitting<00:02:30.830> there<00:02:30.890> what<00:02:31.670> you're<00:02:31.850> going<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
just push it on flat till this ignition

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.620 
just push it on flat till this ignition
is<00:02:35.810> sitting<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> deck

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.520 

all<00:02:44.170> around<00:02:44.740> it's<00:02:45.070> touching<00:02:47.940> pull<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.090> out

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
all around it's touching pull it out

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.460 
all around it's touching pull it out
okay<00:02:50.530> now<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.970> ring<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.360> squared<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.380> that's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
okay now your ring is squared so that's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.250 
okay now your ring is squared so that's
what<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.710> reading<00:02:54.010> squaring<00:02:54.550> tool<00:02:54.730> does<00:02:55.260> you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
what a reading squaring tool does you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.280 
what a reading squaring tool does you
can<00:02:56.410> also<00:02:56.590> use<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> piston<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.840> put<00:02:59.020> an<00:02:59.140> old

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
can also use a piston you can put an old

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.730 
can also use a piston you can put an old
ring<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.190> piston<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> second<00:03:01.360> groove

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
ring on the piston on the second groove

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.250 
ring on the piston on the second groove
the<00:03:02.740> piston<00:03:03.130> an<00:03:03.220> upside<00:03:03.610> down<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.570> put<00:03:05.080> in

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
the piston an upside down and put in

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.250 
the piston an upside down and put in
that<00:03:05.290> way<00:03:05.620> too

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that way too

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.640 
that way too
the<00:03:08.260> choice<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.350> check

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the choice is up to you so you check

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.920 
the choice is up to you so you check
with<00:03:11.770> your<00:03:11.830> feeler<00:03:12.310> gauge<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:13.000> want<00:03:13.180> feeling

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
with your feeler gauge you want feeling

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.440 
with your feeler gauge you want feeling
age<00:03:14.050> becomes<00:03:14.530> hug<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.490> don't<00:03:15.580> want<00:03:15.820> sloppy<00:03:16.270> or

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
age becomes hug you don't want sloppy or

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.510 
age becomes hug you don't want sloppy or
loose<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:17.020> little<00:03:17.170> bit<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.530> tension<00:03:17.740> just<00:03:18.190> just

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
loose a little bit of tension just just

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.280 
loose a little bit of tension just just
a<00:03:18.610> little<00:03:18.850> bit<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.660> okay

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
a little bit was in okay

00:03:20.290 --> 00:04:07.420 
a little bit was in okay
you<00:03:20.680> read<00:03:20.890> your<00:03:21.070> fewer<00:03:21.370> gate

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.180 

and<00:04:07.879> bring<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.209> over<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.480> my<00:04:08.720> ring<00:04:09.200> baler<00:04:09.620> and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and bring it over to my ring baler and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.860 
and bring it over to my ring baler and
you<00:04:10.310> just<00:04:10.489> one<00:04:10.700> side<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.390> ring<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:11.720> don't

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
you just one side of the ring you don't

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.229 
you just one side of the ring you don't
want<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.170> do<00:04:12.260> both<00:04:12.530> side<00:04:12.830> because<00:04:13.489> one<00:04:13.760> side<00:04:14.060> is

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
want to do both side because one side is

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.810 
want to do both side because one side is
already<00:04:14.569> perfectly<00:04:15.140> where<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.280> all<00:04:16.489> just

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
already perfectly where so it all just

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:43.400 
already perfectly where so it all just
take<00:04:17.030> off<00:04:17.329> one<00:04:18.290> side

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.200 

so<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.980> ring<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.160> put<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.610> up<00:04:45.730> against<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
