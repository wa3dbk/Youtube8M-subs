00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello youtube friends here presenting 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:11.540
 the windows update of this 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.310
 Lumia 610 to windows with 7.8 here we are going to 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.500
 present how the 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.670
 update plus the video is only 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.160
 demonstrative in the bottom 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.660
 check please 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.590
 the instructions to follow for 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.079
 alumina of 610 and 710 the man of 800 and 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.910
 the 900 all of them can be updated 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.690
 in the following way that I have found 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.949
 update without having to do any 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.530
 type of pit to reinforce the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.540
 software so that the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 update is not necessary any 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 kind of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.440
 of trick art and magic and witchcraft 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.750
 etcetera then nothing else get the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.010
 simple steps you can update what 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.199
 We have tested the phones and have 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.489
 worked perfectly then not 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.170
 I doubt that this update is this 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 effective for all others who have 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.770
 a windows with and want to update it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.909
 to the wind 27.8 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 well then let's insert the 1,610 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.700
 to see its benefits 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.440
 with this operating system windows with 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.330
 7.8 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 well, well let's turn it on 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.510
 there is lighting 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.260
 it exists much faster than 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.260
 previous versions 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.920
 although good a little slows down 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 but good is minimal 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.200
 no longer feels the use no longer feels 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.940
 here we see if they are fixed we can see the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 couple 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.380
 this the four sizes of here are 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.950
 little ones and this one is super giant 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.780
 phone and this is one of the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.280
 features of windows phone 7 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.510
 points 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.250
 let's try 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.250
 so they can see that it appears 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 good 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.390
 we see the function 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.450
 d 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.680
 what little one 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.840
 the supergiant 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.290
 and go back to normal this is one of 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 the functions that come by default in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.700
 windows phones 7.8 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.340
 also about this version we can this 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.530
 send you this files by bluetooth 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530
 we have the option to start for example 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.730
 the lock screen with the background of 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.930
 bing 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.930
 this is updated daily 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.760
 this is updated daily 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.530
 then there will be no problem for that 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.810
 and they will have a daily image 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.829
 different and some other many 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.829
 benefits of this system 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.209

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.849

 through the internet 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.690
 this one takes 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.010
 there is nothing absolute like in the version 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.010
 interior is super fast 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.910
 it is handled in a super way 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.310
 surprisingly fast 256 megabytes of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.870
 memory and a processor or exercise 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.230
