00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
it's if I am just gonna record for a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
it's if I am just gonna record for a
video<00:03:25.169> because<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.949> does<00:03:26.370> take<00:03:26.639> time<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.090> be

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
video because it does take time to be

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.599 
video because it does take time to be
creative<00:03:27.479> especially<00:03:28.379> when<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.280> many<00:03:29.459> people

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
creative especially when so many people

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.180 
creative especially when so many people
are<00:03:30.030> doing<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.569> nowadays<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.349> it's<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.709> you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
are doing it nowadays so it's like you

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.619 
are doing it nowadays so it's like you
have<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.579> be<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.909> little<00:03:33.150> bit<00:03:33.269> more<00:03:33.419> creative

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
have to be a little bit more creative

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.569 
have to be a little bit more creative
and<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.229> figure<00:03:34.409> out<00:03:34.620> what<00:03:35.250> what's

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
and you have to figure out what what's

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.210 
and you have to figure out what what's
my<00:03:35.699> concept<00:03:36.359> gonna<00:03:36.629> be<00:03:36.810> because<00:03:37.220> beatboxing

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
my concept gonna be because beatboxing

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.699 
my concept gonna be because beatboxing
is<00:03:38.310> good<00:03:38.489> way<00:03:38.639> for<00:03:38.669> me<00:03:39.120> personally<00:03:39.389> like<00:03:39.659> I<00:03:39.870> got

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
is good way for me personally like I got

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.860 
is good way for me personally like I got
into<00:03:40.979> beatboxing<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:41.879> let<00:03:42.120> out<00:03:42.299> steam

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
into beatboxing to just let out steam

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.500 
into beatboxing to just let out steam
and<00:03:43.440> then<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:44.159> didn't<00:03:44.699> have<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> lot<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.239> people

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
and then I didn't have a lot of people

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.240 
and then I didn't have a lot of people
around<00:03:45.599> me<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.959> talk<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.199> so<00:03:46.590> beat<00:03:46.769> boxin<00:03:47.159> was
