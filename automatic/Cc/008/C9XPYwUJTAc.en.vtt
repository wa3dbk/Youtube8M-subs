00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.289 
wrong and that shouldn't be what it is
but<00:03:54.720> sadly<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.890> what<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.310> regardless<00:03:57.150> of

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
but sadly it is what it is regardless of

with no curse words expletive profanity
and<00:04:21.329> it's<00:04:21.810> because<00:04:22.550> regardless<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and it's because regardless of the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
feel like this is a thing that just

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.779 
feel like this is a thing that just
happens<00:04:34.169> all<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.409> time<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:35.039> haven't<00:04:35.400> went<00:04:35.610> to

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789

events in some time now but I don't
expect<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.539> stuff<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.960> stop<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.469> expect<00:04:41.159> it<00:04:41.310> to

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
expect this stuff to stop I expect it to

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.459 
expect this stuff to stop I expect it to
continue<00:04:41.729> happening<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.569> people<00:04:43.080> believe

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
continue happening and people believe

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.390 
continue happening and people believe
that<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.610> not<00:04:44.789> their<00:04:45.120> fault<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:46.400> regardless

that it's not their fault and regardless
if<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.729> is<00:04:47.849> wrong<00:04:48.060> for<00:04:48.750> them<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.770> think<00:04:50.039> like

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
if it is wrong for them to think like

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.459 
if it is wrong for them to think like
this<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.759> you're<00:04:51.449> not<00:04:51.599> doing<00:04:51.900> anything<00:04:52.139> wrong

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
this and you're not doing anything wrong

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.679 
this and you're not doing anything wrong
by<00:04:52.949> having<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.550> book<00:04:53.729> out<00:04:53.909> that's<00:04:54.330> perceived

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
by having this book out that's perceived

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.439 
by having this book out that's perceived
worse<00:04:55.020> thousands<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.949> bucks<00:04:56.129> it's<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.180> fact

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
worse thousands of bucks it's the fact

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.629 
worse thousands of bucks it's the fact
that<00:04:57.569> people<00:04:57.689> have<00:04:58.590> different<00:04:58.770> mindsets<00:04:59.129> and

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
that people have different mindsets and

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.430 
that people have different mindsets and
they<00:04:59.849> come<00:05:00.090> from<00:05:00.300> different<00:05:00.389> backgrounds<00:05:00.900> and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
they come from different backgrounds and

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.860 
they come from different backgrounds and
I<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:02.250> think<00:05:02.520> even<00:05:03.030> if<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.330> don't<00:05:03.569> come<00:05:03.780> from

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
I just think even if you don't come from

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.510 
I just think even if you don't come from
that<00:05:04.020> background<00:05:04.199> you<00:05:04.740> should<00:05:04.860> not<00:05:05.219> want

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
that background you should not want

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.770 
that background you should not want
something<00:05:05.879> that<00:05:06.440> ideally<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:08.610> worked<00:05:08.879> for<00:05:09.000> it

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
something that ideally you worked for it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.360 
something that ideally you worked for it
could<00:05:09.930> be<00:05:10.080> anything<00:05:10.379> you<00:05:10.949> don't<00:05:11.069> want

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
could be anything you don't want

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.309 
could be anything you don't want
somebody<00:05:11.819> just<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.300> snatch<00:05:12.569> it<00:05:12.780> from<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:13.139> and

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
somebody just to snatch it from you and

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.070 
somebody just to snatch it from you and
I<00:05:13.680> feel<00:05:14.069> like<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.909> flaunting<00:05:15.539> something<00:05:15.930> like

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
I feel like you flaunting something like

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.189 
I feel like you flaunting something like
this<00:05:16.289> is<00:05:16.469> a<00:05:16.979> primary<00:05:17.789> way<00:05:18.000> how<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.870> make

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
this is a primary way how you make

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.189 
this is a primary way how you make
yourself<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.650> target<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.219> that's<00:05:20.550> why<00:05:20.849> people

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
yourself a target and that's why people

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.730 
yourself a target and that's why people
get<00:05:22.199> robbed

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
get robbed

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.040 
get robbed

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
just not something to be proud of but

just not something to be proud of but
I'm<00:05:29.430> saying<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.969> feel<00:05:30.029> that<00:05:30.479> there<00:05:30.659> is<00:05:30.689> some
