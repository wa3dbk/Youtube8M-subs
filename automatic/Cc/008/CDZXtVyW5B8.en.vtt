00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
the transformation mode of the zeta

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.840 
the transformation mode of the zeta
gundam<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:05.279> i'm<00:00:05.370> just<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.640> go<00:00:05.730> ahead

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this is a parts forma if you will it's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.840 
this is a parts forma if you will it's
not<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> great<00:00:21.330> transformation<00:00:21.660> mode<00:00:22.550> as<00:00:23.550> with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
not a great transformation mode as with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.540 
not a great transformation mode as with
some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> other<00:00:26.900> Gundam<00:00:27.900> kits<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.550> part

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
some of the other Gundam kits and part

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.679 
some of the other Gundam kits and part
of<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> fact<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.630> just

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of that has to do with the fact of just

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.530 
of that has to do with the fact of just
the<00:00:31.470> size<00:00:32.570> because<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:35.030> model<00:00:36.030> kit<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:39.210> some

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the size because the model kit in some

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
the size because the model kit in some
cases<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.079> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.770> ways<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.040> kind

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
cases it's kind of some ways it's kind

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.470 
cases it's kind of some ways it's kind
of<00:00:41.219> unfortunate<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.030> other<00:00:42.180> ways<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of unfortunate but in other ways I think

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
of unfortunate but in other ways I think
it<00:00:42.750> works<00:00:44.989> because<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:48.469> swear<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.620> only<00:00:49.800> when

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it works because I swear it's only when

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.350 
it works because I swear it's only when
i'm<00:00:50.010> doing<00:00:50.100> reduce<00:00:50.370> stuff<00:00:50.670> decides<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> fall

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
i'm doing reduce stuff decides to fall

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:03.799 
i'm doing reduce stuff decides to fall
off<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> anyways<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.600> smart

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
off but anyways the i think it was smart

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.010 
off but anyways the i think it was smart
I'm<00:01:04.260> bandaged<00:01:04.769> part<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:06.020> parts

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'm bandaged part to make it up a parts

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.130 
I'm bandaged part to make it up a parts
former<00:01:09.560> because<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:12.020> bump<00:01:13.020> the

camera I have the kaerios condom and I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.560 
camera I have the kaerios condom and I
don't<00:01:22.369> in<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.610> respects<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
don't in some respects I like the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.999 
don't in some respects I like the
transformation<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> curios<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
transformation one on the curios and the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
transformation one on the curios and the
other<00:01:26.130> ones<00:01:26.340> i<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> i<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> zeta

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
other ones i don't and i think the zeta

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
other ones i don't and i think the zeta
gundam<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.650> transformation<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> high<00:01:30.390> grade

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
gundam is transformation and high grade

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.969 
gundam is transformation and high grade
does<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.380> better<00:01:31.680> job<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> curios

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
does a lot better job than the curios

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:48.780 
does a lot better job than the curios
high<00:01:34.979> grade<00:01:39.320> yeah

of<00:03:32.650> complain<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> little<00:03:33.459> bit<00:03:33.640> about<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:34.090> be

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
of complain a little bit about would be

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.710 
of complain a little bit about would be
wave<00:03:34.420> rider<00:03:34.630> mode<00:03:34.840> though<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.239> haven't

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
wave rider mode though is it I haven't

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.060 
wave rider mode though is it I haven't
figured<00:03:37.959> out<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.080> configuration<00:03:38.739> yet<00:03:38.920> that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
figured out a configuration yet that

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.350 
figured out a configuration yet that
attaches<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.580> an<00:03:39.730> action<00:03:40.030> base<00:03:40.150> which<00:03:40.330> is

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
attaches it to an action base which is

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.800 
attaches it to an action base which is
unfortunate<00:03:40.959> because<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:43.330> was<00:03:43.510> either

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
unfortunate because if there was either

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.509 
unfortunate because if there was either
mode<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.320> think<00:03:44.530> would<00:03:44.620> look<00:03:44.680> really<00:03:45.160> cool

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
mode that I think would look really cool

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.710 
mode that I think would look really cool
on<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.940> action<00:03:46.150> base<00:03:46.239> which<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.450> not<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.690> say

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
on the action base which is not to say

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.110 
on the action base which is not to say
that<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.049> data<00:03:47.320> on<00:03:47.590> them<00:03:47.709> itself<00:03:48.070> doesn't<00:03:48.610> but

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
that the data on them itself doesn't but

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.090 
that the data on them itself doesn't but
i<00:03:49.330> think<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.230> Waverider<00:03:50.680> would<00:03:50.830> look<00:03:50.980> even

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
i think the Waverider would look even

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.080 
i think the Waverider would look even
cooler<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:53.019> flying<00:03:53.290> around<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:53.880> yeah<00:03:54.880> for

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
cooler like flying around but yeah for

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.470 
cooler like flying around but yeah for
whatever<00:03:55.299> reason<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.660> does<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.680> fact<00:03:56.739> not

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
whatever reason this does in fact not

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.940 
whatever reason this does in fact not
attached<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.750> action<00:03:59.019> based

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
attached to the action based

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.190 
attached to the action based
you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.550> however<00:04:01.720> attach<00:04:02.720> his<00:04:02.900> weapons<00:04:05.200> so

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
you can however attach his weapons so

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.380 
you can however attach his weapons so
you<00:04:06.290> sleep<00:04:06.830> there<00:04:07.160> goes<00:04:07.340> again<00:04:07.580> that's<00:04:07.940> stupid

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
you sleep there goes again that's stupid

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.940 
you sleep there goes again that's stupid
piece<00:04:08.720> from<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.080> back<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.500> leg<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.739> don't

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.550 
piece from the back of the leg I don't
know<00:04:10.069> why<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.629> it's<00:04:11.629> never<00:04:11.930> been<00:04:12.110> tight<00:04:12.349> on

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
know why it it's never been tight on

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.170 
know why it it's never been tight on
mine<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:13.069> don't<00:04:13.459> know<00:04:13.519> if<00:04:13.610> anyone<00:04:13.849> else<00:04:13.940> has

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
landing gear pieces which you can attach

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:38.320 
landing gear pieces which you can attach
to<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.570> launcher<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:34.060> oh<00:04:36.970> yeah<00:04:37.970> these<00:04:38.120> ones

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
to the launcher and oh yeah these ones

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:47.530 
to the launcher and oh yeah these ones
go<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.570> back<00:04:40.450> took<00:04:41.450> up<00:04:41.690> I'm<00:04:42.020> side<00:04:46.389> took<00:04:47.389> my

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
go in the back took up I'm side took my

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.760 
go in the back took up I'm side took my
second<00:04:47.780> run<00:04:47.930> with<00:04:48.110> his<00:04:48.320> those<00:04:48.500> ones<00:04:48.530> were

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
second run with his those ones were

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.190 
second run with his those ones were
supposed<00:04:48.979> to<00:04:49.070> go<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.419> yeah<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.870> have<00:04:51.050> him

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
supposed to go so yeah you can have him

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.960 
supposed to go so yeah you can have him
with<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.979> landing<00:04:52.250> gear<00:04:52.400> on<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.760> then<00:04:52.880> he

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
with the landing gear on and then he

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.710 
with the landing gear on and then he
stays<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.570> lot<00:04:53.750> better<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:55.000> get<00:04:56.000> out<00:04:56.090> they<00:04:56.419> can't

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
stays a lot better so get out they can't

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.300 
stays a lot better so get out they can't
attack<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:57.350> an<00:04:57.440> action<00:04:57.710> berries<00:04:57.889> in<00:04:58.010> this<00:04:58.130> mode

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
attack to an action berries in this mode

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.710 
attack to an action berries in this mode
but<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.610> guess<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:58.910> kind<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.150> makes<00:04:59.210> up<00:04:59.450> for<00:04:59.479> it

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
but I guess that kind of makes up for it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.210 
but I guess that kind of makes up for it
a<00:04:59.750> little<00:04:59.900> bit<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.260> then<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:01.250> other<00:05:01.280> rifle

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
a little bit and then the other rifle

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.920 
a little bit and then the other rifle
you<00:05:04.220> couldn't<00:05:04.550> pop<00:05:04.729> in<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.620> top<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.830> big

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
you couldn't pop in the top of the big

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.290 
you couldn't pop in the top of the big
stabilizer<00:05:08.930> tail<00:05:09.169> things<00:05:09.470> so<00:05:10.090> basically<00:05:11.090> can

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
stabilizer tail things so basically can

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.540 
stabilizer tail things so basically can
fly<00:05:11.450> around<00:05:11.539> with<00:05:11.780> both<00:05:11.900> weapons<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:13.280> this

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
fly around with both weapons in this

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.680 
fly around with both weapons in this
mode<00:05:15.820> now<00:05:16.820> as<00:05:16.940> far<00:05:17.090> as<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> instruction

manual<00:05:17.720> goes<00:05:19.780> it's<00:05:20.780> basically<00:05:21.470> set<00:05:21.650> up<00:05:21.740> the
