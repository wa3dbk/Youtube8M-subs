interpretation<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:51.830> flying<00:01:52.280> yeah<00:01:53.030> it's

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
interpretation of like flying yeah it's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.609 
interpretation of like flying yeah it's
supposed<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.509> give<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.079> feeling<00:01:54.320> that

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619
