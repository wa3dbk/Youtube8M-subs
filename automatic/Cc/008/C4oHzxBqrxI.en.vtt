00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.929
 Hi again 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.710
 as you can see already the radio power 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.180
 mounted all connectors even 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:21.880
 even the steering wheel buttons 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:25.570
 involved so little by 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:31.070
 connect as recommended 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.130
 red power minus taken from the body 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.310
 car and bolted to the body 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.699
 radio there for under the screws 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.570
 place so 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.180
 power cord was a little bit finalized here 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.829
 was embed minus this in order to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.710
 connect one of the button wires from 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:01:01.809
 steering on the minus here after not for and not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:06.520
 insulated for more shows 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.350
 were times by or connector and accordingly 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.979
 purchased store 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.810
 maybe see everything done planted on 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.430
 Shrink connector cases I almost 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.540
 later just what now not to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.690
 clutter up in a soft one over here 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.250
 here you can see the soft foam adhesive 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.420
 so that all this doesnâ€™t rattle too 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 so that there is no thundering inside 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.490
 microphone did not connect enough 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.810
 checked for quite built-in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:53.600
 already connected the subwoofer now I will 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.450
 put the frame need to stretch another cord 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.280
 half a year 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.429
 by the way here from the radio 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.429
 now Iâ€™ll show you all 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.490
 layout is more convenient and straight here 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.700
 a cord that will most likely rest 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.920
 back there somewhere the panel here here it is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.670
 curved in principle he came here but 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 as seen here in the middle row average 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 the row here are four pins and here are just 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.960
 3 1 for badly missing so you are quite 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:41.110
 came up 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:44.950
 Well, in length from the company of songs he is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.390
 more ergonomic white and literally on 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.390
 50 centimeters longer 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.970
 I would like to put it but unfortunately 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.900
 on connectors and went to break out teeth 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.630
 there, too, I'm not going to never know 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.330
 there is no contact for him yet 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 stretched out 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.770
 I will put a frame in principle, all in essence 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.890
 replacement cases 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.380
 radio with birth and with radio 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.520
 It varies as the film says something tupim 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.810
 there is a plug in the jack is nothing tricky 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.560
 here the chips come unfastened 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.340
 This is its own chip connects and everything is well and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.870
 here all these extra channels 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.440
 reversing camera by the way connected 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.420
 checked everything works very simple 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.010
 spike time took somewhere order 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.570
 two hours let 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.940
 I think pulse 2 and a half by the way forgot 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.740
 more to say about this one 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.620
 here's the connector is the antenna input about for 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.220
 antennas 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.510
 In the instructions for the radio tape recorder it is not signed 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.019
 was but it turned out that the antenna flew in 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.330
 the antenna which was used for 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:16.459
 red power recorder about the meaning 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.630
 for the erisson radio tape recorder cut off the connector and 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.540
 soldered ordinary jack this connector was 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:31.940
 cut off and on guy was jack antenna 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:35.750
 left weighed but in principle it seems to be 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.289
 By alterations it is all gps antenna is not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.180
 has become 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:44.650
 leave a full-time red power left the hotel 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.880
 they are all basically the same tiande 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.680
 different can only be plug then 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.520
 eat here 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.020
 straight 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.500
 here this one at an angle of 45 and 90 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.960
 degrees, that's basically all in general 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:07.650
 Now I draw the lace from the ipod 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.900
 frame and all the radio in place you can 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.900
 to use 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900
 thank
