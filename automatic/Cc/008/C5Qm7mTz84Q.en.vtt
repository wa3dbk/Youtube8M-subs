00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.649
 I greet all the readers of filo space. blog spot.com we return to talk 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.670
 of photoshop bases 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.229
 today 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.350
 let's analyze a topic 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.210
 quite special 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.770
 and let's talk about replacing color 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.609
 what is it 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.480
 very practically we will replace 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.800
 one color with another in this case 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.229
 of child t-shirts 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.740
 tantra little mouse 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.120
 turn it into another selling color 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.760
 fuchsia magenta 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.250
 app to burn 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.050
 before 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.080
 what to do in publishing clearly 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.990
 level 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.850
 duplicate the level 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.820
 let's go to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.130
 to act 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.150
 on milk 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.050
 up with text 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.330
 shirt and then the first thing to do 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.429
 create a selection 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.340
 and on the shirt because it will allow us to act only and only 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.280
 on the shirt on the air 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.799
 on the whole photograph 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.880
 to create a section 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 I used the pen tool 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.480
 who like you have seen the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 last time 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 works with all the anchors so she's very slowly let's create 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.150
 the track 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.300
 in my case 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.620
 I already did 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
 and this one here 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 once the path has been created 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.830
 and therefore our future 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.400
 let's go 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.880
 learn the track panel accessed on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.440
 window 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 I have traces of it as I have it 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 holding down the control key we click on the track in question 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.349
 at this point as you see photoshop and created a nice selection around me 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.429
 has the child's shirt 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.899
 3 I remember that 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.190
 accurate 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.469
 will be a monster 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.539
 more accurate selection 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.360
 the can traced 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.689
 so very very precise more. 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.159
 the villages and the selection 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.289
 they will be 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.119
 better from year 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.619
 this is clear 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:38.239
 ananda assisi trilivelli color photoshop cs4 puts us 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.580
 available the tool that is called its own color replacement here 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.480
 come on 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.579
 image 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.589
 adjustments 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.589
 color replacement 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.739
 this is the dialog box that the program 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.189
 proposes us 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.959
 how how it works 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.809
 before 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.900
 we have to decide a high 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.479
 alle ranza 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 and then go 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.479
 select with the dropper 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:18.120
 the areas of color that we want to replace in the shirt 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.859
 such areas of color 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.309
 they are kings 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.799
 therefore all 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.679
 for the nuances 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:31.279
 and all the spare parts nicola, that is to say, fuchsia is not just magenta 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.279
 for me it is only this time 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.449
 and even this darker pink this lighter pink this rose even more 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.159
 light and dark etc. etc. quirinale to select them all 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.550
 increasing now the tolerance of mendel carefully mind. 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.339
 holding down the shift key 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:56.489
 we can go and select a little all you see that slowly 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.990
 if you have selected 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.629
 selection 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.459
 in the field here 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.239
 the photograph goes 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.910
 the vattaro mask 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.910
 understand more and more colors 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.569
 once selected all the fields we want to increase we decrease the 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.829
 tolerance 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.199
 carefully 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.949
 so you have to do a lot of tests to be 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.689
 to have a good result especially at the beginning 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.409
 however away 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.460
 and then in the end it turns out thone will be worth it 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.789
 there are two ways to replace color 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.729
 one by clicking on the result 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.659
 or by opening a window 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.639
 this 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.099
 hey select the color directly 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.349
 I personally don't like going to play with tonality 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.379
 brightness saturation 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.379
 and here for example if you want to put a wolf 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.590
 I carry the shade 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.370
 the left 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.809
 increase structuring 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.169
 a low one 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.159
 and draws play 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.900
 therefore a these 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.210
 these tools 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.330
 and see that slowly 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.789
 color 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.789
 comments 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:27.430
 We can 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.349
 even a certain point 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.039
 increase tolerance more and more a power includes more and more young 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.229
 and then 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.210
 keep playing 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.650
 at this point when we are satisfied we click on ok 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.659
 we make comparisons and give the selection 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.080
 at this point you will see that you have just replaced the cobra 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.930
 primus fuchsia 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.430
 now it's blue 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.430
 I also made you a garda 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.229
 you see 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.050
 the tool is 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.439
 MatarÃ² 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.210
 but not indifferent 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.400
 clearly I left some areas because the route just made 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.610
 very hurriedly though you drink 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.369
 you can work harder than me and you and don't leave these areas as a police nuance 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:25.869
 via the command 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.550
 select 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.310
 change symbols to the letter b 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.310
 recruitment letter 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.839
 pre-selected modified creation 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:43.830
 fades 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.589
 or expand 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.550
 francesco a sparkling the edges 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.440
 stay on 1 2 3 pixels maximum 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.529
 and expand expand 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.849
 . the pixels that in deciding 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.719
 the selection then recommend 1 2 3 pixels if you have been 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:02.610
 that like me 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.419
 inaccurate on iphone 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.270
 the tutorial ends here I remember that it is 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.239
