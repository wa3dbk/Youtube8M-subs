00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
know exactly what to expect but there

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.900 
know exactly what to expect but there
are<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> couple<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> things<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.129> wanted<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
are a couple of things that I wanted and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
are a couple of things that I wanted and
I<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.239> totally<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:40.020> did<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> at

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950

all<00:00:41.070> being<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:41.969> older<00:00:42.270> game<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:42.750> similar<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
all being an older game very similar to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.420 
all being an older game very similar to

I guess our first impression on
maplestory<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.270> realize<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.289> not

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
maplestory you realize that it's not

everything just looks better they're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
everything just looks better they're
sort<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> standard<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.340> 1080p

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
sort of like a standard you know 1080p

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
even if you are playing even on like

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
even if you are playing even on like
lower<00:01:07.439> resolution<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> still<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
lower resolution you still are going to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
lower resolution you still are going to
see<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.869> harsh<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> guess<00:01:10.799> lines

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
see the just really harsh I guess lines

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.830 
see the just really harsh I guess lines
around<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> characters<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> textures

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
around the characters and the textures

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
around the characters and the textures
and<00:01:12.869> overall<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.650> there's<00:01:13.979> no<00:01:14.100> physics

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and overall you know there's no physics

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
and overall you know there's no physics
update<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.090> no<00:01:15.180> engine<00:01:15.420> update<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
update there's no engine update it's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.010 
update there's no engine update it's
essentially<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> same<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.659> was<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
essentially the same game that it was a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
essentially the same game that it was a
long<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.619> ago<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.159> yeah<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
long time ago I think yeah it's it's a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
long time ago I think yeah it's it's a
unique<00:01:21.420> game<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.049> interesting<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.650> it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
unique game it's interesting it's it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
unique game it's interesting it's it's
got<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> castle<00:01:23.850> crashers<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.390> double

was<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.729> bit<00:01:41.820> better<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.180> had

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
was a little bit better because you had

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
big negative to me is that at the very

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729 
big negative to me is that at the very

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
you can choose a class and I think it is

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.759 
you can choose a class and I think it is
pretty<00:02:13.900> interesting<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.680> have

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
pretty interesting that you do have

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.199 
pretty interesting that you do have
different<00:02:14.890> classes<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:15.580> characters<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
different classes or characters that you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.759 
different classes or characters that you
can<00:02:16.330> utilize<00:02:16.599> but<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:17.379> have<00:02:17.530> much

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
can utilize but you don't have much

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.440 
can utilize but you don't have much
character<00:02:18.069> customization<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.209> start<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
character customization at the start of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.699

the game you do have a lot of things

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.050 
the game you do have a lot of things
that<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:20.920> purchase<00:02:21.190> later<00:02:21.519> on<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.879> think

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
that you can purchase later on I think

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.759 
that you can purchase later on I think
that's<00:02:22.209> cool<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:23.530> would<00:02:23.680> have

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
that's cool but I really would have

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.470 
that's cool but I really would have
liked<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.220> least<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.549> little<00:02:24.879> bit<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.239> base

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
liked at least a little bit of a base

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.570 
liked at least a little bit of a base
customization<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.310> been<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
customization that would have been a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.059 
customization that would have been a
nice<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.349> know<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:29.829> not<00:02:29.890> too

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069

an<00:03:24.250> MMO<00:03:24.609> by<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.000> developers<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.750> says<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.109> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
an MMO by the developers it says it's a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.490 
an MMO by the developers it says it's a
3d<00:03:26.590> beat-'em-up<00:03:27.040> MMO<00:03:27.519> there<00:03:28.060> are<00:03:28.269> some<00:03:28.569> RPG

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
3d beat-'em-up MMO there are some RPG

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.559 
3d beat-'em-up MMO there are some RPG
elements<00:03:29.980> not<00:03:30.099> MMO<00:03:30.519> RPG<00:03:30.760> elements<00:03:31.389> but<00:03:31.450> there

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
elements not MMO RPG elements but there

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.720 
elements not MMO RPG elements but there
are<00:03:31.660> some<00:03:31.810> RPG<00:03:32.230> elements<00:03:32.620> which<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.280> mean<00:03:33.549> maybe

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
are some RPG elements which I mean maybe

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.129 
are some RPG elements which I mean maybe
can<00:03:33.970> be<00:03:34.030> considered<00:03:34.389> pay<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> win<00:03:34.690> because<00:03:34.989> you

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
can be considered pay to win because you

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.170 
can be considered pay to win because you
can't<00:03:35.410> actually<00:03:35.590> allocate<00:03:36.370> different<00:03:36.730> items

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
can't actually allocate different items

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.089 
can't actually allocate different items
to<00:03:37.599> your<00:03:37.690> character<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.109> stats<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.950> can

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
to your character and stats and you can

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.319 
to your character and stats and you can
you<00:03:39.340> have<00:03:39.430> different<00:03:39.609> abilities<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:40.239> you

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
you have different abilities that you

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.439 
you have different abilities that you
can<00:03:40.450> equip<00:03:40.660> as<00:03:40.780> well<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:41.919> it's<00:03:42.160> not<00:03:42.340> an<00:03:42.489> MMO<00:03:43.209> I

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
can equip as well but it's not an MMO I

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.180 
can equip as well but it's not an MMO I
guess<00:03:43.870> there<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.590> an<00:03:44.709> open-world

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
guess there is like an open-world

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.890 
guess there is like an open-world
section<00:03:45.819> where<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.060> go<00:03:46.239> play<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.660> city

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
section where you can go play in a city

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.110 
section where you can go play in a city
